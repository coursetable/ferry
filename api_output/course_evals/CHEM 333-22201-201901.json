I would have enjoyed a more in-depth and rigorous discussion of quantum mechanics instead of spending time on algebraic tricks and spectroscopy. Aside from that complaint though, the class was very well-organized, and I did learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. Vaccaro is a fantastic lecturer and can explain questions in class without hesitation or damaging the pace of the class. 2. His library notes are very clear and his powerpoints and dynamic and rich with information, such that you can miss class and not really be totally destroyed. 3. He provides handouts that do a fantastic job addressing difficult topics or topics where too much time would be taken to explain it in class. 4. His homework is relevant to helping with exams and you learn a lot from doing them and looking at the solutions. 5. Exams are tough but fair as none of the major questions raise pedagogical red flags. Weaknesses: 1. The homework can be VERY algebraic and a sometimes has major \"busy work\" elements to it. The PSETS are relentless so you never get a break from this class. The PSET due the friday AFTER exams start is a huge fucking pain as it siphons time for term papers and other BIG assignments which were strategically placed for them to be worked on during this time. 2. PSETs are often based on work for the NEXT week rather than the one you just finished. This can make it ultra difficult at times because you might not understand what is going on, and are entirely reliant on waiting until lecture/section to figure out what is going on  and that then means you will have some late nights to finish it. 3. His class notes are kept on reserve at the library, meaning you have very limited access to it. It is a lot of text and you can copy with a pencil, but not take photos. This makes it hard to record small details. 4. Exams have almost every little detail being legal, and a reasonable bit of information must be memorized. Sometimes then can be tough because part of the exam becomes contingent on your memorized detail being right or not.  5. Its quantum, where molecules more left and right simultaneously, can potentially move through walls, and oscillate in imaginary time. Regardless of what you do, it will always hurt a little. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic! It is difficult but extremely rewarding. I feel that I learned a lot through lecture, and the problem sets reinforced my understanding through applied problems and taught me material outside the lecture. The graphics and visuals that Professor Vaccaro provides are also outstanding. The exams are difficult but tests everything that is learned in class and on the psets. There is just so much content, and I would not be able to learn it without Professor Vaccaro's phenomenal materials and teaching. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most difficult course I have ever taken at Yale. It is well organized and well-taught. However, I think the workload is unreasonable. I would have struggled with this course if it was my only course this semester. I have never seen problem sets as long as the weekly problem sets for this class. The amount of material covered every week is mind-boggling. Additionally, the professor doesn't like the textbook, so there isn't really anything to reference to help you learn the material besides your own class notes and handouts, which can often be inaccessible to those who do not already understand quantum mechanics well. The exams are insanely difficult and long. Additionally, problem sets were always at least a week ahead of the class material. Again, there was no textbook to teach yourself the material from. This made problem sets much more difficult than necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Exams are basically like problem sets, which was helpful ",
            "\u00a0Pros: very engaging, prof. vaccaro is both caring and funny,and was an introduction into the knowldge of quantum mechanics\r\nCons: Heavy workload, high amounts of math (should be classified as an applied math class, not a chemistry one), and a very fast pace in order for all of the lessons to be covered. ",
            "\u00a0The expectations of this course are entirely unreasonable. I might mention the ridiculousness of meeting during reading period, of having a problem set due the day before the final exam, and of having 4+ hour midterms. The material has the potential to be pretty interesting, but the level at which Vaccaro insists on teaching it, especially after restricting access to course notes and additional resources, is absolute draining and unnecessary. It seems he is convinced this is the only class you will be taking in the semester. He also desperately needs to work on being concise; I know many people who lost points on exams and homeworks simply because they couldn't figure out what the question was actually asking. True and false questions on exams are terrible. The homework is also way out of sequence with the course (homeworks usually cover material you will get to in lecture the following week), which leaves you struggling to learn lots of material by yourself before its taught. Homework assignments (and in some cases exams) are written to be \"instructional\", which essentially means that on top of the unimaginable amount of material Vaccaro wants to get through over the course of the semester, you will be left to teach yourself even more via the homeworks. Would have been nice to have a better sense of how the class was going to be graded / distributed - our exam distribution were very wide, and I have no real sense of how I did despite all the work I put in. ",
            "\u00a0Sam was a great peer tutor. This class was so well organized but still so hard; Vaccaro puts so much into this class and has very high expectations in return. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of work. Would be better to not have a pset over reading week, also the psets sometimes felt confusing because the material was much ahead of the class. Would also love if answer keys were provided for the practice exams so we didnt have to spend section going over it. Pedagogically, this class builds on itself in an amazing way. Prof. Vaccaro puts so much time and effort into it, and you have a lot of opportunities to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Get ready to buckle down and work your ass off.  Vaccaro holds nothing back, including giving you class and a pset during reading week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Vaccaro will do anything and everything in order to help you succeed in class and ensure you have a great enough understanding of everything.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes there is just too much material and its hard to make any sense of it. It was nice that during section we went over the answers to pset problems but this could have been a useful time to review material rather than apply it ",
            "\u00a0This course if difficult and covers a ton of material but there's really no way to improve it without sacrificing some of the material covered. Professor Vaccaro's lectures are so well-done and organized. The handouts are so meticulously done and extremely helpful. He is very available for office hours. There's really nothing that can be improved on. It was the most well organized and constructed class that I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0There really isn't a strength to this course that I can think of. There were many weaknesses to this course that really impacted my interest in physical chemistry, chemistry in general, and science overall. I know that absolutely nothing I will say will cause Vaccaro to change anything because why would 10+ years of detailed suggestions have any effect on him? He clearly believes he has \"perfected\" his courses, which is laughable considering how ineffective it is for the majority of his students. First of all, the homework problem sets are way too long. Every single problem set had mindless and endless number calculations and derivations that were almost always unnecessary ti understanding the concept. Every pset could be reduced by 33% and nothing would be lost and yet students would have way more time to actually learn the concepts. Discussion sections were literally just the TA doing as much of the homework for us, which was ridiculous that the students barely survived with the TA doing large chunks for us. Lectures were so long and detailed that, looking back at your notes, you will have NO idea whats going on. There is class during reading week, which was completely unnecessary and wasted everyones time before finals. Additionally, there was a problem set during reading week, which sucked up evreyone's time to study for this final (and any other final). Vaccaro refuses to publish his notes online like LITERALLY EVERY OTHER PROFESSOR, which is *beyond* ridiculous considering he discovered exactly NONE of the material presented in this course. This is extremely detrimental students who are really trying to meet his high demands. Additionally, the \"physical copy\" of his notes exist only in one copy in the CSSI under lock and key, with limited access during library hours with no photography or scanning allowed. This is ridiculous and systematically discriminates against students who have classes and work during the times which the CSSI was open. I was never able to review the notes before an exam, and it severely impacted my performance. Rather than wasting enough paper to fill 2 Amazonian Rainforests, if Vaccaro just posted his notes online, he would likely see a drastic increase in student performance and comprehension, but of course he won't do this. Finally the tests are ridiculously hard beyond belief, but I know Vaccaro is not going to change that at all. ",
            "\u00a0An organized summary of information to know would have been very, very helpful. Had to sieve through notes, homework, handouts, and practice tests and think about what was really necessary to know. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness is that the course material is very difficult and it takes forever to do it. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that you will learn a lot, but that it will take a lot of work and effort.  Also, the class is very fast paced. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extremely organized class with many different resources to ensure that we have every chance possible to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Physical Chemistry II, at least as taught by Patrick Vaccaro, is yet another one of the infamous courses designed to make Yale STEM students want to drop their major or question their ability and place at this institution. The biggest problem with this course is the way it's steeped in machismo and designed from the beginning to force STEM majors to \"prove themselves\" or change their life plans. This isn't the first (nor will it likely be the last) course at this institution that falls into this category, but at this point in my Yale career I am so thoroughly beaten down and burnt out from juggling course after course full of unreasonable expectations an insensitive professors. This course is designed as if it should be the ONLY course  you are taking, a laughable oversight in the curriculum design given that many students are taking 4 other overly demanding courses alongside this one. When a professor starts off on day 1 saying that the (300 dollar) textbook won't be followed because the well crafted curriculum used by so many other universities doesn't go into enough detail is an immediate red flag - just because we go to Yale does not mean that we should magically have this innate mathematical intuition without ever having seen this material before. Many graduate students in Chemistry commented that the level of mathematical detail that is gone over in this course is far more than they have ever seen in their science careers - a level of rigor that is only reasonable or relevant if you actually desire to pursue a career in quantum chemistry and should be covered at the graduate level, not in a course required for all undergraduates in both Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Aside from some of my above comments which are a commentary on the flaws of Yale Engineering as a whole coming to a head in this course, the PSETs in this course make up one of the more pedagogically flawed curriculums I have seen. Not only are the PSETs weeks ahead of what is being covered in class, they are set up in such a way that they intend for you to learn throughout the process however the questions are phrased in such a way that this becomes an impossible feat. When a single question is comprised of multiple paragraphs of context such that one has to read it five times over to even understand what is being asked (both on PSETs and Exams) you miss points not for lack of trying or understanding but for having no clue what was even being asked. I think that this class would be dramatically improved if the PSETs were reasonably crafted such that they were on schedule with what was being taught and at a level of detail that is slightly more appropriate for an undergraduate course. PSETs shouldn't require more than 20 hours or more each along with pounds of coffee and pounds of tears to complete. Few courses have made me feel as thoroughly defeated and exhausted as this one. Few courses have made me lose as much sleep and sanity as this one. Few courses have made me doubt my intellect as much as this one. Few courses have made me cry as much as this one. I can think of only one other course at this institution that I have been happier to be done with than this one. The material itself has the potential to be really relevant or interesting if it were placed in reasonable context. The one strength I can think of is that Pchem placed in historical context can be quite interesting and relevant and I did like the way the material was presented chronologically like a history class in ways. At the beginning of the semester I actually quite enjoyed this course and it had immense potential but it went way downhill as unreasonable expectations and unnecessary unsolvable math washed over you. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Professor Vaccaro is probably the most dedicated and thorough professor I have ever had. The amount of work he must have put into creating this course is astounding. So, if you are willing to put in the work, this class will teach you quite literally everything you could ever need to know about quantum mechanics from a chemistry-standpoint. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: My only complaint perhaps is that there is too much content covered in the semester, such that it takes away from the class a little. There is just too much material to digest and understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-organized and structured in a way that makes daunting material both manageable and engaging. Professor Vaccaro's lectures are clear and interesting, and he is always willing to meet with students to ensure that everyone can understand the material. The exams are difficult, but fair. ",

For me, the material seemed incredibly dense and complicated and only really started making sense at the end of the year. Things I wished I knew at the beginning of the year:\r\n\r\nA lot of this stuff doesnt make sense, and its not supposed to really. A lot of quantum mechanics I guess is scientists making a ton of measurements and then making a model is based on those measurements even if there is no underlying reason that the model works. Unfortunately sometimes in this class you just have to accept it even if youre the type of person that wants to understand everything.  Other times it makes sense.\r\nMake sure you know the systems: like freely translation particle, and partIcle in a box- that means knowing the general schrodinger equation, the Hamiltonian for it, number of nodes, and figures associated with it. If you know that youre off to a great start. The handouts are helpful but a lot of the time they go way to in-depth. You usually dont have to know how to derive different things when the derivation takes 6 pages.\r\n\r\nPsets if you get to a part of a problem and youve been staring at it for 15 minutes just move on and ask about it at section. Its very easy to get 1 or 2 whole questions of the pset done in section so come having done everything you can do so you can ask about the hard ones. \r\n\r\nAnd dont feel down after you fail the first midterm. If you keep at it, it does get better. And Vaccaro is always there to help even if he seems like hes destroying you with too much material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Quantum Mechanics is so interesting and the class is very well taught and organized. Just be prepared to put in a lot of work into doing the psets (make sure to attend discussion section) and learning the material. You really do get a lot out of this class if you put a lot in. ",
            "\u00a0Welcome to your second death (for those of you who have had either P Chem 1 or P Chem Lab with Vaccaro). It's going to be harder and more difficult than before, and you will gain nothing. I learned NOTHING in this class because every single piece of information was so incomprehensibly difficult that it was almost impossible to learn even simple concepts that, upon failing the midterm, I realized I already knew more or less from gen chem minus the 15 layers of unnecessary difficulty Vaccaro adds. Of course you have to take this class otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. Let me explain to you why this is the hardest course at Yale and amongst the worst (rivaled none other than Vaccaro's own P Chem Lab):\r\nWhen you go to lecture expect to be frantically writing down every single thing Vaccaro writes on the board at a lightning speed. You will understand NOTHING, your notes will make no sense, and you will be given so many handouts that surprisingly make the concepts even more confusing. And if you miss a day of class? Well you might as well just drop out of Yale. Why? Just copy the notes from online right? Duh? WRONG. Unlike ANY OTHER COURSE in the entire universe, Vaccaro refuses to post his notes online (refers to them as his \"intellectual property.\" But don't worry! 32 forests were cut down so that he can make physical copies of his notes! But, wait! There is only one copy of every lecture, placed under lockdown in the CSSI that is only available at very inconvenient times without the ability to take pictures/scan/anything (in fact you can get EXCOMMed for taking pictures of notes talking about things that were invited or discovered over a 100 years ago! Neat! Psssh, well you went to very class because you are a hot shot! Surely that means you are fine right! Wrong! Assuming you went to every class (including the classes during reading week immediately before the final [yes, you read that right]) you then turn to the problem sets every week. Be ready to devote your entire week to scramble to solve the impossible psets. And when you spend over 10 to 15 hours a week on a problem set, you are all set on that material right! WRONG again. You will realize you learned NOTHING from the problem set and you are so confused by it that it was as if you never did it in the first place. \"But I do every problem set early and get 100%,\" you say. Great! Here comes midterm one, over halfway through the semester. Anticipate studying so intensely, realizing you have NO clue whats going on in class, in order to prepare for your FOUR HOUR NIGHTTIME EXAM. What!!!! You say! You are joking right?  A 4 hour night exam? Yup, and that's *not* enough time. You will end up guessing and making up information because the exam is so incredibly difficult that you will never be able to solve it. But the answers were \"obvious\" you will be told when you go and meet with Vaccaro regarding your failing score. \"Okay, well I'll study more for the second midterm.\" Great! The material becomes 300x more difficult and the second midterm is a little over a week before the final, you heard me a week before the final. You will have a problem set due in between that time and 3 classes. Oops. And you won't get back the second midterm until a few days before the final and oops you failed. Then you take the hardest final I've ever had at Yale and walk out realizing you learned nothing. \r\nLet me summarize something to you in case you haven't gotten it by no. This class will take everything from you: your love of school, grades, chemistry, science, etc. You will leave broken and damaged beyond belief, barely scraping by to next year. If you aren't a white male or someone from an elite school, you have no chance at all. But let me make this very clear: YOU DID NOT FAIL THIS CLASS THIS CLASS FAILED YOU. all at the hands of one man who refuses to change a single thing about this course despite the endless reviews and complaints saying so. Have fun and start drinking now !!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Never. You will only take this course with Vaccaro if you are forced to. It is truly degrading to be in it. He acts like you have no other classes. I know he cares about teaching, but it doesn't translate into caring about the students. ",

            "\u00a0You already know the answer ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fantastic class. It's hard, but its worth the time/effort you put into it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not unless you really randomly are already very familiar with quantum mechanics and are very passionate about the subject or you are taking a 3 credit semester (impossible in STEM) and are ready to dedicate an ABSURD amount of time to this course. \r\n\r\nThis is a useless point however as I am fairly sure of the ~40 students enrolled a maximum of 1 are taking this voluntarily. So I have a few recommendations for everyone reading this who has to take it: 1) If you have the choice, absolutely take this course when it is taught by Zilm. I had him in general chemistry and he was wonderful and I have heard by so many upperclassmen that he teaches this course in a more reasonable way. 2) If you have to take this with Vaccaro, mentally prepare yourself for hours and hours of dense PSETs, Midterms that last up to 4.5 hours and end near midnight, and formula sheets that will give you PTSD. With this, do everything you can to lighten your other course load while you struggle through this. Oh, and be prepared to have class during reading period and a PSET due ON THE SAME DAY AS OTHER FINALS. Yes, we had a lengthy PSET due in the middle of finals period, because once again, Vaccaro seems to think you have no other courses or commitments. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the work and not complain, then YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. This class will teach you SO much about quantum mechanics. You will walk away from this class with battle-scars from doing gigantic psets, taking challenging midterms, and studying mountains of material. However, you come out a changed person. Lots of other people reviewing this class are sure to complain about the workload.... Personally, though, high workload is fine with me, as long as it is justified by EQUALLY high dedication from the professor, which is DEFINITELY the case for this class. Professor Vaccaro is THE MOST dedicated professor I have ever had. The man has probably created enough course material to write a whole textbook dedicated to introductory quantum mechanics. Taking this class with Professor Vaccaro was an honor and a privilege. If you are the type of person to shy away from hard work, then this class is not for you. If, however, you feel ready to run the gauntlet that is CHEM 333 with Professor Vaccaro, by all means, best of luck to you. Make sure to enjoy the legendary ride, and may the odds ever be in your favor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class. It was certainly difficult and took a significant amount of time, but if you put in that time you could learn a lot about a fascinating topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course explains the math and physics behind the existence of atomic and molecular orbitals and energy quantization. It was one of the most fascinating classes I've taken but also one of the most challenging. The problem sets and exams are very difficult, but I found myself willing to slog through them because I was interested in the course material. As far as preparedness is concerned the more math and physics you have taken the better you will be; multivariable and diff eq would be helpful especially. Honestly, you really don't need any prior chem experience to take this course. One final note: this class has *absolutely nothing* to do with pchem 1 and covers completely different material. They really should not have the same name. "
