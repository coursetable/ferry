            "\u00a0A knowledge of broadband theory about the sociological process of modernity and postmodernity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of Sociological key historical figures like Weber and Marx, important written works like the Communist Manifesto and the Protestant Ethic, and interesting topics like rural v urban, race, and role of the church. ",
            "\u00a0So it's not apparent at first, but halfway through this course I literally felt my brain making new connections to things. This is more about building a framework by which to interpret the world than substance. It was incredibly helpful to observe and discuss (post)modernity through theoretical and sociological texts, very interesting course! ",
            "\u00a0Learned lots about sociological theory and the concepts behind modernity and post modernity ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about how people interact with one another, how we define modernity, and how society is structured. The class made me a better thinker, familiarized me with other perspectives about the world, and made me more aware of the roots of many modern realities. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I enjoyed the final project and weekly blog posts! The blog posts kept everyone reading the readings and engaging with other posts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly useful for building a framework, class is basically entirely led to student discussion forcing you to flush out and defend basically every claim you make. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes people say really whack things ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how this was run as a seminar, each person brought a very unique perspective to each weeks material which helped with learning ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Great class to learn about sociology and the key theories associated with it ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - one of my favorite classes during my time at Yale. "
