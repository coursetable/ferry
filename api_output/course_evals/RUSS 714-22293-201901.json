            "\u00a0A survey of films from the Soviet Union made from 1924-36 with a focus on the films of Vertov and later additions of films that were influenced by him. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided excellent instruction with regard to film analysis.  Professor MacKay not only offered insight into formal and technical aspects of the films that were analyzed, but established broader cultural and intertextual links that helped students to think critically about film, and about the process of thinking about film.

            "\u00a0A great course if you are interested in the material. The film screenings are amazing and unique opportunity since many of them are on 35mm (which you probably won't have many opportunities to see these films on 35mm outside of this). The only weakness was that the discussion forum part of the course was not as well integrated as it could have. This is not the fault of the professor, but rather students who never or only rarely posted on them. As a result, only a few people posted every week and class discussion was lop-sided to whoever was presenting that week on the films. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was excellent. The course offered a balance of lecture and seminar discussion, and professor MacKay was always available to provide a prompt when needed to enliven the discussion. Though the course was primarily concerned with early-Soviet film, looking at films from different cultural and artistic traditions and how they relate to Soviet film was very productive in discussing the role of early-Soviet film in a more diachronic context. The course could possibly be improved by including a wider range of film creators, however, time constraints are likely responsible for any limitations of this sort. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about Soviet cinema, you could not ask for a better course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in Russian and Soviet culture, as well as film more broadly. "
