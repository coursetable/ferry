            "\u00a0The title says it all. A more humanistic, nuanced approach to a topic that may often seem unwieldy or difficult to penetrate. If you enjoy the intricacies of human behavior, but still want to link that in with the bigger picture of life in contemporary capitalism, this class is for you. Even if it's not you should take it because honestly it's an amazing class, my classmates were amazing, the readings were thoroughly enjoyable, and Doug is just an absolute gem. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. Please keep in mind when considering it that it's very heavy on the anthropology and methods of anthropology (which I loved!). It truly provides a unique and fresh perspective to capitalism and its impact on the world. I see it in a new light as a social construct and agent that humans have power over. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how capitaism functions in practice and the skills of anthropology. it is a reminder to not always jump for theory ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned how to better read a text that I will not immediately understand, or even understand after 3 read-throughs. I learned about what the discipline of anthropology is, and how to do an interview in that context. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I truly had no idea how to articulate anything about economics. I've gained a variety of lenses through which I can now analyze economic activities and other aspects of life which I previously considered to be unrelated to capitalism. I have a much better idea of what makes capitalism distinct and how it's qualities shape my everyday experiences. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered a useful critical lense in analyzing our capitalist economic system. ",
            "\u00a0great introduction to capitalism, the economy and anthropology! ",
            "\u00a0This was my first anthropology course, so learned SO much better what the task of the field is, its method, the central questions at hand. I felt like the assignments really deftly help me apply the theoretical frameworks of Marx, Smith, etc. (other anthropological thinkers that posit ideas about capitalisms influence in our life) and apply it to real-world situations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach and understand capitalism as well as how to work on an ethnography. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Keep doing you, Doug! Honestly this course cannot be improved more. Fascinating readings, great seminar discussions, and an absolutely rewarding final project. The midterm was annoying because as a weak writer, I like going over my writing with others, but I understand where Doug is coming from with the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing readings, excellent professor, interesting things to talk about\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions could be a little more guided/organized\r\n\r\nBecause the group project is kind of a thing: I personally LOVED it and it's an amazing chance to do fieldwork. That said, I got lucky in that this was the least stressful group project of all time. Remember that this is a major part of the class and the grade; please appreciate it as a learning experience and something that should be fun! ",
            "\u00a0this course could be better if the weekly discussions did not start so open because it took a while to reach depth with conversations ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting. The sophomore-only seminar is a huge bonus for those who may not have had the opportunity to learn how-to-seminar in other classes before. The approach to learning capitalism was quite clear at the beginning -- starting by understanding not-capitalist systems, then moving onto Marx, Weber, and Smith. But halfway through the course, it became a little unclear the path we were taking to understand capitalism since some of the readings seemed disjoint. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the readings for the course were very strong, and an appropriate amount was assigned for each week. However, I wish seminar had been more focused on discussing the readings rather than some of the personal experiences of students in the class. Some seminars veered into irrelevance because the discussion got out of hand. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it is so special that this course is a sophomore only seminar. There need to be more classes like this! I really enjoyed being exposed to so many different thinkers through the readings. And the large class size also added to my experience in ways that I was not expecting. I wish that we had more explicitly diagramed out the key points of some of the more technical readings. I also did not care for the last book we read (and the professor admitted that he didn't really like it either). I understood the value in reading it since it demonstrated our ability to grapple with a book of that complexity, but I feel like a more enjoyable text should be chosen. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the discussion in this course-- Professor Rogers was a good seminar leader. I felt like the final project was not given enough time in the semester, and so was not as deep as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0the readings were hard at times, but overall class discussions were engaging ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED the readings the flow was also incredible. Going from straight theory to ethnography was also a great progression. I also thought assignments were a great way to apply knowledge to real-world scenarios. At times, I wish discussions were more structured, however. And perhaps, at the end, I wished there could be some way to wrap up and review the knowledge/questions from the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the readings of this course were selected very purposefully and organized very well in the sense that each week built upon the previous week's materials.  I think that class discussions lent themselves to facilitating learning, and I always felt that each class was engaging and interesting.  I wouldn't change anything about this course, and I think this was one of the best courses that I've ever taken here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The course has fascinating readings and the final project was very engaging. However, the discussions could sometimes heavily wander from the readings and turn into more philosophical and political arguments. I believe it could be of benefit to curve these conversations a little more to bring them back to the topic discussed. In addition, the final project had a very tight timeline which caused stress due to the difficulty of setting up and performing interviews in a short timespan. I believe it would be valuable to establish groups and topics before spring break so that students have more time to reach out to contacts and schedule times to meet with them. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It doesn't matter if you lean right or left, if you are interested in the topic or not, after this class you will not have regretted it! It teaches you so much about capitalism, yes, but also about what it means to be human! And who doesn't want that? ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class if you're a sophomore. It's one of the most meaningful classes I've taken at Yale. It changed the way I view the world. ",
            "\u00a0yes especially if you are a theory oriented student seeking to expand your intellectual toolkit ",
            "\u00a0If you are a social science major looking to get to know a group of fellow sophomores interested in anthropology, I recommend the course. Though the class does not have prerequisites, knowing what to expect from an ethnography would help you tremendously going in. Professor Rogers is an excellent instructor, however I felt that most seminars veered off course, probably because most students did not do the reading. Additionally, I felt Prof. Rogers could have done more to keep the discussion on track. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that this class is a sophomore seminar. Despite the good intentions of the instructor, I think this format detracted from my intellectual experience in the class. I have found in my other seminars so far that upperclassmen have much more valuable ideas to contribute. \r\n\r\nLastly, there is a group project at the end of the term that is a pain to complete. If you have a good, hard-working group, it will have been worth it. But I fear that this particular class attracts students who are not willing to put in the effort necessary to get a lot out of the final project. Definitely keep this in mind when shopping the course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! It's both a pretty chill class and one that you can really get a lot out of if you give the readings enough time. ",
            "\u00a0YES! PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. I think it would be very useful for any student looking to dedicate their studies to economics or even a career a financial field to view capitalism from a critical angle so that they can provide the world with truly meaningful work. ",
            "\u00a0yes! it's a good introduction to anthropology, the economy, and capitalism as a system ",
            "\u00a0YES. I loved this course. It gave me an entirely new framework for examining human experience, through the lens of capitalism and economic structure. Easily one of the classes ive discussed most with friends. Its more than just a class about economics though its about culture, gender, race, and the narratives propagated by ourselves and others. The readings were incredible, and Prof. Rogers was a really giving and thoughtful discussion leader. This is especially great as an intro anthro course its the first one ive ever taken, and im definitely going to explore the department more. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  I feel that the class discussions helped to improve my individual interpretations of the texts and personal understanding of the readings, and I always thought that the readings were engaging and interesting.  I enjoyed the discussions in this class so much that I hardly ever felt like I was actually working in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course and a beautiful introduction both to seminar-style classes and anthropology. I would highly recommend this course to anyone vaguely interested in capitalism and/or anthropology. "
