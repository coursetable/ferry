            "\u00a0thinking about what role the humanities might play in mitigating climate change ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the critical role that humanities plays in the the discussion of climate change, especially when assessing the impact on different and often overlooked communities and communicating the realities of climate change to non-scientists, non-academics, and deniers. ",
            "\u00a0Reinterpretation and re-evaluation of a diverse and stilmulating body of literature relating, directly or indirectly to climate change and the human response to a changing world. Lots of critical thinking, lots of breaking down of the mainstream narrative, lots of reflection of the self and society as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0In this class the role of people affecting changes in society and climate was thoroughly discussed; it was a valuable space for discussion and comparison of past and current depictions land what they mean today. From Gilgamesh to Pope Francis to the recent IPCC report, this class used a time based approach to help contextualize what different cultures and people have moralized about the world around them. \r\nFrom this class I have learned to apply a much more in depth understanding of the various social pressures that create climate change and to understand how undervalued humanities based approaches are vs. \"science to the rescue\" mentalities (that ignore the social causes of pollution, wealth inequality, and environmental irresponsibility) ",
            "\u00a0This course emphasized interdisciplinary thinking and writing about the far-reaching impacts of climate change. The course offered a look at the intellectual history of environmentalism, while offering a rigorous treatment of the subject through a humanities lens. I learned critical skills in interrogating works and extrapolating meaning. The works we read and conversations they yielded was always fruitful. This course improved my critical thinking and writing capabilities by challenging me to deal with a complex topic with clarity and brevity. ",
            "\u00a0Thanks to this course, I was better able to critically analyze rhetorical techniques in modern writing, and read older piece of literature for specific themes (which usually are overshadowed for other things). Further, this course was an excellent way to use skills in the humanities to analyze a largely scientific problemclimate change. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about intersecting climate issues; the challenges ahead ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the environmental humanities. ",
            "\u00a0More or less an intellectual history of climate change. ",

            "\u00a0Thought about climate change mostly as a societal issue as opposed to a scientific one. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the skills necessary to approach literary texts as an environmentalist, and came away with a lot of new perspectives on human nature, history, the modern economy, and the relationship between humans and other species on Earth. "

            "\u00a0strengths: seminar means you work with your peers to understand questions, syllabus is quite good and interdisciplinary, weaknesses: sometimes readings are quite short, which is good because it means people do them, but sometimes means we don't go into as much depth in discussion ",
            "\u00a0The course facilitated insightful discussion and had interesting materials from varying sources (scientific reports to academic critiques to more colloquial works to fiction) which contributed to our holistic understanding of climate change and how different people may interpret it. To strengthen the course, I would love to see more guest lecturers since it's one thing to read about a perspective and another to hear about it and have a discussion with a person who holds that perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely incredible in-class discussion. My best seminar at Yale and let me tell you Ive seen it all. Katja is incredible and the amount of work she put into this class, from its conception to its execution is just awe-inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: the seminar style was extremely valuable in this class. The readings were always an appropriate length such that they were interesting and informative without being unmanageable. Almost everyone consistently did the readings, which is so much more enjoyable than a similar class with more readings where half the people have done half the reading while the rest didn't even try to read the book. The coursebook format was also very helpful. The Professor consistently asked questions that were helpful for discussion and tied in the skills we were building \r\nWeaknesses: overall this was a very well taught class, but adding in other canons (indigenous, eastern, etc.) with some contextualization would be helpful to explore \"environmental immagination\". I think emphasizing the idea of environmental imperialism and understanding how authors works are accepted within academic vs. Layman communities is also valuable ",
            "\u00a0The seminar format is this course's key strength. The ideas presented in the readings seem to be most fully explored through discussion. The conversational nature of the course also assists in the preparation for the written submissions. Without the conversational texture offered by a seminar format, I doubt the course would have been as rigorous and engaging as it was. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by perhaps having reading responses respond to particular questions. While I generally enjoyed the freedom of this course (allowing students to select basically any topic related to the course to explore), it might have been more academically rigorous to have us answer more specific questions in reading responses at least. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest speakers; I was not particularly sold on the YUAG visits fit within the course. I enjoyed how we brought relevant, newsworthy materials into the seminar discussion. I would have liked more direct questioning and facilitation from our Professor.\r\n\r\nThis class works best as a Seminar!! I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates and learning collaboratively. \r\n\r\nPerhaps a longer/more specific midterm paper to develop ideas better. ",
            "\u00a0Great content, amazing professor, great students. More field trips and non-traditional assignments could definitely improve the course. It would be great if we could have at least one assignment that was more creative than analytic. One other idea, Katja has a lot of interesting things to say, so while I'm not a fan of lectures generally, maybe one lecture day would be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think Katja is very good at encouraging discussions of the material and I think the material itself is very compelling. If anything I think there could have been a little bit more. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't find the weekly reading responses that helpful-- would have preferred an extra paper instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Interdisciplinary material was extremely engaging! Especially for the topic of climate change, it brought a new outlook that is unique among the classes at Yale that are about this topic. \r\n-Guest speakers brought an added level of an expertise and insight into new fields (especially when looking at arts and media)\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n-A practical assignment option for the final paper such as a media project or intervention of some kind ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fabulous course. Low, but meaningful workload and Professor Lindskog is great at leading discussion without dominating it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that some of the earlier readings (Gilgamesh, Voluspa) didn't really tie into the course as well as they could have. I think there is value to having them on the syllabus, but some more work from the beginning of the year to put them in the context of climate change would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0In general I really enjoyed our discussions, and it seemed like almost everyone in the class had a lot to say. The topics we discussed, from economics to social justice to writing history, all resonated with everyone emotionally, and prompted a lot of genuine and thought-provoking conversation. At times I thought so many of the readings prompted us to turn against the author, and we spent more time criticizing them than praising them, but I don't think this was necessarily a problem. I enjoyed our talks with guest lecturers, but I just wish we had been a little more prepared for those conversations before we actually met with those lecturers. I also enjoyed our trip to the art gallery, but I struggled to see how it was totally relevant to what we had talked about in class. Still, it was interesting to look at environmentalism in \"the humanities\"-- including painting, archaeology, poetry, and film-- instead of just in writing. I also thought it might have been interesting to spend some more time talking about extremely current writing, like the recent climate agenda from the US government and the manifesto by the Pope. Aside from that, my only other criticism would be that we sometimes did not get to discuss all of the reading during class. I thought the reading workload was very reasonable, but maybe assigning slightly fewer readings or making a more detailed plan for class discussions might help ensure that we get to discuss all the material in person.

            "\u00a0yes, if you're interested in climate change. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! With a very manageable workload (we had a 250 word reading response almost every week, plus two papers), an interesting, relevant, and unique topic, and Professor Lindskog, I highly recommend this course to anyone who cares about the climate change discussion (which I hope is everyone). ",
            "\u00a0Y E S. If youre interested in climate change, the environment, literature, a great instructor, fun. ",
            "\u00a0I already have recommended this class to other students, for multiple reasons. The Professor is fantastic, the seminar style class dynamic is very enjoyable (we even learned each others names), the reading and discussion was always worth the time and effort. My perspective and ethical framework both changed as a result of being more informed but also because I was forced to challenge my own assumptions. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. As a graduating senior, it was one of my favorite courses I've taken. Students will be introduced to very compelling writing and examine works through a new and interesting lens. The curriculum is so well crafted and well planned that I remained deeply engaged for the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent class: I recommend this to any student interested in both literature and climate change. Katja Lindskog is a brilliant professor, so especially if she is teaching, you will notice that her feedback will not only help you develop your writing skills, but the way you think. This is an optimal class for interdisciplinary studies, and a true example of the liberal arts. ",
            "\u00a0This class felt urgent and eye-opening. I would recommend to anyone interested in todays climate crisis or interested in the way humanities and sciences intersect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great course. Definitely take this if you're at all interested in the environmental humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved the class, it wasn't too hard and I learned a lot and I thought it was fun and has influenced what I want to do with my life, a great way to get into climate change as a field if you have previously mostly been a humanities person. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a very unique approach to the topic of climate change and will broaden your thinking about how humans have faced environmental disaster and how possible solutions may work in the future. The relatively lighter work load also encourages you wanting to engage in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. There are few courses that can manage to be as engaging as this one while maintaining a very reasonable (honestly pretty light) workload and this struck a great balance. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any other student at Yale; I think the subject matter is something that everyone should learn to think about, and practice thinking about regularly. I would especially recommend the course to students who are interested in connecting history and literature to social and political issues that are relevant today. "
