            "\u00a0All about syntax. More about syntax than I thought even existed in this world. ",
            "\u00a0A richer understanding of grammar/grammaticality. Insights into how humans organize and compile language. The ability to draw syntactic trees. A framework through which any language can be studied.  Awareness of structural components of a sentence even when not audible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much! This is in part because I knew nothing about linguistics before this course.  So, first and foremost, I learned what linguistics and syntax are, and how they offer insights into cognition. Over the semester, I learned about generative grammar and X Bar theory. I learned how to analyze a sentence structurally. I learned what differences and similarities across languages can reveal to us about underlying grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some of the foundational findings of mainstream generative syntax : concepts like c-command, locality, binding, and skills like how to analyze the structural relations between constituents and how to analyze the argument structure of predicates. I also really honed my general scientific method skills by getting tons of practice (and receiving detailed feedback!) on how to form an hypothesis, back it up with evidence drawn from data, and revise when challenges surface. Learning about how much the field has \"overturned\" itself over the course of its development because of emergence/discovery of new data was a refreshing experience, as such revision process is an inherent component of any scientific endeavor that does not get talked about enough in most courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at language and linguistics from a new perspective. I was introduced to the concept of generative grammar. I learned how to draw syntax trees to explain why some sentences are grammatical and why other sentences are ungrammatical. We also used trees to explain linguistic variation. There is no wrong way to speak, any variation gives us more clues as to how to continue building the idea of generative grammar. Everybody has their own mental grammar that was informed by input in their language acquisition device during development, and it was interesting to see how that differed among different groups and different individuals. I learned how to explain things using X-bar theory. How to think in terms of a hypothesis and providing evidence to support the hypothesis. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first linguistics class I took at Yale, and it was by far my favorite class of the semester. As an intro to Syntax, it develops one's intuition and inquiry about syntax really well, and provides a great foundation for further study of the subject. Enjoyed the class and the professor - and the weekly problem sets were challenging and interesting enough to better facilitate learning and engagement in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches all the key components of syntax, and helps students gain insights into language in general, that can be extended to languages beyond English.  Some interesting topics included: treatment of different types of intransitive verbs, movement of wh-phrases (e.g., what, who) when forming a question from a declarative, and lots more!  After taking this course, you will hear things the people around you produce and question why a certain word was used some way, and if all native speakers of English speak that way, or only a particular group. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze sentences and break them down from the perspective of a linguist. I learned a lot about the basics of linguistics and what it means to analyze language. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to syntax, both in theory and practical analysis. You will find yourself listening more intently at what people say and trying to figure out why they say it the way they do after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skills to think more critically about sentence structure and syntax in my own language which I will also be able to use when learning a new language in the coming semesters. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives a good introduction to the field of syntax within linguistics. It covers the major topics such as c-command and movement that are useful across disciplines in linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to generative syntax. We cover X-bar Theory, Theta Theory, and various types of movement and each movement's motivation. I feel that I have a strong foundation in syntax and know what good questions in the field would be. ",
            "\u00a0We started out with the basic tenets and underlying reasons for a theory of generative grammar, and proceeded to learn how to evaluate constituents in a sentence. We then moved on to discussing important relations in syntactic theory, such as c command and binding theory. The second half of the course consisted of learning the tenets of features of X Bar theory, followed by an overview of different types of movement that can take place in a sentence, as well as how these movements can account for structural differences between languages. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough knowledge of the principles of generative grammar and basic syntax, with enough experience to accurately diagram the majority of sentences in English. I also gained insight into the way modern linguistic research is done, as well as historical perspectives on how syntactic theories evolved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how the human mind models syntax, the underlying structure of language. I learned about the universalities and the small ways languages differ. I learned how to provide evidence and make an argument for syntactic analyses. ",
            "\u00a0This course walked us through the basic theories of generative grammar, working up from a simple model to the concepts of movement, case, theta-roles, and x-bar theory. It taught us to use the scientific method in linguistics, creating and testing our theories again and again to refine our model of syntax. ",
            "\u00a0Syntax I teaches you the basics - and more - of syntax. Prof. Zanuttini is clear from the beginning: the course teaches what is largely agreed upon in the syntax community. If there was scholarly dissent to what she was teaching, she made it known to us, so we could learn more about topics we weren't going to discuss, which was nice. You come out of the course with a very solid understanding of syntax and how to conduct basic syntactic analysis. If you're familiar with syntax from other classes, the beginning might feel a little slow, but once you start doing movement and Theta Criterion, things pick up. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Very niche information, but taught me so much about the grammars of the world's languages. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: Zanuttini made class a warm and inviting (she even spent the first few classes introducing us to one other), fostering lively discussion. The class often challenged our assumptions on language. The use of many languages in addition to English supplemented and contextualized the material. A deep understanding of many new topics. Section was optional, there for when we needed them but also not required of those who felt comfortable with the material. \r\n\r\nWeakness: can move a little slowly at times. Tangents occurred frequently (though admittedly, I liked them). \r\n\r\nImprovement: Zanuttini offered summary handouts for some of the tougher sections. These would have been awesome for unites like X-Bar theory and Binding theory. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the course is the engagement. Raffaella does a brilliant job of bringing students into the class and making them feel welcome. Concepts are introduced and then edited, following a logical progression for a learner. Some areas of improvement might be: (1) I think the pace of the class is at first very slow, and then rapidly accelerates, so keeping a more even pace might help. (2) I think the best way to master this material is practicing solving problems, often with others.  One way to take advantage of this is in section! If I could change one thing, it would be the format of sections. I think in section, it would be ideal if students were given a worksheet to complete together or on their own, and then at the end, the TA would go through every single answer, and a key would be provided to take home. (3) Something else that I loved and that really helped my learning were the notes summaries and overviews provided by Raffaella. Because our model is changing as we learn, it's very helpful to have a recap on paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the assignments and assessments were well structured and the expectations were usually pretty clear. Prof. Zanuttini is very patient, very approchable, and very kind, which made the class enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know if this is really a weakness of this course per se (as opposed to a weakness of the field of syntax when the necessary integration with the other aspects of language is overlooked), but one thing that really didn't sit too well with me was how unprincipled and stipulative a lot of the theories seemed. I understand that this is only Syntax I so we weren't able to dive deeply enough into a lot of the nuances, but I wish we had talked more about the status and role of syntax in linguistic analysis (i.e. what it can and should try to account for) and its relationship with other aspects of language (especially with semantics, since a lot of the hypotheses seemed at least partially driven by semantics). Since this class does not have LING 110 as a prerequisite (which is fine) and a lot of us came in to the class without any prior exposure to the field linguistics, I would say it is worth the effort to present  at least a general view of the architecture of language in the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the material and how organized it was for learning in class. I think logistically it's important to have set dates for the midterms because this isn't the only class that students are taking. Students need to know when the exams are so that they can plan all their courses in advance. I think having pre-set exams is pretty standard for classes here, and it would be very helpful for future students who are looking to take this class. I think this class needs huge improvement on the logistics side of things overall. Canvas needs to be updated in a consistent manner so that we all get feedback in a timely manner and know our standing. PSETS should be handed back every week instead of all at once right before a midterm. Section was highly unstructured, as we would often be sitting there in silence. It should be more structured and planned to have practice problems that incorporate the material learned or a mini lesson to recap some of the material learned. While it is good to ask the students what they would like to learn, it is also important to have structure and purpose in section, or else people will find no use in going. Another improvement I would suggest is moving through the beginning of the course more quickly. We mainly focused on X-bar theory rather than flat structure by the end of the course, and x-bar theory is really the more interesting stuff. I think the class was too eurocentric. It was always about the romance or germanic languages, and I got super tired of hearing oh if you studied romance languages you'd see this, or romance languages are like this. What about all the other languages out there? Show us that X-bar theory isn't something that only works with the European languages. Please diversify the language data. We got on tangents often, mostly because students would disagree with each other on grammaticality judgements just for the sake of disagreement and throwing off the class momentum, which bothered me so much. In my opinion, when Raffaella is trying to make a point, just let her finish and then voice your disagreements later so that we actually get to the course material for the psets. Having homework answer keys would be really helpful for studying for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Overall great. The problem sets are challenging, but all in good measure. It's definitely not a 'gut' class, and it does require some previous experience with linguistics to do well and understand the topics. ",
            "\u00a0The way the course is taught is very novel and engaging.  Concepts are presented first as a hypothesis, and then examples and potential counterexamples are investigated to verify why the concept makes sense.  All topics are covered incredibly thoroughly, and homework assignments do a good job of facilitating learning.  The textbook is definitely a good choice for an introductory syntax class, as it highlights key topics and gives clear examples and practice questions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was really great, the material was engaging and the lecture style was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are an interesting subject matter and very very strong teaching. The only slight weakness was that it would have been nice to get those handouts a bit earlier in the semester (before we went off textbook), but that was a small thing! ",
            "\u00a0Raffaella's teaching style and the structure of the class as a lecture with high participation and discussion were the biggest strengths. At times it felt like we were spending too much time reviewing instead of moving ahead with new material, but since the topics all built on each other throughout the semester, the review was also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I think Raffaella is the template for what a professor should be. This material was not immediately clear and easy for me,  and Im fully convinced that I did so well because she was the one teaching the class. The book was pretty good overall, but being in class and listening to her teach with such clarity and passion is really the best way to get good at syntax. She was a huge blessing this semester and I always looked forward to coming to class. There are very few professors who have the teaching gene the way Professor Zanuttini does, even at a highly sought after school like Yale. I am going to do everything I can to take another class with he before I graduate because she is the kind of professor that makes you feel justified in paying so much for an education!\r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses go, its hard to think of much to improve. The class structure was just really great. The homework was fair and balanced, and just enough work to keep you thinking about the material all the time. Jessica was also a very good TA and offered a very different style of explanation for the material that was a great supplement to lectures. This was one of the few classes where I always felt that coming to Section was worth it.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion I can really think of is that slightly more partner work or in class demonstrations from students could be helpful once we start drawing trees. I think you do the most learning in syntax when you just start drawing trees again and again, and concsciously thinking about where each element is getting case, which principles are dictating movement, etc. It can be intimidating to draw in front of the class but I think a communal tree-drawing based discussion could be a good way to get everyone on the same page. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting and very clear on what we needed to know, and the homeworks were very fair and straightforward. Nothing really to improve! This is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The class started fairly slowly and it felt like it really sped up around the middle. Maybe less time could be spent on constituents, etc to give more time to learn the topics from the second midterm ",
            "\u00a0The course moved at an appropriate pace and taught skills and information as needed. Discussion section with the TA was highly beneficial as a review of the material from the previous week of class. There were two smaller midterms and one cumulative final exam which was ultimately beneficial to learning. We knew what to expect on each of the later exams. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always very engaging, and always clarified any confusing parts of the reading. The professor was also very accommodating to the students' needs, and made a great effort to get to know everyone in the class personally. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were excellent, homework sets are the perfect length, I found the TA-led sections to be redundant and ultimately not worth attending. Lecture notes started to be handed out near the end of the course, but would have been helpful in the middle around the difficult material. ",
            "\u00a0I think pretty much everything was a strength. The class was well-balanced and well-paced. I liked the structure of exams and homework. The professor and TA were exceptional. I liked that the class was small enough to be engaging without putting a lot of pressure on just a few people. The structure of how we learned about syntax was also very good, with each concept building on top of previous ones so you don't forget what you learned. The homeworks were great preparation for the exam questions. Section was helpful but not strictly necessary (though I saw my homework grades go up a lot once I started going). ",
            "\u00a0This course moved at a perfect pace, with the lectures supplemented by the readings from the textbook. The lectures were always engaging, never one-sided, and always open to questions. This course has no weaknesses at all, and anyone interested in English, language, or even science should consider taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has very few weaknesses. Prof. Zanuttini has nearly perfected this course, it seems. One potential weakness could be that it moves a little slowly in the beginning, but this may be necessary for those who aren't familiar with linguistics, so I don't think I'd even call that a weakness. One certain weakness was the optional section: it was difficult to justify attending it given how unhelpful and boring it tended to be. Other than that, the course is superbly organized, well-paced, and satisfying in depth and breadth of content. Raffaella encourages a laid-back atmosphere in and out of class, encouraging us to work together in groups for the problem sets, which (while sometimes tedious - unavoidable!) were well-crafted and successfully pushed us to further our understanding of concepts we learned in class. The class is a small lecture with a moderate-high amount of class participation, but she doesn't cold call unless she KNOWS you know the answer. She also makes a concerted effort to foster community in the class by having everyone do an introduction (including hometown and interests) over the first 7-8 classes or so. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you are interested in syntax! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Zanuttini is a blast and syntax is fun. Every class feels like \"! ooh that's interesting. I didn't know that.\" The material feel intuitive and is strictly logical. ",
            "\u00a0I know Syntax is one of the more popular linguistics classes, but I personally would not recommend it unless youre a linguistics major or love syntax for some reason. It is very systematic and technical, and just not for everyone unless you like that kind of stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who is seriously interested in linguistics. I think it is a pretty niche subject, so this class would be a poor choice for a student who finds syntax boring or completely unintuitive. If someone has a general interest in linguistics, I think an introductory Linguistics course would better suit them.  That being said, I really loved the class, and I loved the professor. I am happy knowing that this class challenged me in new ways and has given me a new appreciation for and understanding of language. Still, I took it with the intention of fulfilling a requirement for my major, and had this not fulfilled a requirement, I would not have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0It really depends on what you're hoping to get out of the class. If you're a linguistics major, well, you kind of don't have a choice, though I would recommend taking a more general class (e.g. Intro to Ling, Language and Mind, CogSci of Language or maybe even Illusions of Language) before jumping into Syntax I because you would have a clearer idea of the role syntax plays and feel better situated as a result. If you are not a linguistic major and are checking out the class because of an interest in, say, foreign languages or grammar, I say to you: 1) heyyy fellow language enthusiast!! and 2) it might be a good idea to borrow the textbook and skim a few chapters to see if this is an approach you would like to take. To be honest, I think Syntax 1 kind of leaves things at an awkward place  some of your views on how \"grammar\" works will be challenged, which is not a bad thing, except the class doesn't quite get to the place where you feel empowered and prepared (maybe?) to undertake further explorations to build your world back up with the newly gained insights. Yes, you will learn about some findings and generalizations that make you go, \"wow, that makes sense!\", but you will also find yourself having to just \"accept\" some theories at such a low level of resolution (or dare I say rigor) that it almost feels unsettling. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a linguistics major, you have to take it. It isn't too painful with Raffaella, although the weekly PSETs tend to be long. Raffaella is great at explaining and breaking down the material. This class is good for STEM majors looking for a social science class because it is applying hypothesis like thinking to linguistics. The beginning of the course is slow, but once you get to X-bar theory, it starts to get interesting and straightforward. I didn't really study for the final, and I still think I did okay. It's pretty logical after X-bar theory. As long as you know how to draw the tree and what to put where and how to perform movement operations, it is quite self-evident. It gets much better as the course progresses. Just keep in mind that there are weekly psets and work your schedule around those. Make sure you find a solid group to work on the pset with every week. It is absolutely *crucial* to work with others in this class to succeed. If you are not a white student, you might feel left out and unrepresented because the language data is very eurocentric, focusing on Romance and Germanic languages. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this course, it was a great time and very interesting throughout. I have a newfound appreciation of syntax trees. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  It will make you look at language a different way, and will probably also help you while learning new languages! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a lot of fun and not too hard even without any background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend that any students interested in linguistics, syntax, or grammar more generally take this course. It is a core course for the linguistics major, but even if you arent a major or thinking of becoming one, this course is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in linguistics and want to learn more about why we speak the way we do. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody regardless of your interests. Syntax is required for linguistics students but for anybody else, taking this class will open doors for you in terms of seeing the world of language in a new light, and understanding why we speak the way we do. It might be dangerous to recommend this class to everyone though, because this is the sort of class that could convert pretty much anybody to become a linguistics major! ",
            "\u00a0If youre at all interested in linguistics, you should take this class. Especially if Raffaella is teaching it. Youll learn a lot about syntax, obviously, and get good practice using evidence to back up claims and a lot of opportunities to practice LaTeX if youre into that. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Raffaella is a literal angel, she does everything she can to make the class better, even asking us when it is convenient for our schedules to have the midterms. Syntax is really interesting as a subject and youll learn a lot about language and why we say certain things but not others. I hadnt taken any other linguistics classes and I felt like that wasnt a problem. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not for the light hearted, but it is perfectly manageable by anyone. Raffaella is an extremely fair instructor and will guide you through the material, though you will have a leg up if you are interested in linguistics. The readings are very helpful, but Raffaella does cover everything in class. The exams test the material we learn in class exactly as expected. There are never any curveball questions or any need to cram large amounts of information that you didn't know ahead of time. This was my favorite class I had this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. It's required for all linguistics majors, and in my opinion, it's a excellent introduction to the major. It may help to take an intro linguistics class before taking this, but it's definitely doable without an intro. Professor Zanuttini is wonderful and engaging, and does a great job to make sure that the problem sets reinforce the skills that we learn in class. Additionally, the field of syntax itself is very interesting, and is worth becoming familiar with on an introductory level. ",
            "\u00a0I had not taken any prior linguistics courses, and this course was full of linguistics majors. Nevertheless, this was an excellent introduction to the subject, and I would fully recommend it to anyone interested. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. It is kind of a niche subject so I don't think it will be very helpful in my future as a computer science major. However, it was pretty interesting and provided really interesting insight into how languages work. So it may be helpful for learning languages in the future! In any case, I have a passing interest in linguistics which was enough to sustain me through this class. I didn't need much outer encouragement because the professor was so incredible at teaching. There was very little extra effort required because the class was so well-taught. It was a good size and actually pretty fun -- just be sure to pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course, but definitely difficult. It's framed as something of an introductory course, but I wouldn't recommend taking it without at least some prior knowledge of syntax. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a linguistics major, take this course as soon as possible. It is a great foundation in thinking scientifically about language, and presents multiple views on the subject. If you aren't studying linguistics, but have any interest in language, cognitive science, English, or any language related field, this course is still for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Raffaella makes it difficult to dislike syntax. It is one of the most balanced courses I have ever taken: the workload felt substantial enough to be fulfilling, but not so much that it was overwhelming at any point. The content itself was stimulating and the exercises felt nontrivial. Nearly every problem set challenged us to think outside the box and defend positions on contentious syntactic claims, which was good practice for linguistics papers in the future. I would recommend this course to anyone, linguistics student or not, even if they didn't have any prior linguistics experience. "
