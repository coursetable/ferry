            "\u00a0An excellent overview of the major literature surrounding the social history of early modern England. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the literature, with plenty of room for tailoring readings to ones needs. ",
            "\u00a0The course increased my familiarity with early modern social history, which I had used before as context to intellectual and ecclesiastical history but not in and of itself. It also allowed me time to read some of the classics in the genre which I thoroughly enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushed me to read a lot more and a lot more widely. Professor Wrightson really stressed the importance of writing a \"book review\" type essay, which encouraged students to engage with secondary sources (which often get short changed compared to primary sources in my previous projects). Overall the type of writing and reading in the course has pushed me beyond my comfort zone and I benefited a lot from it. "

His intellectual imagination, as reflected in his teaching, is remarkable, and the care and attention he accords to the class (he meets students individually to go over each paper) reflects his ethos as a scholar. ",
            "\u00a0A little more structure in discussions could help to propel the conversation forward; it often felt like we lingered around points without making any new observations before someone would change the topic completely. ",
            "\u00a0There was a bit of confusion with the syllabus in terms of what topics were covered when, which made gathering books difficult at times. However, this was cleared up relatively quickly. Overall a strong course in terms of structure and execution. "
