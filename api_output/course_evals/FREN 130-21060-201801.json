            "\u00a0There should be at least a few days when the class does not meet to limit fatigue. Instead, students take their own days off which gets the class out of sync and makes the prof's life harder. Also, the way the vocab was tested was not effective in measuring my comprehension. There were many instances where I knew the meaning of the words and of the phrases but simply could not remember every single one of the words we had to memorize. The vocab sections tested my recall rather than my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that you marginally improve your French knowledge (but not anywhere near as much as the French department thinks or advertises).\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the class was that we never actually spoke in French. Students didn't converse with one another (for example, you never chatted about your weekend). You only spoke when answering the professor's questions and even then, the professor didn't correct any errors you might have made. This made the harshly graded speaking tests very difficult because you'd had no practice. Also, vocabulary was a nightmare. The words are obscure and you're tested in the worst possible manner. Even if you know every word, the fill-in the blank sentences could use so many other possible words that it makes it almost impossible to try to recall the exact word that you read ONCE. ",
            "\u00a0The tests in this class didnt seem to teach me a lot and would be hard English class. I think it would profit from better oral testing parts that are more fair "

            "\u00a0I mean if you have to take it you have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Take it to fulfill language. It's a lot of work. Very confusing instructions and poorly organized homework assignments. I'm not sure that I actually learned anything.\r\n\r\nIf you're taking it for fun, consider purchasing Rosetta Stone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Probably not just because the tests are so hard. You learn a lot in class but it doesnt translate so much to the tests "
