            "\u00a0I learned many aspects of nonparametric estimation methods, as well as intuitions behind these methods and usage and implementation of these methods with R.  I also gained a general idea on how to select the proper estimation methods based on prior assumptions and properties of the data. ",

Particular topics included density estimation, the bias-variance tradeoff, nonparametric bayesian methods, nonparametric regression, wavelets, cross-validation, the normal means model, Stein shrinkage, high-dimensional graph estimation, and, sparse additive models.  I thought it was great that Prof. Lafferty incorporated a fair amount of relatively recent research into his lectures, and this made the class very interesting. \r\n\r\nOf all the statistics classes I have taken, this is probably the one that expanded my understanding of statistics the most.  Even though I had taken many statistics classes prior to this one, I had never studied nonparametric estimation before, and I think this class really widened my knowledge of different types of statistical models and how to analyze how suitable they are in various settings.

Professor Lafferty is knowledgable and engaging, and the material often isn't covered elsewhere in the department.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are organizational. It was quite a large course for a single TF, and we got very little feedback on homework. ",

Assignments are helpful for gaining a better understanding of the material.  The project is so much fun, and a great way to end the semester by delving deeper into a topic you found interesting.\r\n\r\nAreas of improvement:  It would have been nice to get a little bit more feedback on the assignments.

I loved this class and would definitely recommend it.\r\n\r\nI would just want to add as a caution that the assignments do take a fair amount of time, and it is important to budget the time you are given to complete the assignments wisely.  Expect a minimum of about 20 hours to complete the assignments - each involves lots of programming, lots of LaTeX'ing (if you desire), and lots of math.  I did think the assignments were really fun, and I learned quite a bit from doing them, but would just want to warn anyone who will be taking the class that it would be important to set aside a fair amount of time to devote to it. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite mathematical and it seemed like most of the students were either math, statistics, or computer science ph.d students. The skills that are taught in this course seem much more applicable for academia than for an industry job. If you want skills that are marketable for industry, I would take Susan's class instead. ",
