            "\u00a0Among the fundamental challenges of countering violentextremism in West Africa is understanding the message Boko Haram (BH) and its offshoot ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) deploy to build and sustain their operations.  State governments are often challenged to compete with the BH and ISIS-WAmessage-one that promises power, economic prosperity, spiritual fulfillment, in an environment often marked by considerable disparity, local insecurity and poor governance.  The United Stated Department of State asked for Yale Graduate students assistance to more thoroughly study and understand the BH and ISIS-WA message. \r\n\r\nRather than traditional papers and examinations, the goal and intention of this course is to simulate a consulting engagement. Working for a client, (the United States Department of State). \r\n\r\nOne will be asked to learn a tremendous amount about past and present violent extremist movements and counter messaging theory.

While an abundance of resources is provided, it is up to students to determine what they need in a timely manner. Still, the underlying structure of the class, such as assigned readings and guest speakers, provided an important foundation for better understanding the issues at play. ",
