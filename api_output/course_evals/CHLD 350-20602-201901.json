            "\u00a0This class is more about clinical and family perspectives on Autism. The lecturer changes every week, as does the topic, so there is minimal continuity and the quality of the instruction varies. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about autism and its prevalence in society. Incredible class, very eye- opening and thought- provoking in a lot of ways. ",
            "\u00a0Generally more about the history of autism and how it is a disorder that is variable ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to learn about ASD in a personal way-- by working with people on the spectrum. In the course, you also learn about school systems and governments adapting to help include and foster people with ASD. I also gained a clear understanding of the entire spectrum of autism and how wide ASD really scopes. ",

I learned about various methods of treatment and therapy, the differences between ASD and Asperger syndrome, and also gained a lot of experience interacting with autistic individuals. "

            "\u00a0Not a heavy work load, practicum great and very meaningful.  Wish that the class portion had been more of a discussion based seminar, but it ended up being a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very comprehensive, offering a wide range of topics as described above. Classes were very engaging, and often involved guest speakers who were extremely interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course is definitely the placement. Guest lectures are also very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class is minimal work - one short placement response, a paper proposal, and a 10-20 research paper. That's it. The seminar itself is more like a small, somewhat interactive lecture and the topics change but are overall very interesting. It quickly becomes clear that the readings are optional - they are never discussed in class. What you put in is what you get out - you can take this class with minimal effort and be fine, or you can do the readings and come prepared to be engaged during class. The placements are truly the highlight - they complement the class well and are a really cool and rare opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course. Professor has so much to teach and is a great person to learn from. A lot of great guest speakers and learned about so many different facets of disorders in every aspect of life... a lot of things you dont often think about. ",
            "\u00a0I put medium engagement because with the class itself it's very easy to get behind on readings and the day-to-day things for the class because there are only three assignments (two short papers and the final one), but I was very invested in my placement, which almost everyone will say is the highlight of this course. The placement was hands down the best part of the class for me, I got to know great people at my site to the point where my involvement will most likely extend beyond this semester. The impact the placement has for you is really up to you, but if you let it have a big one, then it can be a fantastic experience. ",
            "\u00a0professor Volkmar is awesome! This class opens your mind to the challenges of ASD ",
            "\u00a0This class allows you to learn about autism and people living with ASD in a personal way which is extremely effective. The actual workload for the class was not very intense which gave us time to really focus on our placements. I though many many guest lectures were a strength. However, I think one weakness of the course is that the seminar seemed very lecture based because of all of the guests. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The placement was the best part of this class!\r\nWeakness: More midsemester feedback would be nice ",
            "\u00a0maybe reading responses would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is interesting and low-stress. Professor Volkmar is the best in the field and his resources are infinite. The practicum is the best part of the class. We get to have interactions with people with Autism, which is the best way to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely the placement. So rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: we did something different each class, Prof. Volkmar is great and clearly an expert in the field. Weaknesses: I think some classes dragged on; it would have been nice to split the seminar into 45 min chunks with two speakers each. I also would have liked to hear more from Prof. Volkmar. ",
            "\u00a0The placement is a great opportunity. Lectures might be more engaging if people didn't have their laptops out. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The speakers that came in every week were experts in their field and were very passionate about their subject.\r\nWeaknesses: There were few assignments or ways of ensuring that we stayed on top of class material. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely interesting and the practicum component is by far the most rewarding part of it. The vast variety of guest speakers brought top-level research and expert perspectives into the room. I just wish I had more time to work with the individuals I met through the practicum. By the end of the semester, I felt like I was starting to form some amazing friendships, but before I knew it, it was time to say goodbye. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class is excellent - so interesting, engaging, and inspiring. The opportunity to do site visits was incredible. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Volkmar is a giant in the field of autism and is one of the most approachable professors at Yale and the experience of the placement are two MUST reasons for taking this class. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn about Autism and wants to help the autism community by volunteering their time each week. I had a great experience volunteering, but it does take up a lot of time. I think that the course gives a really unique experience by allowing Yale students to volunteer as part of their class credit. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The best part of this class is that it maximizes learning outside of the classroom. I loved working at Benhaven and learned more than I could learn solely in a classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is so important that we learn about Autism, especially at a place like Yale, where disability is rarely talked about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Absolutely take this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class; it's interesting and has a low workload (though you will have to put time in to write a good final paper). The placement is also a great aspect of the class, and it was nice to work with the same student for a whole semester. However, be aware that this class focuses almost exclusively on autism (and not \"related disorders\"). ",
            "\u00a0Yes the practicum especially was amazing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great course that gives you an amazing hands on volunteering opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student who is looking to learn more about the multi-faceted nature of autism. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about mental disabilities, neuroscience, or psychology. People who have siblings/family members with autism are almost guaranteed a spot, and even if you're an underclassmen, you still have a good shot of getting in. I would even recommend the course just because of my experience with the practicum. "
