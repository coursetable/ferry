After this class, I specifically go looking for the results section so that I can find the places where the authors messed up or tried to cover up something from the readers. That is how much I've learnt in this class. We covered everything from p-values to fixed effects to homoskedasticity. Nothing makes sense in the beginning, and then it does.

I am not joking when I say that after this point, I began seeing regression tables everywhere-- in my Political Science courses, science courses, random articles, etc. The stuff you learn in this class is so, so applicable and even though some of it can be tricky and complicated, the learning is facilitated by 1) JT and his willingness to answer even the silliest of questions and 2) knowing that all of this will pay off in the future.

            "\u00a0JT is literally the strength of this course. I am terrified of math/statistics, but he has a particular skill at taking complex statistical knowledge and breaking it down so that students not only understand it, but understand it fully. He never moves through material too quickly and makes himself readily open to sitting down with students 1-on-1 in office hours, and is the kindest professor I have ever had/probably will ever have. The material is straightforward, makes sense, and is actually applicable. \r\n\r\nI do wish that problem sets would've been returned more immediately so that we could learn from past mistakes, I've done the last 3 psets without knowing if I got similar questions wrong throughout all 3. Having that feedback would've been really helpful. ",

            "\u00a0The Problem sets could be dealt out earlier ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: JT needs to be a bit more organized in terms of posting things when he says he will, being more available to meet with students, being a bit more clear of what will be on exams. Also, grading just needs to be done faster on problem sets and the grade scale needs to be available for everything!\r\n\r\nStrengths: JT is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were everything.\r\nThe only weakness was that I felt like we often fell behind in the material and then just never ended up catching up. Given how important the material is, I thought it would've been really helpful if we could've actually gone through all of it (i.e. actually making the make-up lectures into lectures instead of review sessions). ",
            "\u00a0Could be better organized with continuity between section and lecture ",
            "\u00a0A huge weakness of this course is that to incentivize students to attend class, JT wouldnt post answers to questions on slides. However he wouldnt say no and give clear answers so I often felt like I never knew the exact analysis to give on Psets or exams. And grading would be harsh if you didnt answer a pset question correctly ",
            "\u00a0Could have learned more material, and had a makeup lecture that for missed course, but JT makes material so accesible ",
            "\u00a0A little disorganized as it being the first time JT taught the course. But overall engaging and useful ",
            "\u00a0JT  was very unorganized this semester and the students felt the impact at times ",
            "\u00a0Some of the expectations of the course were not well explained, but this was probably because it was the first time it was taught. This could be improved by making office hours schedule clearer, standardizing the problem set schedule, and making sure all students receive their work back before the final exam. This would allow students to identify mistakes earlier before repeating them. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: teaches you more about STATA and what things to consider in terms of running regressions.\r\nThings to be improved: not much theory/math/etc. you will learn what you need to do when using this for a job, but you won't really know the math behind why you do it (unlike in GLBL 121) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well taught, important info\r\nWeaknesses: very disorganized at times probably because it was the first time it was taught ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Emphasizes interpretation aspects of data, Professor Thomas makes sure to allow for plenty of questions, and the use of Stata.\r\nWeaknesses: Papers over some of the math a little too much sometimes, class can move slowly at times, and the TA's are terrible graders. No context for deductions, just comments on points deducted without any clue as to the correct answer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pacing of course is flexible (if a lot of people don't understand a certain topic, we will spend more time on it), great professor, great TAs, awesome class\r\n\r\nWeakness: pset grade turnaround can be a bit slow ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was definitely Professor Thomas, who helped break down the complex ideas to fairly intelligible fundamental concepts. Without his help I definitely could have gotten lost in the weeds especially towards the end of the semester. Additionally, I greatly appreciated the focus on policy-relevant issues which helped to make the class resonate with me to a greater extent than if we had merely discussed the theories and principles in the abstract. One area for improvement would be regarding feedback, especially on problem sets. This. was often delayed and meant that I sometimes would repeat mistakes without knowing because I had not received comments by the time the next problem set was due. ",
            "\u00a0JT is a really good lecturer but I wish there was more feedback from the TFs. We did not get our pset grades back for a while so it was hard to know how we were doing ",
            "\u00a0Great class! As usual, JT is a gem as a teacher and a person. The TFs were bad this semester though. It seemed like they didn't really understand what was going on -- at times they would answer questions incorrectly or in ways that contradicted lecture. Their sections were all but useless. Their grading was about what a robot given the answer key would do. ",
            "\u00a0JT cares a lot and makes you feel incredibly comfortable asking any question you might have. However, this was the first time the course was offered, and he was clearly figuring a lot of it out as we went along -- there were only a total of six psets in the course and they were almost never posted when he announced they would be, and even with only six psets the content began to feel extremely repetitive (expect to interpret the coefficients in regression output over and over and over again). The grading is also weak -- critiques on psets are never incredibly clear, and it is hard to get ahold of JT and TA's outside of class/section to clarify why points were taken off. ",
            "\u00a0Wished we had gotten through more material. There was a lot of exciting material on the syllabus that we didn't end up getting to, and I wish the course was paced better o that we would have been able to get to that material. Wished we had gotten more clear feedback -- problem sets and exams were returned very late, making it difficult to prepare for subsequent exams and assignments. I greatly dislike Stata, although I doubt that Jackson would change that. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm was very long. Final was less long/more manageable. My biggest issue with the exams in general is that I feel like I'm memorizing answers instead of understanding information at times. Like I can regurgitate an interpretation and pros/cons of a specific method but might not actually understand the reasoning behind why that's the interpretation or why that's a good or bad thing (or how that good or bad thing came to be). Not sure how to fix it, but on exams and PSETs, there were many times when questions would be phrased like \"should we be skeptical of...\" and my gut reaction would be \"yeah, probably\" and then come up with reasons why (when in reality, I probably wouldn't blink an eye at these things, because I'm still trying to process the why's behind the what's that JT teaches)\r\n\r\nOverall, though, taught well by an amazing/hilarious professor! It's my second time with him, and each semester has been a blast! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is the strength of this course. He is a brilliant professor and ensures that everyone has understood the material well. His tests are very fair. The only weakness of this course was that it was a bit disorganised and problem sets were not returned on time (but this is understandable given that this was the first time the class was being taught to Yale College students). ",
            "\u00a0It was not very well organized, and I did not feel like I was being given all the resources to learn the material properly until the last week of the course. I wish we were given back pset grades and comments sooner, as this made improving on future psets more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first year this course was taught, so a lack of foundation and structure made it pretty weak. Professor Thomas knows a lot about the material and is usually a great teacher, but I can tell he did not quite know how much to teach or provide this semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is JT himself. While any stats professor can teach you this material, JT really brings it to life and finds ways in which to make it applicable to the realm of Global Affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is the best part of the class because he is such a good lecturer. I feel like I learned a lot, but I didn't perform well on the exams, and I never found out why because the feedback was absent or unclear. Also, please don't put the class from 11:35-12:50 again. It was so hard to focus because all I could think about was lunch. I actually think I might have performed significantly better if it were at literally any other time! "

Even if you're not interested in math/statistics, this class really helps you build on that knowledge while not being too difficult, and has policy implications that are helpful if you're interested in going into government fields.
