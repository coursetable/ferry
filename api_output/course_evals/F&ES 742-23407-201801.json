            "\u00a0I was able to get a lot of value from this class because of the papers and the discovery profile. The guest speakers were a hit or miss. Some were really good, others not so much. \r\n\r\nI wish we had done pods earlier in the semester and had more pod discussions early on. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked more opportunities to put some of the concepts into practice, rather than sitting and listening to lectures every class.\r\n\r\nUseful material for the most part, though some guest speakers were more valuable and engaging than others.\r\n\r\nMore opportunities for student engagement would be useful, and some way to ensure that students come to class prepared and having done the readings. \r\n\r\nDid a good job bringing in many different guest speakers, but the class overall felt a bit disjointed. I wish we had discussed certain issues, such as gender and race, in more meaningful ways. The unconscious bias class was completely inadequate, and many subsequent speakers didn't address these issues whatsoever. Good class, but needed more framing to come together in a cohesive way. \r\n\r\nAlso, I wish the pods were actually used for something beyond the emergency exercise. Seemed like a lost opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: speakers who bring in lots of wisdom\r\nWeaknesses: some classes/speakers didn't really teach me anything I didn't know\r\n\r\nTo improve, I guess I would think very intentionally and vet every speaker/topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great interaction, diverse speakers, so many different perspectives to work off of when building and managing teams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - there were so many fun activities in the beginning that died out at the end. It would be great for something more interactive, such as the color card game where everyone migrates around the room and shares different cards with people, should continue. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the first unit and the last unit were very helpful and applicable. I think the second unit was less applicable to students who focus on environmental issues. In addition, I didn't think the pods were useful or helpful at all. And then we had to give our podmates feedback at the end but had only really done one activity (the hurricane exercise) together. Also, I think it would make more sense to do reading responses than to do 4 page reflection papers. A person can only talk about their feelings for so long. Finally, are there more opportunities for us to engage with women and people of color? I would also recommend cutting the restaurant case study in unit 2 (that was really not applicable and also kind of sexist). ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure what can be done other than forcing more engagement. This class ended up being a low priority, but I'm not certain of how to fix that. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the class size had been smaller because I think this type of class needs thoughtful discussion throughout it and, while we were able to get that type of discussion sometimes, our discussion time was often relatively short because we had to hear from so many groups. I really enjoyed the course content and wished we had a little more time to discuss each aspect both in our pods and also as a class. I think a smaller class size would have allowed for that. I also feel like many students should take this course and wonder if it could be split into multiple smaller recitations with one large lecture taught on one day and smaller recitations taught by either Brad or Stuart on another. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course itself could be slightly lacking in direction. Prepping the various guest lecturers on sticking to the syllabus or their particular message would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been useful to not have a speaker in each class (though thanks for the effort!!) and have a couple of classes off to be able to reflect collectively in what we have learned. Also this could have helped us assess our classmates with a little bit more insight, since as it stands now it was difficult to assess them. ",
            "\u00a0More engagement with assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0The speakers were by and large (75%) outstanding. The remaining were either not engaging or felt the content they shared was not especially useful. Amy and Valerie were by far my favorite lecturers. \r\n\r\nI thought the hurricane exercise and change management simulation were very useful and insightful. I would have like to have more of that in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the discussions were stopped short and I wish we could have developed it further. Discussions as a large class can be difficult to manage, but the smaller group discussions were often not as engaging. The topics discussed were very open ended and it was sometimes unclear how I should approach them going forward - there was not always a consensus on what the best action would be for a given issue. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teaching team. SOME guest speakers were good, some were really not good. If someone shows an all white male \"team building\" video again I think the entire student body will lose it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was very clear that guest speakers worked to make their sessions engaging and interactive. I found Amy Wrzesniewski and Sarah Biggerstaff particularly engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been useful to work on more simulations or actual team work with our pod. I thought we were going to work a lot more with them, but mainly we were grouped just for discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of the course is that it draws a diverse group of students. I think it has a number of weaknesses. First, there was too much of a business focus. For example, why not have an anthropologist speak to the class? They work with people too, and often in far more challenging settings than a CEO. Farrell was the only sociologist that spoke, and he could have offered a unique perspective on working with people, but instead he gave a very abstract lecture on his research. I would have liked if the class was less theoretical and academic and more about providing students with hands-on experience with working with people. What would this look like? What about working with other students, especially our pod-mates? For example, the most challenging experience I had working with a person was when we did the computer simulation. There was a lot of friction between me and my partner even though that wasn't even the point of the exercise. Working through that friction could have been a really amazing learning experience. My suggestion would be for Foundations of Working with People to think a bit outside the box in terms of pedagogy. For example, maybe each pod could do one of the Escape rooms in Escape New Haven. The students have 1 hour to work together to get out of the room. In my opinion, that would be more valuable than doing the personality test at the beginning of the semester. That would be an incredible learning experience in terms of working with others under a time pressure. ",
            "\u00a0Guest Speakers were all fantastic in sharing their knowledge and insights. The teaching team also really complemented each other. \r\nThe simulations were great and would recommend more of those. ",
            "\u00a0The class would benefit from having a session every few weeks WITHOUT a guest speaker, where students and teaching team could discuss the material and guest lectures. It often didn't feel like a cohesive class because we jumped from one guest to another without any time for considering their talks in unison. I don't think the reflection papers served this purpose very well, and I would have liked to talk about it with my pod or with Brad/Stu/Katie/Ross. ",
            "\u00a0Great guest lecturers! Great teaching team! My main suggestion would be that if you are going to use the pods again next year I suggest doing more actual exercises with them or not use them at all. I also think having each pod provide an answer to different discussion questions can get somewhat repetitive and boring. I would rather have the people that want to speak just raise their hands in class discussions rather than forcing each pod to provide an answer. I think the discussions would be more lively that way. I think it's great to have the pods talk amongst themselves about their thoughts but I don't think every pod needs to report back every time. \r\n\r\nThis course requires a lot of written reflections. These can feel tedious but if you really spend time on them the reflection can be very beneficial, especially as you approach the working world.\r\n\r\nInsights Discovery Profiles are super interesting and helpful! I love thinking more deliberately about what my skills and weaknesses are. \r\n\r\nI think the set up of case studies was a little strange. I preferred when guest lecturers would just come in and give a more traditional lecture about their experiences related to the topic. I think it would also be good to tell some of the lecturers to talk for less time about the specifics of their work and more about how their experiences relate to the given module. ",
            "\u00a0more pod work, less intimidation to speak up in front of large group ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: easy to comprehend, learn, and do; good for knowing oneself and how oneself can fit into a team with others; clearly useful and applicable immediately.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: straightforwardness lends itself to stagnation, class was boring at times. Relevant learning from irrelevant case studies made it harder to take those lessons and apply them to our arenas. ",
            "\u00a0Not enough discussion time after each presenter. ",
            "\u00a0The first two modules were very helpful, but the third was lacking in useful/interesting content. Some of the speakers - Such as Ony and Amy  - were rockstars - and others - like Peter - were less so. Hopefully professors/TAs can screen the speakers next year based on their performance this time around. Another weakness: the exercises seemed to be graded arbitrarily. I put equal amount of effort in to each assignment -submitted my best work each time - never received full points. Was never given an actual explanation as to why I didn't receive full points. (Seems petty, but how are we supposed to know what you're looking for/how to do better, if it isn't made explicit for the entire class?) Discussions of cross-racial interactions were light-touch and unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0Receiving the Discovery Insights profile and feedback from past colleagues, and friends was really helpful. I learned a lot about how others perceived my work and it helped me identify where I could improve myself throughout the semester. One weakness was some of the guest lecturers. Specifically, Rodrigo Canales, who was dismissive towards student comments, and generally abrasive. It was not appreciated that he commanded students stay after class to hear the end of his presentation. It was uncomfortable and he is not an example of someone who is good at working with people. He should not be invited again. A second weakness is that the course only talks about positive examples of working with people and does not spend enough time discussing how to navigate the many challenges of working with people. This is a missed opportunity to use class discussions to talk about real challenges we face and how to address them. The pods could be used to facilitate more group discussion and providing support for specific challenges fellow pod-mates face throughout the course of the semester; particularly, since the pods are a mix of different Insights profile types. ",
            "\u00a0This class should be condensed into a 1.5 or 2 credit course. Again, the first part of the course was great (Amy Wrzesniewski was amazing, especially with her talk about the purpose of work and how we should think about our job and career after FES), the Hurricane exercise was good, some speakers in the latter half like Justin Farrell and Peter Boyd were good. The instructors should review speakers who came this year and cut out the ones that were flat. Also, speakers should talk about the skills that we can take to apply to our own work instead of simply describing their work, which was narrow and not relevant to students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the diversity of speakers that came in to share their expertise on their specific topics. The simulations we did - the hurricane exercise, the organization computer game, etc - were really fun, and really demonstrative of the modules that we did. I really liked the pods concept - getting to work with the same group over a period of time is definitely what we're going to be doing in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The class has many strengths, including the content, the materials, the guest-speakers and the division by pods. Specially the work in pods was beneficial to me because I was not ready to speak in front of the hole class, but I could share my ideas with the members of my team and engaged in class discussions. Also, I really like having the class twice a week. \r\nI would change the time of the class. I am not a morning person, so it was very hard for me to be on time. I would have preferred to have such an enjoyable course later in the day. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are it makes the case that soft skills are the hardest to master and it gives you a space to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and areas where you want to improve and build on. The weakness for me is that the guest speakers could be less familiar with the FES students' backgrounds and provide more background than is necessary, based on our baseline understanding of certain topics. Some speakers gave more relevant and memorable lectures than others. I think the reflections were helpful for us to reflect on what we learned and extract the useful elements of the lectures. It could be improved by asking speakers to minimize background information and re-state the key takeaways at the end of their talks.\r\n\r\nAnother area of improvement that became clear from one lecture in particular was that the readings were not always relevant, so there were times when I would spend time and energy doing the readings, but they were not useful or necessary for lectures, while other times, the readings or videos were critical. Sometimes it's hard as a student to know what to prioritize, when there are so many other competing interests for our time. I think it was very helpful when the TF's would make a Canvas announcement when the readings or videos would be particularly important for in-class discussion, because this helped make sure enough students do the reading to have a functional discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength and weakness: There where many speakers from a wide variety of fields. These allowed us to receive information from different perspectives from people who are experts in their fields. However, the presentations were not very articulated. We reflected on the presentations individually in our papers, which was a way for us to connect them personally. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to have opportunities to reflect about their connections in class. ",
            "\u00a0The first section of this course, which focuses on self awareness and understanding, was by far the best. The Insights Discovery Profile we completed was extremely helpful, and all of the speakers I can remember in that section were fabulous. The teamwork and network sections were a little more hit or miss, but still generally helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great class- too many guest speakers. Liked the exercises a lot more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- the self-reflection exercises we did. The Insights Discovery Profile was my favorite assignment. I learned so much about myself, and I've already used what I learned to help me in interviews. \r\n- many of the guest lectures were fascinating. The course was structured in such a way that the lectures built off the body of knowledge we gained in previous lectures. The teaching team clearly thought a lot about who they wanted to have speak, and they did a great job.\r\n- The teaching team - Brad and Stu work really well together and bring a great energy to the course. Ross and Katie were awesome TAs, and always available to help and answer questions.\r\n- the readings were usually really interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The lecture by Rodrigo from SOM was not my favorite (not a class fan favorite either) "

            "\u00a0Definitely taking this course before you graduate!!! ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class, useful material to think about when preparing to enter the workplace. Less work required than other FES classes, and a different kind of work with personal reflections rather than research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Come up with a list of goals you wish to achieve in your professional and even personal relationships. There is a good chance those things will be covered. If you feel like the material does not address your needs, tell Stu or Brad immediately. They are great with course flexibility so that students get the most of the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a great course, but the opportunity to apply the lessons learned really falls on you. I would also consider it a good \"balancing class\" because it definitely uses a different part of your brain than FES science or \"Technical\" courses. ",
            "\u00a0Might be more of a final semester course. I would only suggest taking if you've had real problems working in groups or are interested in a career in facilitating or management design problem solving. Otherwise, you can probably spend use credits better elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides several templates and real world examples for how to work with people which is an essential skill that any environmental manager will need to know how to do. Brad and Stuart do a wonderful job bringing in guest lecturers with many different backgrounds and provide a great deal of insight from their own lives. This is a very worthwhile course! ",

            "\u00a0Best to take in your last semester! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The lectures are interesting and it provides you with dedicated time to step back and think about how you work with people and what your strengths and weaknesses are. This course was a nice reprieve from classes focused on environmental topics. ",
            "\u00a0The way this course was structured made it an easy and sometimes enjoyable course. I would take it only if you are looking to lighten your workload. Occasionally, there are some really cool speakers. Other times, the speakers are mediocre. I wouldn't go out of your way to take the course. ",

            "\u00a0This is a good class to have in the final semester when you are busy with recruiting and interviewing. The class covers some important soft skills and will give you insight into your working styles, strengths and weaknesses. I did not have time to do the reading but you will learn more if you do the reading. ",

            "\u00a0People definitely slack on this class. If you're going to get the most out of it I recommend doing the readings, going to class, and taking the time to think about speakers etc. Otherwise it's not worth it! ",
            "\u00a0great class ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course, and unique at FES. The focus on the \"soft skills\" isn't something we get a lot of at FES, but I would argue that for people at a professional school, it's a critical skill set to acquire. We should value people skills equally to quantitative science. As environmental managers, working with teams of people is going to be our career reality, and we need to be prepared for the diversity and challenges working in teams poses. \r\n\r\nI was warned before I took the class not to forget about the readings, and I wish I had heeded this advice. I started out very strong in the beginning of the semester. I completed each reading and did it well, but after spring break, that really took a nosedive. It's easy not to do them because you aren't held accountable for it in class, but they really do augment the quality of the course and help you in your learning. Do them! ",
