            "\u00a0I gained a ton of practical experience with the whole data science process from scraping data to organize and exploring it to analyzing it. My skills in R improved a lot, and I became particularly well equipped with scrapping methods and the process of exploring and cleaning data. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I learned to work with and analyze real data. We learned techniques for data gathering and processing, such as web scraping and using regular expressions in R, and gained lots of practice cleaning complex data sets. I also learned the importance of checking data and realizing how different ways of processing data can yield different results. The final project was a great opportunity to do a full-length analysis from start to finish, with substantial support and feedback from the professor and teaching fellow. My coding skills also improved drastically in this class, and I really appreciated the detailed coding feedback that was provided in this class. We also took a bit of time to learn a bit about data visualization, which was another great topic that I had not previously studied in great detail. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to actually work with real data, from data collection (scraping from the website, using APIs, etc.) to statistical analyses. The project component was also a good opportunity to practice \"independent research.\" ",
            "\u00a0Scraping! And several nice R techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped me better understand data collection, scraping, cleaning, and presentation. It was the most helpful of the stats classes I've taken at Yale, and it gave me opportunities to apply what I had learned in previous classes in a more tangible way through analyses, reports, and presentations. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think a little more structure to the course would be helpful. I think a bit of review and discussion of the different techniques that could be used for each dataset would have been better. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a great course overall-- it is a lower stress alternative to a senior project where you can still learn a bunch of useful techniques and apply methods that were taught in previous Yale courses. I would say a major strength of this class is the instructor Susan, who is both very helpful and encouraging in guiding us on our in-class projects. I also like how many of the assignments are group work. It was a lot of fun to have a chance to work closely with other S&DS majors.\r\n\r\nI think the one weakness of the course is the grading. While the instructor and the TF clearly looked closely and gave helpful comments on our assignment submissions, I would have appreciated seeing a numerical score or a letter grade on our assignments. While the comments were helpful in getting specific pieces of feedback, I think it would have helped to know whether my assignments were done well or poorly. Also, I think the syllabus should have stated what percentage of the grade is based on the final project and what percentage of the grade is based on the weekly assignments to give students a better understanding of how much time they should be spending on their final projects versus on the regular coursework. ",
            "\u00a0This course is exactly what a capstone course in S&DS major should look like. It was challenging, but manageable in terms of workload, and provided students with the opportunity for guided exploration: we had substantial flexibility to investigate what interested us in each data set, but Professor Wang and Molly (the teaching fellow) were always there to provide feedback and guidance. The biggest strengths of this course are twofold. The first was the quality of instruction and the small size of the class. Both Professor Wang and Molly were outstanding teachers and were able to provide detailed, individualized feedback (no doubt in part because the class is capped at roughly 20). Second, this course filled numerous gaps in my statistics knowledge and provided me with many useful skills for analyzing, gathering, and presenting real data (such as web scraping or using ggplot to make nice graphics). The only weakness (and this is really quite slight) is that the workload was a bit uneven. There were a couple of weeks with little work assigned, and others where a significant project would be assigned on Tuesday, due on Thursday. This just made planning a bit difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Susan is an extremely organized, supportive, understanding, and kind. She provided so much help and guidance throughout the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class had not been offered 9am in the morning. It was too early for me (and I think other students) to be hands-on working productively during class time. ",
            "\u00a0The datasets we used were quite interesting, but I think there might be room to have an exam on important statistical concepts that students should have a grasp on. I feel like if we had memorized R commands and a lot of the statistical concepts early on and were tested on it, we would have had more opportunities to apply and refine our skills. ",
            "\u00a0Susan can make any course amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Best professor in the stats department. Great structure allowing us to work with multiple other students in a smaller class size. Able to engage with multiple types of analysis and skills. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes there was suddenly a lot of unexpected work when a final group report was due on Thursday morning after being assigned Tuesday. Also it was often unclear what the actual expectations of the course were since there were no grades given along the way (although there was good feedback from Susan and Molly). "

            "\u00a0I thought this was a fun project-based course where you learn a lot. It is nice to have a class where we are required to work in groups during class and the teacher is walking around the room offering help and insight to each group. I think whether or not you should take this class depends on what you want to get out of your senior requirement for S&DS. If you have a specific research area you want to work on or a specific S&DS professor you want to work with you should probably opt to do a senior project. If you want a less-stressful option, where you work less deeply on a wider variety of projects, you should take this course instead. ",
            "\u00a0I wholeheartedly recommend this class if taught by Professor Wang. For either S&DS or non-S&DS majors, this class is an excellent opportunity to work with complex, real data sets and get practice doing data analysis projects from start (i.e., gathering data) to finish (i.e., producing finished reports). Professor Wang picked a set of extremely interesting data sets and data sources to work with and gave students the flexibility to find interesting things to investigate in each. Furthermore, Professor Wang provides great feedback and I felt that my coding and statistics knowledge grew substantially through taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone who'd like to have more solid, practical skills in data analysis. It is also a great alternative to senior thesis or project class. The way I think about it is you have more flexibility in choosing the data set and the direction you want to push the project through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially because it is an option to fulfill the senior requirement in S&DS. ",
            "\u00a0Sure. It's less work than doing a thesis and you get much more structured guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this and don't do a thesis.  Susan is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100%. I took this for senior capstone credit, and it was such a great decision. Although I kind of regret not having a final thesis as the summation of my work in college, I'm glad I was able to combine this more survey style group-oriented class with a final individual project that pushed me in a lot of new ways and exposed me to new ideas for analysis and presentation of data and findings. It was definitely my favorite stats class at Yale and Susan is the best stats professor I've had, so it was always a joy to go to, even at 9am on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This was the first year they offered this as a capstone option for the S&DS major and I think they did a great job with it. I have so many great things to say about Susan, she is really one of my favorite professors at Yale! She organized this class quite well and workload was very manageable and class work was very engaging! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great class and very practical. "
