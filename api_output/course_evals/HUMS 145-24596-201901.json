            "\u00a0We read most of the major Greek and Latin novels, along with a lot of modern literary criticism. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-English/Comp Lit major or DS survivor, I had never received an introduction to textual analysis or criticism. This course was invaluable in providing this introduction through weekly \"Foundation\" readings. I improved my close readings abilities, but more importantly, I stopped thinking of my papers as in vacuums and started to become aware of the greater body of thought around ancient texts that I can employ for my own use. My prose became more polished, and I also became better at skimming readings for their gist (because boy, there are many pages of readings per week). ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the foundational ancient Greek and Roman novels, the predecessors to the modern novel.  We mostly focused on the themes found within and between the novels, as well as the literary theory that is based upon them. While I had studied many aspects of ancient Greek and Roman societies beforehand, this course was useful in providing in-depth discussions of their prose literature. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I developed a familiarity with the corpus of extant ancient novels, as well as with the late-imperial cultural context in which they (apparently) circulated. Alongside this content, the course offered a significant selection of literary theory from Bakhtin and Genette to Fanon and Lessing -- critical reading tools that are applicable far beyond the genre of ancient novels. Professor LeVen also turned this course into excellent writing instruction: the three short papers offered good chances to review and develop my skills in different types of analysis, feeding neatly into a longer final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0On the broadest level, I learned to be a much better reader. That's not the case with lots of classes, which often build knowledge in an area of literature or practice exercising reading/writing/discussion skills. The excellent syllabus, including theory and secondary scholarship in addition to the ancient novels, definitely facilitated this. It's hard to name all the elements that contribute to this, but when I started the class, I knew I was in \"good hands\" with Professor LeVen, whose discussion leading, knowledge, and enthusiasm helped us explore abstract and structural literary concepts within the novels in a way that felt grounded and specific to the works. This semester has made me a better reader of both novels and theory (and the two in combination), which I will carry with me into reading, writing and conversing in various areas. Ancient Novels gave me an opportunity to consider the specific ancient works and their cultural contexts, the genre of the novel, how one applies 19th/20th/21st century theory to ancient texts, and how to discuss and write about all of that.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor LeVen is very nice, excited about the material, and knowledgeable.  She is good at keeping discussion moving even when people don't have much to say.  Workload is very manageable, and the primary source readings were enjoyable.   We read a lot of historically important works of literary criticism that aren't really taught anywhere else at Yale, so it was good to be exposed to that.\r\nWeaknesses: The fusion of Classical literature and modern literary criticism sometimes fell flat.  In class, we would spend about half of the time discussing each.  Also, some of the literary criticism was too theoretical for us really to understand it when we were going so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class. It's fully one of the best I've taken at Yale. Prof. LeVen has put so much thought into the layout of the course, the works tackled and the pairings of source and secondary materials that all of my criticism is minor. I did not love having to print out dozens of pages of the secondary readings each week (but I do think the no computer policy really helped our class discussion). In total, though, this was a near-perfect course due in part to the planning and readings, but mainly the class discussions. Everyone came into discussions with different opinions on the readings and different experiences that all contributed productively. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strengths of this course were the foundational articles that were meant to supplement the core readings.  These articles, such as Kristeva on intertextuality, are truly foundational critical analyses that have many more applications outside of ancient novels. In my opinion, they should be emphasized and read more in other humanities classes (and it is a shame that I am only coming across them now). I am forever thankful that Professor LeVen introduced me to these influential works.  On the other hand, the greatest weakness of this course was its heavy reading load. This, in combination with the small sections of the novel we actually discussed in class, made it very discouraging to finish all of the readings.  I understand that due to the nature of this course, it is very hard to reduce the amount of weekly reading.  But perhaps discussing more of the reading in class, or pointing out beforehand the sections that will be imperative for class discussion, would help in this regard. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of this course is its heavy emphasis on literary theory. I was excited that we gave ample seminar time to each week's critical selection -- and, given Professor LeVen's careful alignment of these selections with our readings in the ancient novels, the two segments of our discussions were almost invariably mutually supporting. I also appreciated the course's concurrent reading of Achilles Tatius, Longus, and Heliodorus, which both exposed generic conventions and highlighted the differences between these three key novels. Professor LeVen's comprehensive seminar plans and thoughtful syllabus design set us up for an excellent semester.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improving this course would be to limit the portfolio assignment. I found the portfolio immensely helpful for the Greek novels -- given that we were reading several novels at once, it was a useful exercise to master the plot points, and I found myself referencing my portfolio frequently as I worked on papers later in the semester. Since we discussed each foundational reading individually and in-depth, I felt that those portfolio summaries and reflections were not as essential to my learning in the course; similarly, the later weeks of the course -- in which we were reading only one novel at a time! -- left plot points fresher in my memory. Given that the course has a heavy reading and writing load beyond this assignment, I would suggest limiting the portfolio to just the Greek novels. ",
            "\u00a0I can't really think about how it can be improved, except for the course not to end. That sentiment means that the approach of the course excellently models how to approach reading/writing/learning in a consistently exciting and sustaining way. After many courses I say \"I learned about x, y, and z,\" and this course taught me both about its content and how to approach learning in the future. \r\n\r\nI think portfolios were helpful when we were reading several novels at once, and for outlining the foundation articles, but became unnecessary when reading Apuleius and Lucian.

            "\u00a0This course is good as a fifth class, especially if you wish you spent more time reading novels for pleasure.  The literary theory can be challenging and sometimes frustrating if you're not used to it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Even though it is tangential at best to my major, I enjoyed it immensely and got so much out of it that will no doubt carry over to my writing and my thinking. I will say that it was very clear who consistently did the readings and who did not, and it showed in ability (and inability) to contribute to in-class discussions. This isn't a Cr/D course  if you put in the work, you'll do well, and you wouldn't get as much out of it if you didn't do the work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student only if they are truly interested in the ancient novels.   The foundational articles (meant to supplement the novels) are incredibly interesting and are easily applicable in future courses.  Professor LeVen is also absolutely fantastic, and is also a plethora of knowledge regarding this subject (you will get to learn so much from her and she breathes life into the novels). On the other hand, the novels themselves are very long, with winding and convoluted plots so that they tend to become a bit repetitive over the course of the semester.  So if you're willing to read the novels in exchange for a fantastic professor, take the course. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this class if you are interested in reading ancient literature -- but also if you are just interested in reading at all. It shouldn't come as a surprise that the Roman Empire had campy romance novels with pirates and prophecies, but somehow it does -- at least, it did to me -- and I was constantly excited to read these odd, fascinating, and enjoyable ancient texts. This course also offers an excellent (and, in my experience, unparalleled) opportunity to read significant selections of literary theory. Each week, it felt as though I was finally adding a new and crucial gadget to my reading toolkit. Professor LeVen is a wonderful teacher, and my reading and writing skills benefited immensely from her seminar leading, paper comments, and office-hours discussions. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0If you like reading fiction, take this class: it will make you a better reader for the rest of your life. If you like classics and the ancient world, take this class: it will teach you how to think about literature in its ancient context and in terms of modern theorizations of literature. If you want to learn about literary theory, take this class as it will teach you how to approach the foundation articles with an eye to a specific corpus (or is it a cohesive corpus?--the class will address this too). Do not worry about your level of exposures to classics--our class included a classics major on one end, and someone with little experience in classics on the other, and both contributed in excellent ways to our discussions. \r\n\r\nIf you look at the syllabus, it has a substantial amount of work. The readings, however, are quite manageable and pay off in learning and discussion. Additionally, the shorter papers (one an examination of two secondary articles, one a close reading, and the third a short exploration of a motivating question for the final paper) are clear exercises in reading and writing. Professor LeVen was immensely helpful in both the early stages of paper-writing and in her comments on my writing, so I learned a lot with each assignment. \r\n\r\nEvery class meeting was a joy because of Professor LeVen's enthusiasm for the material and for teaching.
