            "\u00a0- It really improved my math abilities and critical thinking. I got exponentially better at figuring out tricky problems and solving them quickly. \r\n- I gained a keen understanding of different market structures and firm strategies. \r\n- I learned models of AI and how it'll impact the economy. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting and fairly chill Econ seminar. As far as the Econ theory of the class, we mostly focused on innovation. But we got the AI bit through student presentations. Basically, the class is a midterm and no final, with a few weekly problem sets that aren't too bad. The level of the problem sets is somewhere between intro and intermediate micro. After the midterm, everyone gives a presentation on a topic of their choice related to innovation/AI, and it was honestly pretty cool hearing about the ways AI is being implemented in various industries (automated driving like Uber/Lyft, pharmaceutical companies, airline industry, online auctions, etc.). If you're interested in AI/innovation, or just looking for a chill but interesting Econ seminar, I highly recommend this one. ",
            "\u00a0We learned many different economic models that are relevant to innovation. Examples include competition in quantities and prices, leader follower, r&d, patents, etc. ",
            "\u00a0none ",
            "\u00a0Learned the economics of competition between firms, patents, and general innovation. From the student presentations I learned about artificial intelligence and innovation in different industries. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, I learned more about how markets operate in various situations, from monopolies to dominant/fringe dynamics, along with the implications of game theory in how companies move and innovate over time. In addition, we learned about the implications of innovation and artificial intelligence in these markets, both quantitatively and through student presentations. While Prof. Chalioti's presentations focused more about the economic modeling and strategies for interpreting these markets, the student presentations brought to life the numerous market applications for artificial intelligence, innovation, and the legal issues surrounding their implementation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how artificial intelligence is becoming a part of almost every industry (social media, sports, ride sharing, finance, etc). I also learned how to model AI and innovation economically. ",
            "\u00a0Good advanced micro course ",
            "\u00a0Theoretical knowledge of how to model firm behavior in situations involving innovation, patents, and technology. More specific real world knowledge about several industries involving artificial intelligence. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of market structures, what drives innovation, and some of the big trends in the technology sector today ",
            "\u00a0Very little about AI.  Lots about innovation and economic models behind it. ",
            "\u00a0The course is built on the foundation of Econ 121. It further enriches understanding of microeconomic theory with applications in tech industries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the theory behind technological advancements such as patents and licensing. Something I didn't expect to learn more about was industrial organization; most of the first half of the class revolved around applying the different market structures. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0- I think there needs to be at least more mention of AI throughout the course. In the beginning we (understandably) spent a lot of time working through theoretical models but never talked about AI. \r\n- Halfway through the course, we started to learn about AI and this is when it got much more interesting for me. ",
            "\u00a0Its perfect! Professor Chalioti organizes classes really well. Theres lots of interesting material, the homework makes sure you know it, and you always know what to expect on exams. The presentation is fun and a good way to learn more about a topic youre interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I did not expect to have as many problem sets as we did. The seminar was not very conducive to discussion, and many of the lectures were boring. Others were very interesting, such as when we got to try virtual reality. I enjoyed the presentations given in the second half of the class - it was fun to learn from classmates. However, the course was advertised as something it was not. We did not learn much about AI and mostly just learning about intellectual property. I can't say I know too much about the market for AI now. ",
            "\u00a0This course did better than others at integrating both the professor's lectures and student presentations. Overall, the first six seminars were Prof. Chalioti's lectures, followed by classes which were mostly student presentations and approximately 15-20 of Chalioti's lecture (after the midterm, post-October break). I thought this was a good mix since the student presentations were very interesting, but I had hoped to see more done in the way of economic models involving AI, potentially including some of her research. However, that may just be a fault of the field being so new and so indefinite. Class structure was pretty manageable, with six problem sets and a 15-20 minute presentation. The report at the end of the course was not unreasonable, but I had wished that she had clarified its length farther in advance (as it was moved from an implied double-spaced length to single-spaced). ",
            "\u00a0The course is great at touching on many aspects of artificial intelligence and its effect on the economy. The exams and problem sets were fair and covered exercises we went over in class. We even got to try out virtual reality in the CTL. It is a seminar, but is taught lecture style in addition to student presentations. I wouldve appreciated some more in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Didnt learn much about AI ",
            "\u00a0The class seemed split between a theoretical learning of incentives to innovate and an attempt to get at a real world understanding of how artificial intelligence will interact with the economy. The class might be better served to focus specifically on real world applications and learning about artificial intelligence itself. ",
            "\u00a0Not a great emphasis on the econ of AI, but otherwise a very well taught and structured class that teaches you about innovation and market structures ",
            "\u00a0Very well explained models. Well prepared teaching and great professor.  Unfortunately the course didn't really talk about AI much. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Was a wonderful survey course of how AI technology is used today, the intricacies of patents/IP, and the economics of such technology. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I got frustrated at times with how much meaningless math was on the psets but I am very happy that I took it, overall. You learn a lot and really improve your critical thinking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Chalioti organizes classes really well. Theres lots of interesting material, the homework makes sure you know it, and you always know what to expect on exams. The presentation is fun and a good way to learn more about a topic youre interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably pick a different senior seminar. However, it was the first time the course was taught, so I'm sure Eva is eager to make improvements/adjustments. Just know you will have to do problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed this course. Problem sets were reasonable and Professor Chalioti teaches in a very coherent manner.  Although I was a little skeptical at first with regards to student presentations making up almost the entirety of the second half of the class, I did learn a lot from these presentations and Professor Chalioti tied them to economic concepts we had learned in class. Overall, if you are interested in technology, AI, and innovation, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in market innovation and how markets act in today's world, I think that this course is great. It doesn't do as much in the way of specifics regarding AI, but it does bring into perspective how artificial intelligence is going to change markets, and how innovation over history has already changed markets. Plus, the project and report is a great opportunity to explore a topic that you find interesting in the field, especially if you aren't doing a thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if youre interested in learning about how AI and innovation is changing almost every industry and the economy in general. This course is at the cutting edge of modern economics. The course is a good balance of quantitative and qualitative material, and the quantitative material is the right amount of challenge. The workload is very reasonable: 6 problem sets that arent too long, a midterm exam, and a presentation and 7-10 page (note: single-spaced) paper on a topic of choice. The problem sets and midterm exam in this class cover almost the same economics material as Economics of New Technology (also taught by Professor Chalioti). However, I would recommend Econ of AI since it is a smaller class that only meets once a week, and you write a final paper instead of a final exam (which you have to do in Econ of New Technology). If you have taken Intermediate Micro with Professor Chalioti before, know that taking a class with her in a smaller setting is a very different experience and she cares a lot about her students doing well. ",
            "\u00a0No because we didnt learn about AI ",
            "\u00a0It depends. This is a decent seminar in that it is a relatively interesting subject, but unfortunately there is not a deep exploration of actual artificial intelligence beyond your own individual project. That being said, Chalioti is wonderful and makes sure that the class is very fair and not unnecessarily taxing from a workload perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This is not a course on AI it is a course on innovation and tech.  It is a good course on innovation and tech that is well designed with a good explanation of the models, but it doesn't really cover AI at all.  That said, Eva is smart, nice and well prepared. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for anyone who is interested in the theoretical side of AI and technology. "
