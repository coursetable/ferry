            "\u00a0My critical thinking skills definitely were elevated by this course. Additionally, I feel much more confident in my writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the Freud and Foucault texts we read, which were very interesting, as well as a generally better understanding of historical perspectives on sexuality. (Be warned, this class really is about the HISTORY of sexuality. It's a lot of historical texts and a few weeks of archival research). I also learned to question truths in a way that I hadn't before  you figure out very quickly that science is often flawed and nothing is an objective fact. That, I think, is something that bleeds over into life in general. ",
            "\u00a0This class dramatically changed how I understand and interact with the systems that produce knowledge. Sexuality was just a vantage point to examine the weight societies give to science in describing reality. ",
            "\u00a0I became so much more comfortable talking about sexuality, which is an incredibly positive change in my opinion. This course got me acquainted with not only a whole new niche of knowledge but it also taught me a completely new way of learning. I gained skills in critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to speak about sexuality in an academic setting ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to question sources and identify biases in writing. I also learned how to do archival research and engage with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read primary sources critically. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my mind to how knowledge production works in our society and how complicated the discussion around sexuality has always been. ",
            "\u00a0What knowledge, skills, and insights didn't I develop by taking this course? This class blew my mind. I have a totally different understanding of sexuality. Our study of Foucault in this class taught me that sexuality is all about economics and politics. Once you understand that you will realize that all labels and constrictions on sexuality are so fickle. I also learned how to do archival work and set up a question for a research paper. Additionally, Professor Trumpler gives these really helpful handouts on how to write a good opening sentence, thesis statement, topic sentence, conclusion, etc. and different stages of editing. They are so useful. Also I learned the advantages of using the first person in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is not so much a class about teaching you the explicit definition about different terms concerned with sexuality, but more about gaining a framework for viewing and questioning the world around. I will definitely continue thinking about some of the things we discussed into the future especially regarding the assumptions made by science. ",
            "\u00a0While sexuality is highly relevant in all people's daily lives, it is rarely openly discussed-- the class allowed to me to understand how sexuality and identity was relevant in our daily lives. It also caused me to start questioning everything we as a society consider \"normal\", from monogamy to the scientific facts within our textbooks as well as power structures developed within relationships. ",
            "\u00a0I learned theory surrounding sexuality from the 1800s to 1900s and how to argue an archival paper. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of different perspectives and theories of sexuality throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0This class really truly taught me how to think differently about our society. While I learned a lot of specifics regarding the history of sexuality, I came out of the class evaluating power structures in any capacity. I feel like I now have the ability to be truly critical of what has been normalized. ",
            "\u00a0An increased ability to read scientific and theoretical texts from a critical WGSS perspective, and an understanding of the basic scientific literature on the nature of human sexuality in the west from the late 19th century to the present. I also gained some fascinating perspective about the joys and frustrations of archival work. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to do a lot of reading in a short amount of time. I also became more knowledgeable in writing in a more assertive voice (using first person) and developed knowledge about the discourse on sexuality in western society from the late 18th Century to present. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Trumpler is wonderful and truly cares about her students. The class is organized thoughtfully and the order of the readings in the syllabus truly make sense once you get to the end of the course. It all comes together so well.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the course readings are dry and dense. The majority, however, are fun to read and discuss. ",
            "\u00a0This class, being a seminar, really depends on who's in it. I think that a lot of times our discussions stalled or were just lacking in insight because people kept repeating the same thing over and over again, but not sure if that was because of the people themselves or a lack of material to analyze in the sources that we read. A lot of what we read felt very obvious and difficult to analyze; like, 'oh, in the 19th century they hated gay people. What a surprise.' But I think in cases like these, where discussion gets stuck, Professor Trumpler could have chimed in, which she doesn't necessarily do often enough. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was extremely strong. It's chronological order was helpful in creating a coherent narrative for a history of \"Western\" sexuality, and ending with a contemporary scholar whom we actually were able to meet was very powerful. I might say that a weakness of the course was a tendency for the room to become quiet on weeks with more difficult reading. ",
            "\u00a0I really did not feel that there were any weaknesses in the course. I was a huge fan of our discussions and felt that the readings were thoughtfully chosen and every part of the class had a purpose. ",
            "\u00a0There are lots of dense readings that were often difficult to read without an early introduction. Maybe introducing and prefacing the readings would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0S: welcomes students of all backgrounds and previous experience levels\r\nS: demystifies the ideas of sexuality\r\nW: discussions were often a call and response from student to professor- we were called on in class as opposed to having a student idea driven format. I would have preferred that the class shift to a more student oriented format later in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it offered a very different perspective on the hist of human sexuality. It took a very individual focus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super interesting readings, great discussions, interesting paper topics\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the reading assignments are a bit long, but the topics in them as well as the discussion about them usually make up for it ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Trumpler. She's an incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and invested professor. Everything that we read is so fascinating and will change the way you think about sexuality but also just life in general. You actually want to write the papers in this class. I have never experienced that before, and this class made me feel like writing wasn't just a task but an opportunity for me to showcase my knowledge.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is too short. I wish I could have stayed in it for a year. Also my friends will never get to take it because it's a first-year seminar.\r\n\r\nImprovements: None. This class is amazing. Please take it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was well structured in terms of the chronology of our readings and class discussion-- I wish that we did more of teh smaller-group discussions to become more engaged with the materials and our peers. I also wished we had more controversial debates in terms of viewing sexuality within the contemporary era as well as in other cultures. ",
            "\u00a0The course really does offer a comprehensive overview of sexuality and fosters great discussion over the material. No notable weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the content, the seminar setting, and the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Trumpler has a great deal of expertise and has been teaching this course for over twenty years. If you enjoy reading scientific work, anthropological work, Freud, or Foucault, this class definitely has something for you. This course is also a first year seminar, and has all of the attendant strengths and weaknesses of a course where all of the students are in their first year at college. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was its openness to dialogue between  students. A weakness is that it can get a little boring at times throughout the course depending on what the reading is. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you're looking to take a first year seminar and you're interested in science and/or sexuality, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0It's an easy writing or humanities credit, which is always good. It's an interesting class, but also a lot of times very dull with kinda boring readings. I found myself dreading it a lot of the time. But the archival research that we did was fascinating and a skill that I'm really glad I learned my freshman year, so that is something to keep in mind as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a few different categories of students. First, those who are interested in taking a first WGSS class would benefit from the fact that it will be many of the students' first WGSS class. Second, those who tend to reside in the humanities but enjoy critically engaging with theory will enjoy the lens through which Professor Trumpler presents the material. And third, those who plan to dedicate their lives to research in any STEM discipline should feel a sense of obligation to take this course. The History of Sexuality was my first exposure to science and technology studies and it has immensely changed how I understand scientific knowledge production. My understanding is that there are few other classes in Yale College that approach STS, so I'd strongly encourage STEM-oriented first-years to opt for this First-year Seminar. Just do it - it's a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone and everyone. It is called the history of sexuality but it is SO much more than that. Sure, I learned lots of new information, but my most valuable takeaway was a fresh mindset. I learned how to learn. Maria Trumpler uses the history of sexuality to teach about knowledge itself. It was a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely changed my perspective on human sexuality and its discourse for the better. The discussions we had are essential for anyone regardless of your career prospects! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was really helpful to take a course with subject matter so deeply involved in my every day life. I think it should be required to take a course involving some kind of the study of sexuality, and I think everyone would benefit from this foundational knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0It depends what you are looking for. If you are look for a traditional history course, this will not provide that. Rather, it provides a very different perspective on the treatment of human sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would! This course really changes the way you think, from things as simple as the way graphs are formatted in scientific paper to things as complex as how knowledge is produced and how power is intertwined with our societal ideas of sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for sure. This class is intellectually challenging in terms of what we read. A lot of the stuff can be hard to understand if you just try to skim it. However, the reading workload is not too much so that you can't grasp the information. I love this course and it just changed my whole perspective on sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student. If you are thinking about taking this class even in the slightest pre-register because it is truly the best class I have taken at Yale and I'm pretty confident I'm still going to be singing its praises long after I graduate. Even if you don't identify as LGBTQ, this class is about a lot more than sexuality and everyone can benefit from taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Just be aware that it is a science centered course rather than a traditional WGSS class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a very interesting course and you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. This course is eye-opening. I have learned so much along aside peers I had previously never met. I enjoyed this class so much, there is truly nothing like it. I really believe that regardless of major or interests, this will be an engaging class for anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I left this class with many more questions than answers about human sexuality. A student entering this class should expect to have interesting conversations. And, I think everyone who cares about the politics of gender and sexuality should read Foucault's \"The History of Sexuality\" and \"Wiley's Undoing Monogamy.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you havent be exposed to such in high school. It is a very welcoming atmosphere to express your own thoughts and more importantly learn from others and develop them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this was the best class I've taken at Yale thus far. "
