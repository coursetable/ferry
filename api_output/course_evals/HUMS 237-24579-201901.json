            "\u00a0Critical thinking through discussion, reading a wide body of generally difficult texts, engaging with abstract ideas ",
            "\u00a0Liberalism was a great class that taught me how to think critically about how political ideologies rise in response to social movements, political goings on and religious discontents.\r\n\r\nThe course was at times quite semantic -- Mordu is very socratic and although it felt great to have such free reign to take the class wherever our discussion led us, it could sometimes get to be a bit much. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning how to better understand liberalism, I genuinely learned how to be a better, more selective, and more critical reader of secondary texts. ",
            "\u00a0One of the few classes at Yale where I really felt that I was taught how to think. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of interdisciplinary knowledge of how to read political theory and synthesize the information from readings into reading responses/essays. Learned how to read a variety of sources, including political theory, old political theory, speeches, news articles, long-form journalism, novels, and more. In addition, I also learned how to evaluate documents critically and write good papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think CRITICALLY about liberalism. I would say this course was more about the process of thinking/engaging/understanding than it was about the content per se! "

            "\u00a0Great classes and great readings. It would have been great to get more consistent, timely feedback on the (few) graded assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths  the texts you're working with feel like they have an immediacy and an urgency. It was exciting to read the works! It was also, I think, useful to go through the process of thinking critically about why things are termed the way they are. The class was very rationalistic in the sense that if anyone made a claim, one had to back it up thoroughly and situate their reasoning in historical and socio-political contexts.\r\n\r\nBut that heavy rationalism was also part of the weakness of the course. Because we were so focused on the nitty-gritty micro questions, we often left untouched the bigger and more (in my opinion) interesting questions. Like, for instance, what liberalism actually IS. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that the teaching was very entertaining and engaging, with a lot of historical background information given for each session. There was a lot of context to each of the readings and how they linked together, which is not always given in political science courses. This is helpful to learning, because, without context, there is no way to understand the reasons why the documents were chosen for the class or why we are discussing them. The seminar format helped us to discuss the material in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class. Always engaging. The 2 hours felt like 30 minutes. I have no complaints whatsoever ",
            "\u00a0Great intellectual development, very good ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! I have never seen a class more engaged than this one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Mordechai is an incredible Professor and is really well suited to leading seminar-style classes. The reading and discussions are always interesting and its a great environment for intellectual debate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course with great discussions, a lot of great readings chosen as well. I thought it was a good idea to have the students design their own class and link it with the other classroom material. It would be great for a student who has already taken several political theory courses and is looking forward to talking about the authors that they already know. The teacher is well versed in a lot of different political theory authors ad also in history, which helps to keep the classroom lively and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0110%. This was my favorite class of the semester. Prof. Levy-Eichel is a godsend to Yale! ",
