            "\u00a0This being my first college level philosophy course, I learned several major moral theories such as consequentialism, developed the basic skills of philosophical thinking, and completed my first philosophy papers. The course provided an excellent overview of the study of ethics and philosophy in general and inspired me to tackle challenging problems in other fields of philosophy such as metaphysics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a strong understanding of the basics of the field of ethics and strengthened my ability to construct and deconstruct philosophical arguments. I feel confident in my ability to understand arguments or texts in the field of ethics and articulate my own opinions with more nuance and concision. ",
            "\u00a0Deepened understanding of philosophical enquiries\r\nDevelopment of crucial skills e.g. Identifying philosophical problems and presenting arguments ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to criticize and respond to various schools of ethical thought.  Not only did we learn about what a school of thought said, but we learned how to take a stance and criticize these opinions. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course is the professors flexibility. Combining the knowledge of how well certain materials are understood and what topics interest the students, the professor selected appropriate readings from different textbooks and designed activities such as group debates. The course is of wonderful quality, but what bothered me a little was the extensive pop culture references, with which I was not totally familiar, so it was sometimes a little challenging to understand an example framed in a reference to, for instance, a TV show. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size made each seminar session long and intense, but very rewarding if you came prepared (physically and mentally, as well as academically). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: encourages active participation and engagement under a relaxing yet challenging learning atmosphere ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: open class, seminar format that allowed for discussion and lots of questions, I liked the mix between a lecture format and socratic method that we used, we got TONS of feedback on paper drafts and papers which really improved my writing, readings were short so very manageable for comprehension and analysis\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really "

            "\u00a0Yes, I certainly would. I dont know what the course would be like in the regular school year, but the summer version is certainly recommended. The intimacy of the small class size allows the students and teachers to share their opinions and raise questions whenever they wish. The summer setting is particularly good for the course, because of the objection-response nature of the study of philosophy. The workload was less compared to the other course I took, but the intellectual challenge was somewhat greater. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Ethics is a fascinating if frustrating field and one I think every person should gain at least a cursory familiarity with. This class will give you just that as well as help you strengthen your skills of reading, reasoning, and argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an introductory course that equips students for higher level of academic engagement in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I found it interesting, but I'm not a philosophy major.  I liked that we even critiqued ethics as a whole.  I think this is the best philosophy class I have taken (I have not taken that many) because it was very manageable and well taught, but only if you are interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was great and eye opening. Instructor was also amazing "
