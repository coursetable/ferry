            "\u00a0I learned about different notions of security and anonymity used in practice as well as defined and proved current results in cryptography. All in all the course teaches a formalized version of cryptography that is both interesting and hard, because it is hard to understand the implications of it without having a brief introduction from before.\r\n\r\nSpecifically you learn about security attacks, protocols, anonymity, hash functions, randomness and all the security stuffs. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about cryptography, and the various ideas and goals (not just encryption!) that cryptographic methods aim to achieve. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about cryptography and the fundamentals. Also learned - this only happened later this semester - about the ideas behind a lot of the designs and constructions. I definitely got better at problem solving, and a lot better at reasoning about security proofs, and the characteristics of protocols. ",
            "\u00a0I actually ended up learning a lot about cryptography, the course moves fairly quickly and is demanding. The textbook for the first half of the course is well-written. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about a lot of cryptography, ranging from basic ciphers to complex secret computations. We learned how to prove security using reductions. Overall, the material was rather difficult and abstract for people who did not have experience with the subject. "

            "\u00a0It's very challenging stuff, there are not many strengths in the course, besides the rigorous nature of the problems. It was often unclear as to what was expected of us on problem sets as well as exams. Professor Raykova made it difficult for students who had not seem a crypto proof to understand the motivations behind any of her proofs she presented in class. In addition, the proofs she presented were sloppily scrawled over any free space on the chalk board in what seemed to be 16 pt font, italicized with a transparency of 50%. Not only was this difficult to read, it was also extremely discouraging and many resorted to reading the textbook for support. However the textbook would only last us to the middle of the semester as we finished it upon the midterm and had very little outside material for the remainder of the class.\r\n\r\nI believe that additional structure can be added to slides to show what it is we are doing and why certain arguments are relevant to our security proofs. In addition it can make the slides more focused instead of multiple slides stacked on each other. ",
            "\u00a0The material was pretty interesting and we definitely learned a lot of material. However the class as a whole was definitely poor. ",
            "\u00a0The material is challenging and you will learn a lot by taking this class. However, office hours and support are a little lacking, as they are only 2-3 times a week at times when students may not be available. ",
            "\u00a0I liked Professor Raykova's proof-heavy approach. Her problem sets were not easy, but they taught me a lot, for which I am very grateful. Overall, it's a very information-heavy and pretty challenging course, and I definitely learned the material solidly. \r\nSince this course will not be offered by the same professor ever again, I think I can just skip the rest. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Raykova did not seem to enjoy teaching  sounding bored during her own lectures  and seemed resentful of students she viewed as not putting in enough effort or engaging enough at the same time. She wasn't particularly helpful and probably the least approachable professor I've ever had. Lecture slides were good. PSETs were overall pretty fair and interesting on the theoretical side, though the programming questions ended up being more about socket programming than anything. ",
            "\u00a0The class was poorly organized. The fact that there were somewhat decent slides was a miracle given how poorly everything else went. Even the slides missed information because many (very very complex) proofs were proved on the board in class and no mention of the proof would be in the slides. Furthermore, Professor Raykova sometimes taught things that she even admitted should not have been taught because they were too complex. We spent approximately two weeks on a 6 layer proof, with lemmas proving lemmas proving lemmas, and I don't even think she finished the proof, simply ending with a \"probably shouldn't have taught this to undergrads\". I have no doubt that Professor Raykova is one of the smarter professors at Yale, but her teaching style is dry and unfocused, and leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, cryptography is also a relatively obscure field, and so the supplemental materials you might try to look for are quite complicated, often in the form of academic papers. In some cases, resources might not even exist. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely not if you think this is just a class where you learn some cool crypto stuff. This courses focuses on the theory of cryptography that is still in infancy, hence a ton of formal definitions that are impossible to parse if you don't have a slight background in cryptography. A lot is assumed of the course, however if you are willing to put in the work, this class is rewarding especially when you can solve and analyze interesting security and anonymous problems. ",
            "\u00a0This class is difficult. Not just in the amount of work, but in the complexity of many of the concepts. You will learn a lot of material and it quite a bit of depth which is definitely interesting if you enjoy the content. The professor is very knowledgeable, yet due to this the class can be intimidating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is somewhat mathematically inclined and is interested in learning about cryptography. The class covers a lot of content and homework is comprehensive enough to reinforce whatever is learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on who is teaching it -- if it's structured so that you actually learn and are expected to know the proofs really well, then absolutely take it -- great course. But if you just learn the basic protocols, I can't say if it'll be very worth the credit. ",
            "\u00a0I don't believe Raykova will be teaching this again, so hard to know. The content of the course is quite interesting, I just didn't vibe with the class. ",
            "\u00a0No. Most of the semester was spent studying the material on my own. Much of the class was not well organized, such as the exams. Admittedly, I did not go to all the classes before the midterm and did not have a perfect grasp on the material. As a result, the midterm was very difficult. I then went to every single class afterward, and studied the material to the extent of my abilities. Before the final, I thought I had a good grasp of the material and learned a lot. However, despite this, the final was very difficult, not necessarily because of the material, but because of the format. There were 5 problems that were quite difficult, but not impossible to do. However, we were only given a 75 minute class period to do an exam that was on par with the problem sets. I am usually a fast test taker, but I couldn't even start two of the problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problems were indeed interesting. The problem sets are well designed. However, that only added to the feeling that all the work was done outside of class. Taking this class essentially consisted of poring over the textbook to figure out what the heck went on in class and how to do the problem sets. Professor Raykova refused to help directly on problem sets which was frustrating. This trend persisted elsewhere. I think she genuinely cares for our learning, but she seems to think that her teaching in class is sufficient for us to learn and do the homework. This was evidently not true, and most of our learning focused on simply being able to do the few problems on the homework.\r\n\r\nFor a class that wasn't focused on programming, the programming assignments were actually quite difficult. We did socket programming, and if you don't know what that is, it'll probably be a pain for you too. Just the programming part of the assignments would be difficult than programming assignments for other classes, never mind the difficulty of the proofs which I found harder than Dan's algos. \r\n\r\nThis class is overall a lot of work for not a lot of reward, but a lot of frustration and stress instead. Do not take it.\r\n\r\nIf Mariana Raykova teaches this class again, I advise you not to take it and just find a cryptography textbook and read it on your own. It's not worth taking it for the credit and having all the stress of poorly structured exams and lectures. "
