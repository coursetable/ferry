            "\u00a0Wow I learned so much from this course. I loved Professor Kellem she is so dynamic and awesome. Each case we learned about was interesting itself and then the way she would work legal terms in was very helpful. I felt like I learned so much about law and came away with so much. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about legal traditions and history in the United States, and also learned a lot of fun and interesting stories about legal oddities. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of general legal procedure, interesting legal debates, and overall an appreciation for legal history ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at history critically and with Legal Analysis. I greatly enjoyed being able to converse with the professor and my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Historiography approach to American law tradition, with a focus on the odd and hilarious cases. I simultaneously learned how to write and think about classic concepts in law (i.e. intellectual property, statutory interpretation, the role of language, how appeals work)  while spicing it up with fun cases about anything from pornography to whether a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. This course is a great reminder of how law is interesting and cool and not just the mundane and tedious field that it can sometimes be perceived to be. "

            "\u00a0I can really only think of strengths. She got us all to participate, gave us interesting readings, and led a wonderful class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well organized, Professor is extremely knowledgable, class material was interesting and relatable \r\nWeaknesses: none come to mind ",
            "\u00a0Provide a bit more guidance in written assignments in terms of how they will be graded, and how we can improve in later assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Small size with fascinating professor ",
            "\u00a0The course was slightly lacking in substantive discussion, but I didn't mind because the content was better as a lecture bc there is so much history necessary to understand the context of the cases that we learned. A great strength was Professor Kellem's lecture style. She is super engaging and speaks very eloquently. She also conveys the content in a unique way that is like a story, interspersed with quips and jokes that keep things fun and light. The content is also super interesting overall. "

            "\u00a0There are not that many assignments. Sometimes the grading on the assignments seems a little arbitrary but she definitely pushes you. Professor Kellem is awesome so if you think you are interested in the law at all this is a great course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great seminar with new topics every week, a passionate and knowledgable instructor, and reasonable work requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It examines law from a really fun and interesting angle without sacrificing any valuable learning. The professor also did not presume we had any legal background and was happy to answer basic questions. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! It was so incredible to get a wide variety of topics covered in an intimate setting. Whether you know a lot about law, or are just a beginner (I was in the latter category), this course is well adjusted for everyone. Every topic was so interesting and the discussion every week was never boring. The combination of learning the case law and history behind every topic we covered (from nomenclature debates and wording discrepancies to the insanity defense and intellectual property) gave us such an opportunity to dive into every part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Yes Yes. The Professor was really engaging and fun to learn from. This was my favorite class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course since the content is very interesting and unique, and you are unlikely to find another class at Yale like it. Professor Kellem is also a super cool person and she is also a yale grad, so she sympathizes with us. She is really interested in oddities throughout history (just ask her about new haven's own P.T. Barnum!) It is a nice class to balance out your schedule with such a unique class, the workload is light but the readings are always super interesting and not long (50 pgs max per week)!! I would definitely recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This course was awesome, in large part because Professor Kellem is awesome! She definitely knows her stuff, and the seminar was made interesting by her insights and the carefully-curated syllabus. The readings were pretty fair in length, and we only had like one or two main readings per week which allowed in-depth conversation about their legal ramifications, which I loved. Also, Professor Kellem does an awesome job of facilitating conversation, and making sure that everyone feels comfortable expressing their views. The workload was pretty light in the sense that we only really had three main assignments, but be forewarned that you should start on the final paper early on. It's a great opportunity to write about a legal topic you genuinely like, but she expects some robust research of different sources, so engage with something you can see yourself writing at least 15-20 pages on.
