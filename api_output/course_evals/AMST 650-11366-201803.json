            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to some of the most important works in history and anthropology addressing issues of the subaltern, peasant movements, insurgency and counter-insurgency, and millenarianism in modern Latin America. We grappled with how to define and identify subaltern resistance as well as how to theorize the state and its relationship with marginalized social groups. I also appreciated the opportunity to think about various approaches that can be used to capture subaltern experience, particularly different ways of doing ethnography and oral history. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to recent debates in Latin American Studies. Preparing presentations was also a great learning experience because it trains students to present their ideas coherently and to engage with other opinions. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a new perspective of the different methodologies employed by historians and anthropologists to study forms of local and grassroots resistance across Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of resistance as a concept and how that is applied in interactions that Latin American countries have with hegemonic countries during the Cold War. I also understand how anthropology and fieldwork can be cross-applied into the historical method. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge on the different methodologies that anthropologists and historians use when doing field work in Latin America, insight into the ethical dilemmas that scholars grapple with, and a greater understanding of the field of resistance studies in the context of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an excellent opportunity to explore the different ways history and anthropology intersect. It encourages students to think more deeply about the meanings of resistance, power, and hegemony. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent reading list; great moderation by Professor Joseph; appropriate, reasonable reading and work load; thoughtful comments on submitted work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sometimes veered into nitpicking of books' oversights; expectations for class presentations could have been more clearly stated from the beginning of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Main strength is the instructor and the material he assigns. Professor Joseph ie an exceptional mentor who values student learning. He is engaging, respectful but also critical; I learned a lot from his feedback. He also makes himself available and is always willing to help with presentation and paper topics. ",
            "\u00a0The student-led discussions were great to get the conversation going on the weeks readings. My only concern is that the recommended readings were not discussed as much and they could have greatly complimented our discussions on the main reading. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized in terms of its structure and cohesiveness. All the themes tied in nicely together with the books thoughtfully linking resistance movements and survival strategies in different countries and regions in Latin America, culminating in the question of globalization. ",
            "\u00a0I think the courses strengths are the texts we had the opportunity to read which represented excellent examples of scholarship. Being able to speak with many of the authors of the texts we read was also extremely informative. Professor Joseph was also a knowledgeable and thoughtful seminar leader. I don't see any room for improvement; I found the seminar wonderful as it was. ",
            "\u00a0This class fosters excellent engagement and gives a great survey of resistance across Latin America. It would be potentially useful if the role of the weekly discussants  was just to raise questions rather than to present on the texts, as the presentations frequently turned into summaries. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, and any opportunity to study with Professor Joseph. He is a wonderful, kind, and thoughtful teacher. And the reading list for this course is absolutely essential for anyone interested in subaltern studies and/or modern Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a Latin Americanist, you should take this course (or any class with Joseph). As I mentioned, it highlights the major themes in the study of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that has a great reading selection for any student interested in modern Latin America. I would highly recommend this course as it will give you a new perspective on methods used to study resistance. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend the course if you are willing to put in the work and are interested in studying an insightful Latin American history and resistance movements from the ground up. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course should be taken by anyone interested in Latin America and the Cold War. "
