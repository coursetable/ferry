            "\u00a0I was exposed to a wide, very interesting variety of world literatures. ",
            "\u00a0We read a very wide range of texts in this class, probably the widest selection of literature Ive ever read. We learned how to interpret literature and art of every media: poetry, short story, novel, oral tradition, film, photograph, etc. We also were exposed to ways of connecting seemingly unrelated texts that come from divergent traditions or cultures. ",
            "\u00a0How to Read allowed me to get in touch with texts that I would not have encountered otherwise, at least not as an undergraduate. Mishima's The Little Drum, Sembene's The Promise Land, and Sweeney Astray were particularly stimulating works that fit this category. I am very grateful to Katie Trumpener for expanding my literary horizon and whetting my appetite for more works beyond the Western canon. And for keeping Blake and Joyce on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This course engages with many different types of text, from poetry to music videos. It was very interesting to learn how one should approach different kinds of materials and how the book came into being. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think this class has the potential to become a great course. I like the idea of it, but the execution could have been a lot better. We covered poetry, prose, drama, etc. but we didn't actually learn how to approach those texts in a specific manner. Some theory regarding that would have helped. I found myself approaching all these various texts with the same techniques. ",
            "\u00a0The variety and wide reach of the course was both its strength and weakness. Readings were done that never ended up being discussed at all, and sometimes a single of the many readings assigned was the sole focus of discussion. It was interesting to sample a great deal of texts, but also difficult because there was so much to tackle at once, and at times depth was sacrificed for breadth. In some instances, class discussion seemed aimless and not directed enough. ",
            "\u00a0The diversity of the syllabus and the unexpected connections between the various texts form the course's greatest strength. It was beautiful to trace the parallels between Basho's The Journey of 1684 and the English Romantics, for instance. I am very grateful to Prof. Trumpener for embedding beyond-the-classroom activities, particularly our visit to the Yale Rep for Ibsen's An Enemy of the People. \r\n\r\nI so wish that our discussions were more focused. While I certainly made many discoveries about the philosophical and literary preferences of my peers, shifting the spotlight to the texts themselves (as opposed to the tastes of our readers) would only deepen our appreciation of the various works. Abstract comments (\"I found this hard to understand because the storyline was elusive\") doesn't quite get there. ",
            "\u00a0Because there were so many texts that spanned different time periods and countries, it was sometimes difficult to contextualize the material we were engaging with. I also wish we read more secondary works about the texts to discuss academic theories on how to read. "

            "\u00a0I would not. I think there are stronger courses out there. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. To be fair, this was a new class this year, and that means that things havent been figured out completely in terms of how best to teach it. On the other hand, much could be improved, and this class was not my favorite. If youre a literature major, you have no choice here, and hopefully you will glean something from this course. If youre not, there are better literature classes out there. ",
            "\u00a0Let's face it, all of us undergraduates have much to learn about reading. If you are a literature major, you will need to take this course whether or not it is recommended to you. If you are not a literature major (or even need a humanities credit, frankly), you will feel right at home in this setting. The level of discussion is accessible to all (perhaps a bit too accessible). As long as Katie Trumpener is at the helm, the selection of readings is guaranteed to be thought-provoking. You will have field trips to look forward to and written assignments with a creative twist if that tickles your fancy. Keep one thing in mind: it might be appropriate to change the name of the course to \"what to read.\" "
