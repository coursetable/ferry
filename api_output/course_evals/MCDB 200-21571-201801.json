            "\u00a0Lectures were good, but sometimes poorly organized. Information was interesting. Sections were just completely pointless--we would read a paper and answer questions about it, then spend all of section recapping our answers to the questions. Tests were extremely detailed, and the information wasn't really provided anywhere. Their strategy of \"lets shove information at them and expect them to memorize all of it for every test\" isn't how I think biology should be taught. I know nobody in the class is going to remember half of the ridiculous details we needed to know for the tests after summer. ",
            "\u00a0Professors were engaging, course material was interesting, and discussion sections helped to clarify main ideas from the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The content of the course was interesting and the book was pretty good. Discussion sections were the best part of the class, reading papers that expanded on lecture topics: reading about the application of the ideas both reinforced understanding and helped with intuition of experimental methods. The last week of lectures  on biomedicine and genome engineering were also very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures often got a little boring, and sometimes felt pointless when the slides were printed for us and the content echoed the book. The class was small enough to be taught more like a seminar, and I think this could've been very successful. Tests were also not very intellectually stimulating or a well representative. ",
            "\u00a0I wish it weren't at 9 am because it was so hard to stay awake. Other than that, I found the lectures good and I liked how the lectures were printed for us. ",
            "\u00a0The content was interesting, the book was pretty good, and the discussion sections analyzing primary sources was my favorite part. However, the lectures were often somewhat boring, especially when they simply conveyed the same information as the textbook but less in-depth. The tests were also not particularly engaging or representative of a deep level of understanding of the material. I think the class was small enough to be taught in a more seminar style, and that would have been a much more enjoyable way to learn the content. ",
            "\u00a0The course exams are definitely very memorization heavy so if you dont put in many hours of studying you wont do well ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a hard course that requires a lot of hard-core memorization from students. However, it was organized well and I legitimately learned quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized and very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of memorization, but to be fair it comes with the material I guess. ",
            "\u00a0One big strength of the course was that it used many examples of applications of molecular biology for drug development, novel disease treatment strategies, and industrial/agricultural uses, which made the topics more interesting and relatable. The topics were ordered in a mostly cumulative and comprehensive manner, although the flow might be improved by discussing protein structure earlier so that topics like the structure of the DNA polymerase active site make more sense. Overall, the syllabus was ordered well and facilitated effective learning. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material but unfair tests ",
            "\u00a0The professors are truly the best in the field and offered insightful and clear explanations. Whenever they were approached for a question they were able to give very clear answers. The first and third exams were fair but the second exam was far too long and quite unfair. The biggest weakness of the class was section. I did not feel that the TA knew enough to answer questions in a substantive manner and the students were not very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a good scope, but at times the tests got bogged down in very esoteric details that seemed too detailed for the scope of the course. I would like to see either a more narrow scope focused more on details of fewer processes, or to be tested less on tiny specifics. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this course would have been way better if it had just not been at 9am and far away from everything. A major strength was the papers we read for section and the discussions we had about them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its two professors (Prof. Isaacs and Prof. Pyle), both of whom invest a great deal of effort into organizing and communicating the core information of the class, as well as the weekly discussion sections. In the latter, which were effectively journal clubs, we discussed the classic molecular biology papers at the beginning of the semester and then moved on to more recent papers about tethered ribosomes, riboswitches, ASOs, and CRISPR/Cas9. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fascinating and very updated. However, the methods of testing students were very much lacking. Instead of focusing on big picture ideas on how everything related, we were often asked extremely specific questions that realistically would not be beneficial to know in any setting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: intersting material, engaging lectures, great professors, good class format (three in class assessments, one final and two midterms, non-cumluative, equally weighted), manageable workload. Overall, a great class, would recommend. Weaknesses: First, there is huge amount of reading in the textbook, and it wasn't clear how we should be doing the reading. Reading and memorizing every detail clearly wasn't expected (nor would it have been feasible, given the amount assigned), but I would have loved to know why exactly the professors were assigning this reading. Was it the to reinforce concepts learned already in class? To introduce new concepts not covered in lecture at a less detailed lever? Or something else? This would have helped guide me in how I did the reading each week. Second, there was a lot of memorization for midterms and the final, and not of thinking or problem solving. Third, from what the professors said (\"We generally set the boundaries so that about half of students will get an A or A-), I believe the course is graded on a curve, and that is perfect for this class: the professors write very difficult tests, making a wide grade distribution, and then the scores are curved up. I am unsure if the professors add up the scores of the two midterms, the final, and all of the homeworks, and then, based on a ranking of students, determine letter grades, or if they individually curve each assignment (i.e. above a 90% on midterm 1 is an A), and from that determine final letter grades. If they do the latter, homework grades present a problem. The average homework grade was very high, and the scores were very clustered. This means that missing just a few points on homework all semester might move a student from near the top of the class in terms of homework grade to close to the bottom, with predictable consequences for final grade. Fourth, sometimes I felt a little like I was being thrown to the wolves on the homeworks; I would have appreciated a forum to ask clarifying questions about the article before we graded on our understanding of it, and I was always unsure whether professor/TF office hours were an appropriate place for such questions.

            "\u00a0It's painful at times... a lot of times. If you are looking for MCDB core classes to take, cell bio and physiology are better in my opinion. The information is interesting and the professors are smart but the class should be taught better and sections are really a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course provided me with a comprehensive and expansive overview of fundamental knowledge of molecular biology. Reading about applications and new research was inspiring and allowed for a chance to explore the more creative aspects of biology. ",
            "\u00a0Not a lot of work; 3 equally weighted exams (the last one being during finals week but not cumulative). Every week you have to read a paper and answer some questions and then discuss it in section. Note that this year mandatory section was at 9:25 on Fridays so even though it was listed as MW class it did meet on Fridays as well. Taught by two professors, Pyle and Isaacs, who are both very knowledgable in the field. ",
            "\u00a0The content is interesting, but the structure of the class was underwhelming and a bit boring, However, still worthwhile if you're interested in genetics, and get to spend some time with primary sources in section. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you need it for core because the exams are fair, the homework is fine, and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It's good if you are interested in the subject material, just goes more in depth into familiar molecular biology topics from high school or intro biology courses. Reading and analyzing primary research is interesting and valuable. However, not a particularly engaging class structure. ",
            "\u00a0If youre very interested in molecular biology then this is a great course. If youre not interested/unwilling to memorize lots of information this isnt the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend, but this course is not easy. You really really need a strong basis in orgo and a really good memory to be able to get a good grade in the class. The professors are both excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course for MCDB majors to learn the basics (but comprehensive) topics of Molecular Biology. I really feel that I learned a lot, and the professors never made the material feel dull. ",
            "\u00a0This was a pretty straightforward bio class. Memorize everything on the slides and work quickly and you should be fine for the exams. The professors are pretty strict about lateness/absences for section so be careful about that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great introductory class, not that bad work-wise, but can be a lot of material between the exams. (There are 3 exams and each is worth 25%, the rest is HW, no final) ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in biological research because the many of the concepts are fundamental to understanding lab techniques and experimental design. The course is well structured to learn the material, and sections are well designed to apply your understanding to interpret the current scientific literature. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to molecular biology but be prepared to take tests that are unfair and do not reflect the work you put in to prepare for them ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if you are and MCDB major and want a lecture that is a bit smaller and allows you to ask questions and get to know the professors. It is challenging but the exams are by cumulative which is helpful. If you are in a biology lab this is also a great class because it allows you to really learn the basis of a lot of the techniques that you are using. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if you are interested in molecular knowledge of cells. It's interesting, but the subject is very specific and studying for it is a must. Don't just take the class if you aren't fully interested in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great class that has both depth and breadth. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good for people who like molecular biology, and does not require a heavy background in organic chemistry. I think it has made me interested in studying more biochemistry so I can better understand the processes we discussed, so if that is what you're into then this course is valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you can make it to the 9am lectures and not fall asleep during them. And if youre interested in the nitty gritty details of DNA and RNA. The lectures and material were moderately interesting, though there wasnt much instructor-student engagement. Dont buy the textbook its at least $90 online and I only used it once to clarify some material I had missed during lecture. There is mandatory weekly section, but it was actually pretty interesting and productive because it was journal club style and well done. The papers we read were a little boring at the beginning but by the end they were pretty cool. Every week we had to prepare for section by answering questions about the papers, which did help to focus the content but took several hours to complete. There were three equally weighted exams, which were difficult because there was so much memorization involved (maybe too much focus on memorizing details and names of enzymes rather than concepts) but there was usually a good curve. I appreciated that the lecture slides were printed out for us every time because I never would have been able to write fast enough otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to an MCDB major, as it delves into fundamental concepts of molecular biology and teaches you to analyze and understand recent discoveries in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student, as while the information itself is fascinating, the course was a headache. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. Most of my thoughts are in strengths/weaknesses answer, but overall it's a good, interesting class with a moderate but not impossible workload. "
