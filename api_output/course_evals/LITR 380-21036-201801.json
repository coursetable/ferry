            "\u00a0Learned how to critically analyze a Hitchcockian film ",
            "\u00a0I got to take really close look at Hitchcock, and learned quite a bit about film and filmmaking along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Great knowledge of film analysis, history, and Hithcock's oeuvre ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the close analysis of film and about the interplay of different aspects of film to achieve a larger goal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically evaluate films, and developed a greater understanding for film history in general. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a survey of Alfred Hitchcock's films over a span of about fifty years. We watched a range of films, from lesser known \"Blackmail\" and \"Frenzy,\" through well-known classics like \"Rear Window,\" \"Vertigo,\" \"North by Northwest,\" and \"Psycho.\" Before our class meeting each week, we were expected to watch the film, read the assigned scholarly articles on it (usually two, not very long), and write a one paragraph response to the film. In class, three people would present briefly (very basic, no need to prepare extensively) on the film's production history, reception, and interesting things to note from the Hitchcock-Truffaut interviews. Professor Peucker then would show us prepared clips of important sequences, and we would discuss each one, focusing especially on the use of the camera contributed to the scene. You don't have to have taken a film course before for this course to be accessible to you. You will learn a lot if you are committed to engaging with the films, the articles, and in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Hitchcock, his films, and close analysis of film in general ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop my close analysis skills, and also provided a fascinating look into the mind of a talented, but sometimes unsettling, director. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a greater deal about auteurship and how directors such as Hitchcock go about creating their own style. "

            "\u00a0The class was great for anyone interested in film. When I took it, there were way too many people enrolled, which unfortunately took away some of the discussion aspects. Also, it can be a bit long, after an hour we tend to start over analyzing the work. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the discussion style format of the course. However, at times people would be a little reluctant to talk, which made discussion kind of difficult, so if that could be improved somehow that would be good. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have a 15 min lecture at the beginning to facilitate discussion and learn more about the movies not evident from the production or reception. ",
            "\u00a0The course could do with a bit more organizing in terms of Hitchcock's motifs and elements such as staircases, blonds etc. I would have liked to address the motifs and how they play out in each film we watched, but we only discussed them if they happened to come up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really interesting discussions and analysises. Weaknesses: classes tended to feel much too long. ",
            "\u00a0There were just too many people!! If the class had been capped at 20 or 25 at most, it would have made it a much more engaging course for everyone I think. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that it is supposed to be a seminar, but the number of students in the class and the classroom arrangement we had made it feel more like a lecture. People were less engaged and willing to participate because of this. Professor Peucker didn't cold-call people, so there were often silences before many of the same people raised their hands to participate. \r\nThe strength of this course is the amount of material it is able to cover while only meeting once a week. I left each class understanding a film much better and was able to better articulate my thoughts about it, especially when the discussion was livelier. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great films, professor Peucked knows so much and does a good job facilitating discussion \r\nWeaknesses: classes are long but its also nice to have a large chunk of time to discuss each film. Since the class is all Hitchcock it gets slightly repetitive towards the end but in general all of his films have a different feel so its never too bad. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very good introductory course; its main weakness, which could be difficult to address, is that only a handful of Hitchcock's many films are seen and discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course runs overall pretty well. I think that the class was too large to effectively lead discussion. "

            "\u00a0Yes! A fantastic, fun, and engaging course. The films are interesting and entertaining, and the seminars are thought-provoking and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a good one, although with only a few assignments things can go a little unexpectedly in terms of your grade. It is a good way to learn a lot about film though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! if you want an interesting film course that teaches you about the most important films of this essential director, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The material that you cover is interesting and Professor Peucker is extremely knowledgeable and encouraging in prompting students to find unique insights. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an amazing class for all majors and the professor is GREAT! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are looking for a calm class that is still enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it because Hitchcock has been incredibly influential for modern and contemporary directors, so you can learn in what ways he continues to inspire others. Also, he was so prolific and his work so varied that spending a semester focusing only on his films does not get boring but rather gives you a good understanding of how his career and sensibilities changed over time. They're also just great films that are worth watching for their own sakes. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome class, workload is not too intense but the topics covered are fascinating and the films are amazing. Prof. Peucker is so kind and smart, a wonderful professor that creates an amazing class environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to learn about Hitchcock definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in Hitchcock, film studies in general, or someone who simply wants to take an interesting, but not too rigorous, film course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because I do think it provides a good avenue for both film beginners and experts. Hitchcock's film are all interesting cinematically and narratively making the work enjoyable. "
