Really liked the selection, especially liked reading newspaper articles about the different topics in different contexts. \r\n- Liked using game theory to understand market dynamics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- The final project did not seem to be very aligned with the class content. It ended up being more of an entrepreneurial pursuit (designing a business plan or thinking through an expansion ) rather than understanding the institutional context or the larger market dynamics. \r\n- Some overlap with State and Society. Repetitive for MBA students. \r\n- For those who have already working in development or in other countries -- which is most of the class -- much of the material was somewhat obvious and predictable. The class helped put some frameworks on these concepts, but the concepts themselves were not new news. \r\n- Little engagement with the class. I think would be better in smaller classroom, with more discussion between students "
