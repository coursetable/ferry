            "\u00a0The strengths were the interesting content. The weakness was the way it was conveyed. There was too much lecture and not enough discussion. Often when there was discussion the ideas put forward by students was rejected and not allowed to be discussed further. As an ethics class i think this is a great opportunity for friendly and structured debate, yet it seemed that there was always a correct answer. This discouraged further participation. It also should be scheduled as an hour long class if it will always run an hour. It was difficult to sit in class and focus and absorb what was being taught when it was not clear when the class would be ending. It is was also hard to plan other meetings in the evening as we did not know how long the class would last. It is reasonable for the class to be more than 50 minutes, but if that is the case then that should be made clear to everyone taking the class. I felt that it was disrespectful to my time that the class would consistently run longer than the agreed upon time. Finally it was difficult to keep track of the readings for the class since we were often behind schedule. The readings themselves were interesting and pertinent and very reasonable in length, however they were often discussed two or more weeks after they were assigned and therefore it was often difficult to remember the detail of the readings and have a productive discussion about the readings. I think this was often taken as evidence that we did not do the readings, but I think, at least in my case, that the issue was more that they were no longer fresh in my mind. ",
            "\u00a0I very much appreciated the approach that this class took to discussion ethical conduct in research. Instead of simply saying that plagiarism is bad and against school policy (which is how many ethics classes could go), this course allowed the students to engage in why plagiarism is bad, what the consequences should or should not be, why it matters, and how the system is set up to favor certain cases of ethical violations. \r\n\r\nAs far as weakness of the course, it was set up as a discussion-based class and stated that participation was required, but struggled to actively and effectively engage everyone or keep track of who was participating. In the future, a suggestion I have would be to employ other methods of class participation that do not rely on raising hands and being called on in a full-class discussion. These methods could include brief written responses (1 sentence to a paragraph), smaller group discussion, full class assessments such as clicker questions or polls. A mix of these various forms of participation can involve everyone, even those who may not feel comfortable or who might not get called on in a \"class discussion\" setting. ",

            "\u00a0I like the structure of the course: the reading load is great for graduate students taking many other classes and working in lab.  Moreover, I like that the course has current content from ethical issues being figured out now.  I would like to see more of Yale ethical issues and how they were dealt with at this institution. ",

One suggestion might be a more structured syllabus where all assigned readings are clearly stated; another suggestion might be going a bit broader with different topics. Sometimes I felt that we spent way too much time on a particular subject. ",
