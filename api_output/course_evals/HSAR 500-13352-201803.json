            "\u00a0I think in particular I walk away with a rock solid understanding of scholars such as David Lewis-Williams, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edward Snow, Roland Barthes, Leo Bersani, Linda Nochlin, Yve-Alain Bois, T.J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss as well as functional understandings of Hegel, Riegl, Panofsky, Geertz, Gombrich, Fried, Derrida. HSAR 500 in that respect succeeded in its primary objective as a survey of critical texts in the history of art.\r\n\r\nI feel a new sense of commitment to some of the concerns raised by Carol Armstrong over the course of the seminar, in particular, her notionwhich I read now as a variation of Boiss notion of blackmailto let the object determine the lens, or method of analysis, rather than trying to make the object do what we as scholars would like it to do. This arguably flows from her commitments to formalism as a scholar (at least, as I understand them in thumbnail), which I happen to agree with heartily: letting a solid ekphrasis anchor whatever critical or theoretical texts we graft onto the paper afterwards. \r\n\r\nI also found myself crossing a rubicon of sorts at the level of practice. I normally am only able to write from approximately 9am in the morning to 1pm in the afternoon. Accepting that the 15 page methods paper was a kind of mere exercise, I embarked rather freely and breezily on its proseworking from 1pm until sundown most days this reading period. It was liberating. I wrote with sass, spunk, verve, or just perhaps with an irritating jocularity and felt far less inhibited than I usually would on a typical research paper. Again, the adjective breezy comes to mind. I trotted out very typical arguments for the canvass I worked with, but was arriving at those arguments by interesting means. I mean, it was also a chance to shamelessly plug out formal analysis and be rather lyrical about it, which I always appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the structure of the reading response assignments over the course of the semester. Focusing closely on a single text gave me the confidence to be less reliant on other scholarly interpretations of texts and overall, helped me develop a reading and writing skill I am happy to have. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a helpful methodological basis for our first year as art history graduate students. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of different methodological approaches to art history. I came to understand more clearly a number of very important, dense texts, and became familiar with various crucial thinkers I had not read. I feel it will substantially assist my future work and undergird ensuing study. ",
            "\u00a0We learned the various methodologies of history of art ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new appreciation for the historiographical elements of art history and enjoyed the opportunity to trace developments in thought from the early 1800s through to the present. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to think critically about theoretical methods and to compare various theoretical models. I developed a vocabulary of theory and a better understanding of developing and crafting an argument based on an object or set of objects. ",

            "\u00a0I think the major weakness of the course for me was in its writing assignments. This was a function of having to volunteer to read a brief 1-2 page paper on the subsequent sessions reading before we had read those texts for the next week. I consequently found myself throwing a dart at the syllabus, having not before encountered a number of these texts. I would want to present on days that I wasnt committed to presenting, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at some intellectual bauble buried in the prose, and having to confine my comments to whatever loose oral reasoning I could hack out in the duration of the course. I think in the future, we ought simply to just ask for volunteers on the day of. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the course seemed to be strangely staggered. As is typical of graduate seminars (and so shouldnt be thought as a particular shortcoming of this seminar), we managed to only get through a half to third of the content for a single session, and so would try to recapitulate key themes from the previous session in the following week. I received this gesture as an act of mnemonic recalla pedagogical move designed to summon up our weak memories of the previous weeks text and rehearse them for better future recollectionbut in practice found that the texts we didnt cover at length just oozed back down in the black gap spanning Friday to Friday, lost to the waters of Lethe. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked a week devoted to critical race studies in addition to our week on white feminist models. It seems to me to be a major omission to leave out what postcolonial and decolonial approaches have introduced to the discipline. I would have also liked greater integration of gendered and raced critiques throughout the course in order to enact the political stakes of these models for destabilizing white/western forms of knowledge in the field of art history. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course that it was comprehensive yet organized in its approach. The weakness was that class discussion did not always flow naturally because students spoke to the professor rather than too each other. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor's engagement with the material across a vast variety of periods and approaches was incredible. The instructor was able to help students parse the very dense, complex material. The syllabus was well-designed and allowed students to either be introduced to or gain deeper familiarity with numerous foundational texts in the discipline. The bi-weekly assignments were very useful indeed for ensuring that I continually thought deeply about the readings and was able to work through some of the more difficult ideas. I think it could have been helpful, though, not to read our papers aloud but instead to do short presentations, perhaps with slides, with the goal of raising several questions and pointing to passages of interest. I found it a bit hard to fully engage with other students' ideas in this formatI think extemporaneous speaking might have been more engaging, if based on notes and prior thought. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured, and the materials were pertinent. They were, however, a bit biased towards modern and contemporary art. By the inclusion of more interpretative models that can be applied to earlier periods, the assigned readings could have been made more diverse. ",
            "\u00a0While I enjoyed the historiographical element of the course, it was at times difficult to balance it along with the desire to understand how best to apply different methodological approaches in our own studies. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness was a lack of contemporary theory, which I'd have liked to see more of. Benefits: it was traditionally comprehensive, and the professor had us think critically about theorists/methodologies that many are apt to simply dismiss. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the clear explanations of the main themes of each reading (and comparisons with previous others) would be helpful for the comprehension of all the students. Sometimes, discussions seemed to dwell too intently on particularities rather than the main points. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - breadth of material; readings reflect diverse perspectives/interpretations on a single model\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish there was a more formal introduction/lecture discussing the week's theoretical model at the beginning of each class. I felt there was little structure and that class was at the whim of a student's question or response paper. There was never a clear analysis discussion of what the theoretical model meant at its most basic level, so I was often lost for the more advanced questions. There was little discussion between classmates. Instead students asked questions to the professor, and there was little continuity. "

            "\u00a0I dont think many students get a choice as to whether or not they ought to take such a class. I might recommend it to my Slavist colleagues, however. I find that theres a species of Slavistwho are trained primarily as russophone textual scholarswho want to work more with objects, but lack the kind of buttressing to do that. Admittedly, the course doesnt teach visual analysis per se (the assumption I reckon being if you wound up at art history at Yale, you can read a painting), which is what many of these students are lacking. However, I hear, for instance, Slavists talk about iconography as if this word exclusively pointed to the devotional art of Eastern Orthodoxy, and specifically, to the icon itself, and I cringe inwardly and want to lob Panofsky at them. Theres a whole corpus of texts that they ought to read, if I have to read Boris Eikhenbaum and Mikhail Bakhtin and Roman Jakobson. Disciplinary parity, for real, yall. ",
            "\u00a0It's required for art history grads and I actually think it might be better if only art history students could take it as the class size was too large. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course. I think it is essential to be grounded in an understanding of different methodological approaches. Prof. Armstrong is brilliant and is able to really get into absolutely every theoretical text one might encounter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is essential to any graduate art history student, which provides a great foundation on which any research can be built. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Armstrong was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students as I think it is important to understand the origins of the discipline - both for the advantages it offers and the weaknesses that we as emerging art historians can seek to remedy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- a strong baseline for any art history PhD student. I wish it could be extended to a second semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for its invaluable foundation to the study of the history of art. "
