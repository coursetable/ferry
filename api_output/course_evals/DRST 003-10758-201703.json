            "\u00a0I learned how to approach and analyze the foundational texts of Western philosophy. Reading Plato and Aristotle at the beginning of the semester was challenging, but over time I came to appreciate their difficulty. Essays were also quite difficult to perfect; however, my writing did improve over the course of the semester thanks to very constructive feedback from Professor Werner. In our in-class discussions, I definitely learned how to discuss complex philosophical questions with my classmates, and Professor Werner did a fantastic job of facilitating that discussion. Since taking this class, I've begun to apply the lessons of philosophy to my everyday life, so I would say the skills I learned from this class are truly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about philosophy, how to write a philosophy paper, what philosophy really is (very logical)\r\nI learned about some of the greatest thinkers and what they think on the greatest issues:\r\ngod, the soul, happiness, the good life, free will. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a broad introduction to early philosophic ideas and gave me a good foundation for future philosophic writing and argument. ",
            "\u00a0All the students in this course gained a broad understanding of ancient philosophy. In addition, we each improved our discussion and writing skills, and we developed our ability to understand what real philosophical argumentation means. ",
            "\u00a0I learned, for the first time, how to write philosophy papers and think in a philosophical way. I learned how to think logically and make an argument. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about philosophy, and several different philosophers' point of views and thoughts on interesting topics such as the soul, death, god, and where we humans stand in all of this. ",
            "\u00a0Prior to taking this course, I had little to no experience writing philosophy essays. Over the course of the semester, I learned how to decipher philosophical material, reconstruct the steps of an argument, and identify it's underlying premises and potential weaknesses. Each class we had two central questions to guide our reading and discussion. Thanks to this, I feel like I've learned a way to approach philosophical material without getting overwhelmed by the density of the content. I also learned how to think in such a way that I didn't look just for flaws in the authors' argument but found a way to reconcile their thoughts with my own. In our papers, we were not only asked to reconstruct an argument, but question it and explore specific ideas and their implications in depth. Often your own beliefs can contact the author's, but thanks to the structure of the essay, I feel like I found a way to present the author's ideas and maintain my own voice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about writing in Philsophy. Particularly, I learned to break up philosophical proofs and analyze them. ",
            "\u00a0I've learnt to analyse the materials closely, strictly sticking the evidence found in the original texts. The cycle of preparation, class discussion, lecture, and writing assignment, I could profoundly grasp the paradigm of philosophical contemplation, which was formed, challenged, and reconstructed by well-known philosophers. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is designed to give you a quick look at some of the most important works in the history of philosophical thought, and to that end it is very successful. The class discussions were well-organized and productive, but only given that everyone had done the assigned readings. In one respect, this course is weak in that we don't spend a lot of time discussing some really important texts, mostly because we have so many other texts to read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned I don't like Philosophy, so my low level of engagement is my own fault. I found it unengaging to reconstruct the unclear arguments about subjects I'm not sure I buy. For instance, we spend all this time about the soul, and the different qualities of the soul, but I remain unconvinced that there is in fact a soul. \r\nI also walked away without answers or even clarity on any of the subjects we discussed. \r\nThis isn't a problem with the course, though, as much as the intrinsic qualities of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0The reading load for this course is really manageable and engaging. However, because students are discouraged from consulting secondary sources, it is difficult to make sense of a lot of the ideas contained in the texts until seminars or lecture, which can be very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I will expound upon this more in my instructor evaluation, but Professor Werner was easily the greatest part about this course. His ability to facilitate discussions, encourage students to speak up and voice their opinions, and commitment to helping out students beyond the classroom made this class an incredible learning experience. There are not any major weaknesses to this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would have been helpful if we received more background about the texts we were reading. I also think that we advanced too quickly sometimes because I barely understood one text before we were already moving on to the next. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really interesting; occasionally too much reading to really process in time for class, but I really enjoyed all the reading. ",
            "\u00a0I thought professor Werner was really intelligent, and his comments in class were always very insightful and really helped me understand the material. I think sometimes the speed of the class (which is simply unavoidable given the structure of DS) made is so that it sometimes felt like we werent giving each work its due. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the structure of our class in which we began with a question or two that guided the discussion. The questions helped focus my reading and comments so that I was working to solve a specific puzzle rather than give a summary of the text. Professor Werner also actively encouraged participation and built off  each person's comments  to show a general theme or question within the work.  Because of this, I felt like all of our discussions actually led somewhere instead of just listening to a series of scattered points.Despite the pace of the class, I felt that I did get a deeper understanding though seminar discussions and delving into a single idea in my essay. Professor Werner also took time to practice philosophy writing strategies in class so that we were better prepared for the essays. I think this extra practice not only helped improve my writing in my semester papers, but will continue to influence my writing style on other papers as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the close relationship with the professor (especially as for philosophy, it is difficult to understand the texts all by myself, so I appreciate the fact that I could ask questions whenever I wanted), good essay questions, and the study guide for the final (it was extremely helpful to review the texts we've covered throughout the semester) "

            "\u00a0If you do DS, absolutely take this class with Professor Werner. He is very committed to his students' learning and is great at explaining the difficult concepts I struggled with over the course of the semester. His essay feedback is critical, but all of it serves to improve your writing by making it more focused and persuasive. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. There are better ways to spend your time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as they are genuinely interested in learning about ancient philosophy. As with any course, one's interest in the topic is a necessary precursor to enjoying the class. If you are interested in philosophy, this is an incredible way to be introduced to it. Although it was challenging, the broad, chronological overview gave me an introduction to many different types of philosophy, and the papers were a great opportunity to delve deeply into one area that I was more interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: Lots for interesting material, good writing instruction and practice. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I gained numerous critical reading and thinking skills that I will continue to use not only in other philosophy classes but in all my future classes. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly would! I loved Philosophy because it truly gave me an introduction to the great questions the western canon has been trying to answer all along. These questions remain relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since I believe DS philosophy is the best opportunity for first-years to learn what it is to contemplate philosophically, and form the solid system of thoughts, based upon the gifts we receive from celebrated philosophers and the professor/classmates. "
