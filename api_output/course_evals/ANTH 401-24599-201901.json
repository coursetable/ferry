            "\u00a0This course taught me so much. It taught me a new way to look at the world and think about why I find nature so compelling. It taught me new ways to think about my own experiences. It gave me a great foundation in the works of classic philosophers working in ontology. It provided me with new insights into what I want to do with my own research and career. ",
            "\u00a0The course basically starts with Aristotle's notions of substance, quality/relation, and topics and then follows the thread of those sorts of interests through a bunch of different thinkers. I would say it gives you some really fascinating theoretical tools for thinking about the material world around you and for thinking about process. In some sense, you are really focusing on people who are trying to push processes of meaning \"down\" from the human into the material. The interest in material things, relations, and process is constant even though you read quite a broad group of people. So whether you read Marx, Heidegger, Whitehead, or Evans-Pritchard, you're expected to look out for similar things. The knowledge covered would sometimes seem hard to integrate with everything else, and then Professor Kockelman would show surprising connections. You won't get an in-depth appreciation of all of the nuances of anybody's thought, but you will get a very cool notion of semiotic process as a broadly applicable and productive way of reading many Western thinkers and thinking about the material and theoretical world. By the end of class the whiteboard would look insane, with diagrams and arrows and poorly drawn stick figures, just to give an idea of the direction of the course. "

            "\u00a0Strengthsit is definitely a very unique course which will never get boring. The reading responses really force you to think hard and synthesize the various readings with each other. It is well-taught with seminar actually bringing a lot of insight and synthesis on top of whatever you were able to come up with before class. The class is also very fun. Class participation was pretty good, as long as people spoke, and Professor Kockelman always took our ideas very seriously.\r\nWeaknesses6 of 7 students in the seminar were white and 6 were men, so definitely not a lot of diversity. Also, it would definitely be too abstract for a lot of people or too intimidating, especially because you will really have to speak up if you don't understand something. And I didn't know everyone's names at the end of the semester. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course is different from any anthropology course I have ever taken and offers something incredibly interesting and unusual. It revived a feeling of curiosity about intellectual pursuits and the world around me. The course is taught in a fair manner with a reasonable workload. This course was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I took this class as a first-year with pretty much no preparation in linguistics or anthropology or philosophy, and loved it. Definitely requires you to pay a lot of attention and think in new ways, but it is cool in many ways. You get exposure to the engagement of a lot of interesting people with ideas of how meaning is constructed and how process happens, and an interesting framework to think about what the work of ethnography actually is on these terms.
