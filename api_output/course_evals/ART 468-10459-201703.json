            "\u00a0The best part of this course were the open prompts that allowed me to develop my own ideas and direction for each of the projects that we were assigned. I was able to pursue different artistic avenues that I had never gotten the chance to, and it gave me confidence in bringing in various interests and backgrounds to the graphic design space. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths definitely lie in the open ended-ness of the projects, as well as the fact that there were only two major projects throughout the semester. I was able to go as far as possible on both, and had the freedom to iterate on my ideas for as long as I needed. There was also an opportunity to partner up with some art students at Shenkar University in Tel Aviv, which could have been very interesting but the times and projects didn't really line up as I had hoped. That was probably the weakest part of the course design, but it didn't affect how I felt about it overall. "
