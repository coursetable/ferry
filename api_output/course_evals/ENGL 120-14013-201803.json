            "\u00a0I became a better writer and enjoyed the company of other people interested in writing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved so much more than I thought it could, both academic and personal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use my voice to create original work in the class. Using essays from other accomplished writers, I was able to fix the wordiness/awkwardness of my sentences and elaborate my sentences and ideas efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0I perfected the craft of writing an essay and learned of the styles of the great writers of all time. I am now better read and knowledgeable in advanced literature. I also learned how better writing applies to all subject matter and how to get over writer's block. ",
            "\u00a0Important structural modes for writing various kinds of creative essays; various tools to consistently improve writing; an array of resources to help inspire writing ",
            "\u00a0I gained techniques for writing creative non-fiction ",
            "\u00a0This class completely changed the way I approach writing. English 120 taught me to creative writing as a craft, just like woodworking or painting. There are methods that can be used incorrectly, and there is a \"writer's toolbox\" at your disposal if you know how to use it correctly. Even if you're a STEM major like me, and don't plan to use creative writing in your job someday, your writing will still radically change after taking this class! We learned how to write personal essays, write about places, people, cultural issues, and even comedy. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I understood how to write rudimentary, formulaic essays. After having taken this course, I understand the complexities of how to structure an essay with a far greater degree of sophistication. This course has also helped me clean up my writing on a line-by-line basis. I've already found myself drawing on the skills from English 120 in my other courses and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to express what I am feeling in a way that accurately represents my experience. I learned how to structure narratives and arguments effectively. "

            "\u00a0The workshop component of the course is very strong. I wish we had more opportunities to workshop. ",
            "\u00a0Great organization of the course. Sometimes Professor Green pushed back deadlines but was a bit disorganized about it and didn't always update us quickly on when the new due date was, or didn't open the submission portal until an hour before the deadline. That was the only sub-optimal thing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were in the way the professor set up ground rules very subtly in the first class. Students were not allowed to nitpick on wordchoice, judge grammar, or judge a person's writing style they were just allowed to say what worked and give suggestions on how to improve. This allowed for light, but helpful workshops where the students felt comfortable revealing their mistakes and getting feedback. Overall, students were allowed to express themselves and their personality in class and more importantly in their essays. The only weakness is that we didn't meet more often it was an incredibly fun class to be in. ",
            "\u00a0I think the articles curated for this course and the writing assignments were intensely thought provoking, insightful, and honestly fun to read/write. We read a really large range of articles that provided a great jumping off point for discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the small group and the highly engaging topics that the essay's covered. A couple of the pieces were so interesting I ended up sending them to friends and writing responses to in my free time. And I am a prospective STEM major. The timelines for papers and reading was also very manageable. The course is really great the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: organized; involved: interactive\r\nWeaknesses: behind schedule ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps more time spent in class on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great because it is small enough such that each student gets a lot of attention and help from the professor. Professor Green gave extremely thorough and helpful feedback on each and every essay, and was always encouraging us to meet with him one-on-one to discuss the essay. The class also has workshops for each essay, allowing students to receive feedback about their essays from other students. Everybody got to participate in workshop at least once. I can't really think of any weaknesses in this course, it's extremely well organized and well structured to help students. I guess the only thing is that there aren't enough sections for all the students who want to enroll, so lots of people don't get to take it. ",
            "\u00a0The great weakness of the course, in my opinion, is that we did not read enough. therefore, the examples of \"good\" essays were fairly limited, and if students took issue with one or more of them, we would tend to spend more time picking the essays apart as a means of quibbling with their inclusion on the reading list rather than as an analysis of technique. \r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that this course requires such a high volume of writing is very helpful. The only way to write better is to practice, so writing and perfecting five essays with the Professor's (and sometimes the class's) feedback is the most helpful part of English 120. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course does well in providing a variety of prompts that appeal to different people's strengths and weaknesses. the workshops encourage peer feedback and normalize the idea of asking for help. I think a weakness is inconsistency between sections--other friends in ENGL 120 had differing prompts and each professor had different expectations of the students in terms of content and sentence structure.

            "\u00a0Yes! It was incredibly fun to take this course! Your writing improves and the class is really good at creating a community of students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The workload is not big at all; you read a few nonfiction essays each week, which are fun and interesting, and write 5 fun essays. Professor Green makes the course fun and chill, but you learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I have been telling anyone who would listen about Professor Green's class. He not only created an environment where students wanted to come to class every day and share their work, students could visibly see their growth in the class. Because he was strict but not too strict on deadlines students wanted to turn in their best work. 100% you will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think it was good to get to understand college writing, and also to expand the breadth of my repertoire. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend.  It is a lot of writing, but enjoyable writing. The skills learned are essential to being a college student. ",
            "\u00a0Any student who is interested in essay writing or in becoming a better writer in general should take this course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is a must for anyone who wants to improve their writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! You won't regret it! STEM students: if you're looking for a writing credit, take this one! Although it's more work than some other one-or-two-essay writing credits out there, it's way more fun and you'll learn so much. I looked forward to writing my essays because they were a nice change of pace from psets and they were one of my only chances to be creative. This class renewed the excitement for storytelling that I had as a kid. Make sure to try to get Prof Green! He's awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For everyone, no matter what major or track, writing well is an essential skill. English 120 is an exceptionally good way of perfecting writing skills, and the lessons learned in English 120 can be translated into writing for any field. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Writing effectively is an important skill in ever profession, and making your writing interesting makes you more versatile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof Green is great. One of the most engaging and fun classes I've taken. Professor and class matters so much for english 120, shop around for a section you like. If you get a chance to take one of prof green's class I would recommend. "
