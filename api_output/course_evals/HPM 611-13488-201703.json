It would help students to solidify the concepts from class, review the homework, and clarify anything we didn't understand before stepping up a level the next week. \r\n\r\nIt often felt like \"the blind leading the blind\" when doing the homework as a group and then deciphering our grade afterwards. TA office hours were packed and often didn't answer our base level questions, so we stopped going. ",
