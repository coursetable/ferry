Professor Guinnane knew how to keep us engaged and teach us beyond the readings, instead of just rehashing them. \r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n- minimum requirement of paper responses by a certain date\r\n- another pset maybe... thought doing that was extremely helpful \r\n- require attendance and make it part of the grade ",
            "\u00a0Small class size was great, some of the topics could use a little bit more structure / modeling ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The focus on five graded response papers that were meant to be concise, but communicate the main points of the paper really increased my engagement in the course. The papers also allowed me to improve my writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class might be improved if sessions were more focused on ideas being discussed students instead of the current Q&A structure.

One suggestion would be, given that the syllabus attracts less quantitative majors, some sort of supplemental review material to accompany the more quantitative readings. Some of the papers with more serious models were tough to grasp. ",

Although I like most people were originally interested in the class for the light workload, I ended up learning a lot from it. Prof. Guinnane is an interesting instructor. ",
