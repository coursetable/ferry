            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class about law and its intersection with tech and society. Reading actual cases helped me figure out how to parse legal jargon and begin to understand the complexities of the law as it's applied. I found the material in the class extremely relevant, timely, and applicable. This class also taught me to decipher complicated arguments with many conflicting viewpoints and helped me develop my own voice when writing in response to those viewpoints. ",

            "\u00a0THIS CLASS WAS AMAZING! Brad is so energetic and makes the material relatable to events at Yale and events going on in pop culture and makes it so you want to go to class every day and do the readings. I learned so much about law and intellectual property and internet law something I had little to no knowledge about and often wondered. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a minimal amount of law. The class was essentially students providing their input on the week's readings with some stories from the instructor. There was not much concrete learning occurring, rather we talked about issues with the law and technology. I wish the course went more into depth. ",

            "\u00a0The course was a good overview of interesting topics that are and will be relevant over the next few years. Copyright is discussed in great (perhaps too much detail) and other things such as net neutrality or right to anonymity online are discussed as well. ",
            "\u00a0An ability to analyze ethical questions regarding technological advances through an informed and critical lens, and a greater understanding of law. Very useful class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is, for most people, an introduction to the US legal system. That it covers cyberlaw and tech culture is an added bonus, but this is really Law, Tech, & Culture, in that order, emphasis on the law.\r\n\r\nAs such, we learned to read court cases (and analyze them), to think about the law, and apply the law to the digital world around you.

More specifically I gained a real understand of copyright law, what exactly net neutrality means, defamation vs free speech/protected speech, privacy and other important concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I gained critical thinking skills in this course, as Brad often encouraged us to form our own opinions on situations and challenge our beliefs. I gained knowledge in several areas including law, sociology, computer science, and psychology. Current events were tied into the lessons and I gained greater insight into the problems facing our society today concerning  present laws. In the reading responses I was able to determine potential solutions to these issues. During class the opinions of other students and the information Brad provided allowed me to look at controversial situations in ways I never had before. ",

            "\u00a0There was a lack of feedback especially early on in the course on the reading responses. Other course requirements were often times vaguely explained in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself is very interesting, and Brad is very charismatic, but the combination of the amount of reading assigned and the amount of reading actually discussed can be a little discouraging, especially when you're devoting two and a half hours, only able to complete half of the readings, and then nothing you read about was discussed in lecture. Additionally, the lack of any kind of discussion section made it very easy to not do the readings--not because of any lack of interest in the subject, but just because when you have so much other work, the reading begins to look more and more optional. I ended the class having wished I had done more of the readings. \r\n\r\nThe grading system was extremely problematic. I did not receive any kind of grades on my reading responses before the midterm, which functioned as a kind of long reading response, and so had absolutely NO idea what to expect or if my way of interpreting the readings/class content was correct. ",
            "\u00a0Class sessions quickly devolve into students throwing absurd hypothetical at Brad, after he's posed the \"question\" of each class - doing the reading was 95% of my learning from the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class, so the only thing I can think of to improve it is maybe a bit more transparency earlier in the semester about the requirements for the final projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course had very engaging lectures and material, but could have been better organized. All in all, a very rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0The class is poorly organized, grading is ill-defined. The readings are interesting but the classroom discussion is stilted. Professor Rosen seemed at times more interested in making his own points than in responding to intellectually interesting challenges from students. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interactive and the ULAs and TA were very accessible. I just wished that Brad would relate the lectures more to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class is always fun \r\nWeakness: the instructor posts the reading the morning of the day before class making it truly impossible to read all 20+ articles and write an argumentative reading response. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: low workload, readings/topics covered are very interesting, Brad is hilarious and engaging and clearly very passionate about the material\r\nWeaknesses: barely any of the readings are actually discussed in class -- there were several classes during which we did nothing but watch YouTube videos, like FULL-LENGTH youtube videos, of 7-8 songs to explore their relation to copyright or whatever (sorry Brad, but doing this is what makes lecture optional, not mandatory), the same 5 people (who do little but grandstand) are called on repeatedly during lecture so even if you have something to say, too bad, grading expectations are very, very unclear ",
            "\u00a0The discussion and topics covered are great. Sometimes I feel like points are belabored and everyone in the class gets what you are saying even if they do not agree. ",
            "\u00a0VERY good cr/d, but I personally would not recommend taking this for a grade as it is incredibly difficult to get above a B+/A- without putting in tons and tons of extra effort with Brad. It's also difficult to know where you stand at the end of the course grade-wise. However, you learn a lot about the nuances of technology and how it intersects with the law when ethical dilemmas arise which is very valuable information, so I would recommend going to class if you do take it cr/d. Also Brad is absolutely hilarious and makes learning fun, so you'll want to go. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brad is the best goddamn lecturer, hands down, I have had at this institution. Material is super interesting, lecture is a great time, not too much work. Take-home midterm is tricky and takes a long time (many many hours; ~4500 words) but also super fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a ton of readings, and they are posted very late. Most weeks I didn't have time to do all of the readings before class, which was fine, because we never discussed all of them. But it would be a good idea to block off a few hours before class, the day of, to go over the readings. Grading is slow, but not harsh, so that's not a huge issue. Final class project is kind of dumb (make a video with ~100 people?!?!?) and doesn't do much on the educational front.\r\n\r\nNeither a strength nor a weakness, but very important depending on who you are as a student: homework assignments consist of handing in five reading responses throughout the semester, and you cannot do two in the same week. Start them as early as possible, because otherwise the last month of classes will run up very quickly and you will be cramming to do responses. However, these responses are INCREDIBLY open ended. Literally write about whatever you want. I wrote a story for one. You can ramble, as long as its organized rambling. People have submitted memes (and gotten good grades). ",
            "\u00a0The course is so interdisciplinary in nature, and unlike anything else you will learn at Yale! Very modern topics and updated syllabi that incorporate current events debates. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm is excruciatingly long, and the expected readings are way too long, which lowered my engagement in this class because it was so hard to get through all the material. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. Perhaps readings could be discussed more clearly in lecture and material that is expected to be understood could be expressed more directly. Otherwise, the course was exciting and extremely well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nAmazing professor \r\nSuper interesting material\r\nThe style of class was exciting \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWork not return in a timely fashion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Flexibility (no set due dates for reading responses), take-home midterm, the ability to voice opinions and ask questions in class that facilitate class discussion, amazing professor \r\nWeakness: Time it takes for reading responses to be returned ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic for how relevant the information is and for Brad's ability to bring the information alive. ",
            "\u00a0Lacks structure ",
            "\u00a0strengths: engaging lectures and really interesting course material\r\nweaknesses: I found the undergraduate TAs (ULAs) to be quite distracting during lecture as they frequently liked to chime in with their input ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a range of fascinating and incredibly relevant topics surrounding the law and technology/use of the internet that would be valuable to any student. I loved how it was a small lecture but still was able to have class discussion at every meeting. The only weakness I think in the course was that sometimes the readings were posted very late, making it difficult to complete the readings and write a reading response before the 10 pm deadline before next day's class. ",
            "\u00a0There was not as much cohesion in the course material ad Brad claimed there would be. Everything was interesting, but I don't think everything ended up connecting to strongly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Enthusiastic instructor, relevant learning material\r\nImprovements: Better communication, more structured lecture ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! \r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor!!! Interesting material, manageable work load, fair grades\r\n\r\nCons: Some of the material, while very interesting, gets pretty technical and complex. Brad does a terrific job explaining everything, but you really have to attend lectures to avoid confusion. "

            "\u00a0Definitely an interesting course. Expect to put a fair amount of time into it though if you want to really learn and engage with the material (especially around the midterm). The lectures are definitely highly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested, definitely at least shop the class. Brad's teaching style is not for everyone, something he makes very clear from the beginning, but if it works for you and you're interested in the material, the class is really engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, especially if you are interested in the law, or think maybe you might one day want to apply to law school. But if you want to get anything at all out of this course, do not treat it like a gut. The midterm is not a great experience if you haven't done a lot of the readings throughout the first part of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good overview of the subject matter, but class time could be used much more effectively.  It's a lot of dense reading, and trying to \"skim\" isn't really an option. ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should take this class before they graduate. Professor Rosen gives brilliant insights into the intersections of our current law and today's technology and illuminates many issues and 'loopholes' that need to be addressed. This class impacted the way I view myself as a citizen and the way I interact with technology. It's amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it, and in fact keep trying to get people to take it. The lectures are amazing and the material is super interesting, and while there can be a lot of reading, it's never so much that it feels overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but make sure to really do all the readings, because otherwise you won't get much out of the lectures. It is really interesting material and is a very unique class. ",
            "\u00a0There is a kind of student for whom this course would be good. Shop it. If you have any doubts, leave. Don't stick with the course because you are amused, only stick with the course if you are actually interested in the material. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! It is a great 5th class and requires little work other than 4 reading responses, a take home midterm, and a class project that is a funny video you only need to spend an hour on. This class and Brad are GEMS! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to an upperlevel student. There is not much work in the class, except reading responses. However I did not come out of the class feeling like I learned much because everything was broad and wasn't fully explained. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. The topics and Brad are dope, but this class is fraught with the issues that plague most lectures at Yale (despite Brad's teaching style being a unique and exciting experience). The class has a VERY low workload until the midterm (which will consume three entire days of your semester), then it again has a very low workload -- it's inconsistent. Grading of reading responses is slow and often contradictory (sometimes I lost points for failing to acknowledge counterarguments, but other times I lost points because including counterarguments \"detracted from the overall strength of my argument.\" Go figure.). The same 5 people who don't have much to say are called on again and again during lecture because they spoke up once during shopping period (how are you supposed to participate if you're never called on? Not everyone is comfortable circlejerking themselves into intellectual oblivion in front of 80 other people). Grading in general couldn't be more unclear (holistic grading is a courtesy most professors don't extend to their students, but I think it's possible to offer this courtesy without confusing everyone). Brad is great. The topics are great. The class is not great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes (if you like Brad. If you don't like him or his teaching style than don't because he is the class). This class is an outside the box course that covers great topics. I would recommend everyone that jives with Brad to take it and do at least most of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0YES - but as a cr/d! I personally would not recommend taking this for a grade as it is incredibly difficult to get above a B+/A- without putting in tons and tons of extra effort with Brad. It's also difficult to know where you stand at the end of the course grade-wise. However, you learn a lot about the nuances of technology and how it intersects with the law when ethical dilemmas arise which is very valuable information, so I would recommend going to class if you do take it cr/d. Also Brad is absolutely hilarious and makes learning fun, so you'll want to go. ",
            "\u00a0I would say this is a required class for anyone going into CS, thinking about law school, or both. Brad is an acquired taste (which you must acquire before shopping period ends), and this is really not the class for everyone. Brad will swear. He will call your ideas stupid, if they are stupid. He will gladly cold call you. He will yell, but he will also laugh (insert protecc/attacc/etcc meme).\r\n\r\nBut you will love this class dearly.\r\n\r\nDo the readings.\r\n\r\nPut in the effort: it's really not that much. ",
            "\u00a0This class really isn't worth the hype. For those of us who actually did do the reading, you learn a lot about the law that surrounds things like copyright and online privacy, but the class itself, while fun, doesn't teach you very much. I definitely regret taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this class. It has a bit of a varied reputation, but it's one of the few classes that I'm definitely going to retain information from effortlessly. ",

            "\u00a0Definately. The professor does an amazing job of explaining the issues and the material in a way that enables students to clearly understand the concepts and law. It was incredibly enjoyable and informative. Whatever you are interested in or planning to major in this is definately a class you should take. ",
            "\u00a0Brad Rosen is a veritable treasure. His course is one of the most remarkable I've ever taken, and he truly has a gift in teaching. He is a fabulous part of the Yale community. ",

No previous knowledge of law or computer science is necessary and regardless of how mundane these topics may sound, Brad makes them interesting, relevant, and exciting to learn about. The ULAs are very knowledgable and are always willing to help you. ",
