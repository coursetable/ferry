            "\u00a0I learned how to write a lab report, and how to run experiments in fluid and thermal labs. ",
            "\u00a0Learned laboratory techniques for wind tunnels, ball drop viscometry, solar panels etc. More importantly, I further developed my technical report writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0The lab improved my writing greatly. I havent practiced it much and havent done too much with technical reports but the lab was set up well to teach how to write each section of a technical report correctly and improve through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Lab skills. Writing skills ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class for visualizing fluids principles in action with the different experiments, and in the latter half of thermo principles too. "

        [
            "\u00a0The labs are interesting and generally provide accurate results. The feedback on reports was good and I felt like I learned a lot about scientific writing. It is a fair amount of work and sometimes the labs can get hard. Also most of the grade banks on the last report, so it is hard to know where your grade stands in the middle of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall the course was good with some very cool labs.  Biggest weakness was very inconsistent feedback.  Feedback was pretty light on first several labs, but then all of a sudden was very heavy on last few.  I doubt I was able to improve on all that additional feedback in just one or two more labs.  Give more feedback earlier, everyone likes to see themselves improve. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of interesting labs and was one of my favorite mechanical engineering classes. The two major problems were that the grading system was very opaque, and it wasn't clear how feedback on lab reports early in the semester would effect the final grade. Additionally, the final lab on the internal combustion engine was the one that was expected to have the highest quality writing but was simultaneously the hardest from a data analysis perspective. Since students are already overloaded with work during finals period, I think it would be better to move this experiment earlier in the semester so that students can focus on writing a great final report instead of getting bogged down with data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-taught. We got our graded reports the next week of class. Labs were straight forward - lab manuals were very clear and the instructors were really good at getting us set up on each experiment so there was never any confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe improve on boring labs such a Torricelli and ball drop ",
            "\u00a0I liked that Dr. Bose was a secondary professor providing more detailed feedback on labs. Especially considering his real-world experience, he was a great addition. However I don't think he and Professor Brown were in great communication in that I think they were looking for slightly different things in the lab reports. I would have liked if their feedback was more of a collaboration. "

            "\u00a0Probably only if they have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Basically, the only people that take this class are ABET mechE majors. There aren't really any other students except BS12s who have the prereqs to do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to other mechanical engineering students who dont necessarily have to take it. With Eric Brown, it was done very well, much better than it was in the past with other instructors. Its a good writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Don't do it if you don't have to ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a pretty good class. The weekly lab reports are a lot, but you learn a lot and it's certainly not impossible to handle. "
