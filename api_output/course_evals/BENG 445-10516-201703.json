            "\u00a0Lots of skills for biomedical image processing and analysis, mostly.  Ranging from the relatively simple stuff, such as edge detection, fourier transforms, blurring, to more complicated things such as image registration and segmentation.  It helped me a lot towards my senior project, which is on very similar material. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about Fourier transform, 2D rigid motion, segmentation, calculus of variations, filtering and others, which are quite advanced in imaging. "

            "\u00a0This was a very enjoyable and informative course. I liked that algorithms were explained explicitly so that the logic behind different processing techniques was clear. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course and I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nIf there was a continuation of this course (one in which we develop more computer algorithms/programs and receive help in doing so), it would really help solidify the theoretical knowledge I gained in this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but keep in mind that pretty much all the people in this class were graduate students, with only a handful of undergrads.  I would recommend taking Biomedical Signals and Images before this, as material from that class helped significantly towards this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would very much recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Would definitely recommend, but prepare to do a lot of math and programming. There was not much help with writing the MATLAB scripts and functions. ",
