            "\u00a0We learnt about physiological processes and their molecular and cellular disruption leads to different diseases in humans. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the specifics of how different channels, pumps, and pores affect the body. We focused predominately on how mutations in certain channels are responsible for different pathologies. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how the molecular integrity of various proteins is critical for their proper function and maintenance of homeostasis. We learned about the roles of such proteins in various tissues/organs, so it was very comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about disease and how it develops. In particular, the molecular underpinnings diving the pathology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about molecular physiology, specifically proteins and ion channels. Much of the class was devoted to clinical examples followed by explanations of the molecular underpinnings of the disease/disorder. I really appreciated learning more about these relevant subjects, because these topics might end up being useful for my future in medical research. "

        [
            "\u00a0Having a clinician (Prof. Boulbaep) teach the class was nice because it added a clinical competent to the study of the ion channels, cellular processes etc. We covered quite a lot of topics. Additionally, it was also nice having some guest lecturers for a few classes. Prof. Takizawa's lectures were excellent! Our TA was responsive and kept us updated. ",
            "\u00a0One of the major strengths is that Professor Boulpaep is extremely knowledgeable about the material he's covering. All of the exams and assignments were very fair and were focused on applying the knowledge covered in lectures. One weakness is that sometimes the lectures ran long in order to go through all of the material Professor Boulpaep wanted to cover on that specific topic. ",
            "\u00a0The paper discussions were sometimes a little rushed, so maybe a couple of figures can be selected ahead of time to focus on (ie discuss two or three figures in depth rather than rushing through five or six figures) ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness was the lack of TA involvement. Formal review sessions and/or discussions would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the breadth of information and the degree of detail offered by Prof. Boulpaep. He really tried to relate the information back to clinical cases, and this was explained in good detail. One weakness might be the issues associated with revealing too much information. Sometimes, this information was not relevant and more detailed (e.g. name/structure of receptors) than I would expect. However, I also appreciate learning this material to this high degree of detail. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was nice learning about the cellular processes behind diseases, and good learning about the diseases first to put things into perspective. We had four primary articles to read during the course of the semester and had good discussion about them. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course is extremely well taught and the exams are quite fair, but you do really need to show up to the lectures. The lectures are the main focus of the course. There's no textbook and the exams are completely based off of the material covered in the lectures. The exams are not regurgitating facts but rather understanding and applying concepts learned in class. Besides the 2 exams, there are 4 paper discussions which are 1 page summaries of papers assigned to us. The workload is pretty light and if you pay attention/show up, the material is taught in a way that's easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student (undergraduate and graduate) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone who is interested in learning more about the molecular drivers of disease should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Boulpaep makes this course very engaging and interesting. The topic is very interesting especially to pre-health students. I truly appreciated the level of attention paid to clinical cases and clinical examples. "
