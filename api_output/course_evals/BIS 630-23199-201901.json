            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course. It was challenging but homework assignments helped me a lot to understand the concept. I also liked the applied structure of the homeworks, since some other courses was not keeping their promises for the \"applied\" part. I appreciated that we've been given more than one software applications for the analyses. The course load was heavy but I still liked the course. The assignments were evaluated in a very timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture notes are very helpful for understanding knowledge. Hope sample exams could be provided before the exam. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think the course was a great learning experience. We covered a lot of material in each class but it was clear and easy to understand. My biggest critique of the course was that exams did not have an appropriate point distribution. I think it was absurd that if you did not understand one concept you could be in jeopardy of losing close to 25 points on an exam which is immediately a drop in two letter grades. I think the points should be more even or that some questions that were described as nominal should not have such a heavy grading. I also think it would be helpful, if there was a project, so that students can use data and have an abstract at the end of the course and be able to get feedback in the course. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course overall, and the instructor was very good about giving feedback and offering help outside the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe 2-hour long classes were just hard to sit through.... not because the lecture was bad but because no one can focus on a subject for that long ",
            "\u00a0This course is really logical and can let you know the core concepts for performing the survival analysis. ",
            "\u00a0It was excellent for a physician scientist who is trying to understand the basic concept of survival analysis as well as how to code for it and apply it to data. ",

            "\u00a0Very good materials for learning survival analysis. Good combination with coding materials and instructions.\r\n\r\nVery detailed explanation to the course materials. Good teaching pace and material structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topic is highly relevant for MPH and PhD students. it was highly relevant to CDE PhD students. Having the code in both SAS and R is excellent and helps students get through the software more easily. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course often deviated from the applied aspect to the theoretical aspects, which in these instances it becomes irrelevant for CDE students. This is demonstrated in that the first exam contained ~6 questions (worth around 30 points) just on calculus material that CDE students do not have experience/expertise on. Furthermore, as a PhD student in CDE, this course could have helped me move along my dissertation research. I have survival data that I could have used to learn all the concept, however, because this option is not available, a lot of my time was spent using hypothetical data. Being allowed to use real data would help me truly internalize the material and move along my own research projects. The opportunity to allow PhD students to use their own data for HW assignments as well as submit an extended abstract as a final paper (rather than exam) would greatly enhance the learning experience with survival analysis. This approach also allows the professor to provide real time feedback into actual research that students are conducting. Otherwise, most of the assignments for me were busy work. The final exam is easier, but also irrelevant to my education as a PhD student. I would benefit more from applying these concepts to my data and get feedback, than from memorizing formulas and steps for an exam. The former is more aligned with real world applications of survival analysis. ",
