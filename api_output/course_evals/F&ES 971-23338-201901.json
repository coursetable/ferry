            "\u00a0The lectures were amazing. We had someone come in each time and teach tangible, real life skills relating to land use planning, law, and development. For how few meetings there were, I think I learned a lot. ",

            "\u00a0I learned important applied skills related to land development and use law and policy. ",
            "\u00a0The clinical project helped me develop really great project management and time management skills. It also heightened my attention to detail and database management. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class because it allowed me to work with my own client for my capstone project -- I so appreciated Jessica's support through the process! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a clinic driven course and so much of the skills and insights come from working with the client and determining what type of product the client would like you to create. I learned a great deal about scoping a project and determining achievable outcomes during the allotted semester time.  Professor Bacher also does a great job using class time to talk about specific issues that students interested in land use issues are likely to experience. Her lectures on those issues and her use of guest speakers was incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about energy storage, which was the focus of the semester-long project I chose for the class. In addition, I gained more understanding of land use policies and decision-making processes locally, both through the class trip to Barcelona and through the course content and guest speakers. ",

            "\u00a0My project included evaluating a sea level rise tool, and, thus, I gained a deep understanding of how sea level rise actions can be carried out at the municipal and state levels. I also learned ways to engage the public when implementing local land use changes. Maybe the largest take-home message of this course, though, is how complicated it is to work with government documents and to use government websites and resources. ",
            "\u00a0The project I completed for this course required time management, organization, and analysis skills. I gained greater insight into the mechanics and abilities of local governments. ",
            "\u00a0A much improved understanding of land use planning processes, navigating these processes, appreciating municipality nuances, an introduction on how to do basic-level legal research, overview of several planning components and considerations from multiple public and non-public perspectives.

The project was interesting and good but I didn't love the project. I got a lot out of it for the time I put into it, but I definitely didn't spend as much time on it as I anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how diverse the projects were, and would have loved to hear more about what everyone was working on throughout the semester. The guest speakers were great! ",
            "\u00a0The field trip component of the course was incredible, getting to see land use practices in a different country was amazing and very insightful. Additionally, hearing from speakers that have international perspectives was also a good change of pace.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have been improved by adding more interactive activities with the class; the interactive sessions we did have seemed to really invigorate everyone and make everyone feel more connected to the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great guest speakers, very practical/applicable to real life, class trip that was well-aligned with the course and targeted to students' interests\r\nWeaknesses: Had some of the same speakers as the fall seminar (which was required to take the course) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was really well designed. The one piece of feedback that I have is about the final presentations. I really enjoyed hearing all of the different things that other students had been working on but thought that the presentations would have been more impactful had I been able to hear them over two lectures instead of one long lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the opportunity to apply what we were learning to a real-world city through the spring break trip to Barcelona was amazing! It was such a well-organized trip and did a great job of providing both an on-the-ground and higher-level understanding of the city's urban planning initiatives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the guest lecturers and class topics weren't relevant to my project or interests, which is always a challenge with a class as broad in scope as this one; it might be improved by tailoring some of the classes and speakers more directly to the project list/student interests. ",
            "\u00a0The course explored many different topics and provided a sampling of land use policy. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is also its weakness. I loved the freedom to choose the project I wanted to work on based on my interest from a wide selection of projects, but this meant that most of the lectures were only tangentially related to the work I did over the semester. I think that this is an impossible issue to fix in a class like this with so many different projects with substantially varied content happening at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Good lectures - hands on exercises were great. Projects could be more clearly scoped at the outset. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: hearing from guest speakers was extremely valuable, I appreciated the opportunity to choose a project that aligned with my interest, the project is a tangible accomplishment that I have been able to use to further my career goals.\r\nWeaknesses: this isn't necessarily a critique of the course, but it would have been nice to receive more regular feedback from the project client throughout the semester ",
            "\u00a0I like the current course format where students work on independent projects while attending classes / seminars on land use planning topics. The breadth of projects is impressive, and caters to several interests, with opportunities to work individually or collectively. "

            "\u00a0For me, this was not a final capstone class. It was a class that kind of got my feet wet in the arena of land use planning. It was a great learning opportunity.  Do the work up front to make sure you get the project that you want. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you have a project (either on your own or one of the ones from the project list) that you're really excited about, and find a good group. You'll learn as much as you put into it. ",
            "\u00a0Go on the field component if you can! Also, choose a project that really interests you and that you want to invest time in. ",
            "\u00a0Like other clinics, what you put in to this class is what you get out of it. Be prepared that clients sometimes are unable to give you time -- and you'll just have to roll with it. ",
            "\u00a0This clinic is great! Jessica does a wonderful job finding interesting projects and sprinkles useful classes about land use planning processes throughout the class. I really enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0Take it, and be sure to structure your project so that you have a clear deliverable early on (my group spent a little while trying to clarify what exactly we were going to be doing with our energy storage project). ",
            "\u00a0Don't be afraid of projects with a large scope ",
            "\u00a0Think carefully about what project you pick so that you ensure it's one that you really care about. ",
            "\u00a0Very good class. ",
            "\u00a0The project is what you make of it. Students are afforded a lot of independence in completing their projects and there aren't that many deadlines or specific requirements; however, if you put a lot of effort into your project, you will finish the semester with an extremely effective product that can align with your specific interests. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended for students interested in any aspects of land use policy or planning. STRONGLY advise students who are even remotely curious about the course to explore the list of student projects that is published at the beginning of the semester! Topics this year were vast and interesting, ranging from renewable energy, coastal resilience and management, equity and inclusion in planning, sustainable transportation, zoning, housing, environmental management, sustainability in cities, etc. The diversity of projects makes this course applicable and useful to all of the concentrations/specialization areas in some way.
