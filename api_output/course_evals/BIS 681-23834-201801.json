            "\u00a0The instructors provided well-prepared lectures, and were approachable and willing to spend time on interacting with students. The strength of this course was that it helped us, in a detailed way, to improve our writing and analytic skills. The lecture on journal publication and review was interesting. I would suggest that more topics (and advanced techniques) in real-world analyses and/or perhaps scientific research/publication be added to this course (since current lectures on missing data/confounding/study design etc were somehow overlapping what we learnt in other courses). ",
            "\u00a0Fairly OK, needs some improvements.\r\n\r\nI think the individual project is a great pressure for both instructors and students. The data constraints at the beginning were really stringent so many students were unable to find clinical data. Then the requirements of the data and proposal shifted which led to various projects forced to fit under one model. And the in the end, there were some students' projects are not in instructors' expertise so there were many back and forth. I know constructing a course from scratch is hard. Below are some suggestions. The form of the course can change. For example, provide some data source and potential directions for students in an area that the instructors are familiar with. In this way, the instructor could give in-depth comments on both writing and content. As for a consulting course, could add more \"consulting\" element. For instant, like the instructors did last semester, bring an actual client to the course and let students feel the consulting process. Or, introducing \"fake\" clients, and throw out some questions for students to answer. ",
            "\u00a0:( ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professors really cared about their students. I enjoyed their office hours and one-to-one meeting.\r\nImprovement: I would suggest a new format for this course. The idea originated from a site for data competition named Kaggle. The students can be assigned to different groups. They can have a semester to improve their prediction results and compete on the accuracy on Kaggle. At the end of the course, each team can have an opportunity to present their approaches and results. I hope this suggestion could contribute to the future development of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave us a chance to do an independent project and exposed us to fundamental concepts of clinical trial.\r\nHowever, most skills in this course is not so useful to the students in Department of Biostatistics. So I recommend to transfer this course from compulsory class to optional class. ",

            "\u00a0I can feel that all instructors are trying their best to improve this course and it is more effective than the last semester. But I still think this course is not so useful and should not last as long as one year. During this year, this course introduces several concepts and formulas such as PICO and sample size calculation. But it seems that the whole course is not well-organized. And for most students in biostatistics, such content is quite simple and should be finished in a few classes. Thus, in my opinion, this course could be compressed into one semester. And although it is called consulting lab, I do not think it taught so much about how to communicate with collaborators. We spent the majority of time in doing an independent work. ",
