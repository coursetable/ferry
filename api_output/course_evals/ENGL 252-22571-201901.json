            "\u00a0I learned a bit about comparing poetry and painting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a 20-page paper on Wordsworth and Constable. ",
            "\u00a0I now know an awful lot about William Wordsworth's life. I know a little about the 18th Century painters, and something about Byron's idea of the hero and what it meant to seek self-completion ",
            "\u00a0This course was an opportunity to become familiarized broadly with paintings of Constable and Turner, somewhat in the context of Wordsworth and Byron. Though one short paper helped introduce me to modes of writing about / interpreting visual art, the class as a whole lacked instructional structure, and I don't feel as if I've substantially improved my abilities to analyze literature and visual art. ",
            "\u00a0The course shows ways of making interdisciplinary connections between poetry and painting. ",
            "\u00a0More in-depth understanding of the poetry and art of the Romantic Era. Exposed to much more of the content produced during the period than I had ever been before. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course consisted mostly of weaknesses. The class was not really structured around any particular information: the professor just talked, and did not seem interested in students' attempts to participate. Most class meetings were 70-80% rambling lecture. The actual materials of the course were interesting, but I do not feel that I learned much of anything about them. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Professor Fry is very knowledgeable on the subject; you get what you put into the class. \r\nstrengths that other people may consider weaknesses: discussions feel more like lectures, Fry spends more than half the seminars going through a ppt of paintings ",
            "\u00a0I think this class would have been better as a lecture, because Professor Fry talks a lot, and its interesting, obviously, but the long format was too long, and it would have been better to listen to him for 50 minute periods. I would have been more engaged if this was the case. ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is the material: Turner, Constable, Wordsworth and Byron are all rich subjects for study. In moments when I did enjoy the class, it was because I enjoyed looking closely at a painting, or thinking of it in the context of greater literary meaning. But these moments were relatively few; for me, the class had far more weaknesses than strengths. (1) Though it was advertised as a seminar, there was virtually no discussion whatsoever; Almost the entire two hours was consumed in a rather unstructured lecture with no discernible direction / focus. This made the course not only uninteresting, but also needlessly difficult. There were extremely few chances for students to ask questions, discuss reading, or workshop their ideas. The sheer lack of discussion in this class was frankly remarkable. (2) The lectures, and general focus in this class, skew heavily towards painting and art history (even though it is not cross-listed). Given that it is advertised as a Junior Seminar in the English department, this (and the very shallow focus on close reading poetry) was surprising, and frustrating; I didn't have a background in Art History, but the tone of the professor and his syllabus seemed to assume I'd been studying British Romantic painting for years. ",
            "\u00a0This class could have had more student participation and more questions that were geared toward welcoming students into the discussion. I was glad to spend a few class sessions in the YCBA and enjoyed the organization of the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a seminar that, for the most part, is taught as a lecture. This style may work better for some rather than others, but I found it a time to relax and just enjoy looking at art and hearing someone else talk about what I was seeing and reading instead of having to always be analyzing and thinking in a seminar environment. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the sustained look at just four figures. The reading was manageable and the pairings were very interesting and provocative. I also loved the visits to collections around campus. "

            "\u00a0I wouldn't! ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're really interested in the very specific art that the class focuses on. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend this course, unfortunately. Though the subject matter carries so much potential, the seminar itself lacks a sense of direction and even the most basic means for students to engage & learn constructively. ",
            "\u00a0I don't recommend this class. Sure, it's an opportunity to be in the same room as an accomplished professor who clearly knows a lot, and cares a lot, about the material (and seems like a pretty nice guy). But if you are really, really excited about that prospect, I suggest you find a nice tree, sit beneath it, and read Wordsworth on your own time--maybe go see Professor Fry during his office hours, if you want to pick his brain. This class is not worth your time. Professor Fry talks for almost all of the seminar, but never with a specific argument or strong message. He asks very few questions, and when he does, he always seems to be searching for particular \"correct\" answers. His actual opinions and way of looking at paintings/analyzing poetry are not very helpful, and are very different from what you'll learn in most classes. He seems to have very little grasp of basic pedagogy (although this is true of many professors). I have never gotten so little out of a class. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on what you are looking for in a class. I found this to be a very laid-back environment where I could just enjoy whatever it was we were looking at, poetry or painting, and start to make connections between the two. It is a nice 5th class with low-stakes class to class work, but still the same amount for papers and final projects as other classes. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. "
