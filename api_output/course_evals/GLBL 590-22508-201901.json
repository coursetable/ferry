            "\u00a0This course helped understand the breadth of what \"cyber\" can mean, whether in terms of interstate conflict, espionage, or non-state actors.  The modules were diverse enough to help us appreciate the nuances of different applications of cyber capabilities to statecraft, and the readings in each module were detailed enough to help us appreciate the most salient features of these capabilities.  I feel much more conversant in the challenges that cyber capabilities pose to governments and organizations in the present as a result of taking this course. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n    o Excellent range of topics--clearly delineates all of the possible manifestations of what is colloquially called \"cyber\" in policymaking \r\n    o Instructor engagement with students was exceptional--professor understood what students were interested in and, at least in my case, went out of his way to ensure that out-of-class writing and research assignments nested with my final paper and long-term research objectives\r\n    o The students--simply phenomenal cross-section of capabilities and experiences from across the campus.  We had technical, legal, military, and policy expertise in the room to selectively bring to bear on the topics under discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n     o Student policy papers: this assignment was good, but very often the students who had written the paper for discussion in any given week had to scramble in the last couple of minutes of class to present their recommendations.  Would recommend perhaps letting these students lead the class as a stage-setter. "

            "\u00a0Yes--this course is an excellent initiation into understanding how cyber capabilities--offensive, defensive, and espionage--operate at a technical level, and how they influence state-on-state relationships.  The course also helps understand the non-state applications and associated risks of cyber capabilities.  Very practical choice for anyone who aspires to be a relevant leader in any sector. "
