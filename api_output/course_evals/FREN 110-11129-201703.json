            "\u00a0SO MUCH. You learn so much practical french in this class, it is just amazing. I came in knowing so little french but this class gives you the knowledge to not only carry a conversation but take it in the direction you desire. you learn how to speak correctly and with as much cultural idioms as possible. ",
            "\u00a0I can now moderately understand french videos.  Although I took french in high school, this course still managed to push my skills to greater heights. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to speak, read and write French. This includes several tenses,lots of day to day vocabularly and lots of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the constant amount of work, I do feel as though I learned much in the way of the french language. However, I do also feel that the course was too hard for an intro to language course. "

            "\u00a0This course builds itself off of the program \"French in Action.\" Although we have learned a lot from the lessons, we are learning very specific details tailored towards only what we see in the videos. The videos are great, but it would have been nice to learn a wider scope of vocabulary. I really enjoyed learning the tenses. The irregular verbs could have been taught in a more organized manner. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this is great ",
            "\u00a0Too much work at times, but i understand why, it helps you learn so much.\r\nthe quizzes were so hard\r\ni liked the audio portion of the quizzes because it forces your Brian to learn how to respond quickly in a different language.\r\ni was always so lost on Tuesdays, i wish we were allowed to read the video scripts before so that i can actually follow what's happening. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a lot of work, but it is very worth it.  The course is well-designed.  There is a lot of homework. ",
            "\u00a0I like the method of followind a story to learn the language. I also like the class setting and group discussion. I dislike how the test every week are outside of class time. They would be fine if they were in class tests. ",
            "\u00a0The constant homework seemed to do little in the way of helping. Going over the videos we watched helped the most. It gave me an understanding of real world uses of the french language. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this program is great for students even if they do not have any experience with French. It is very fast paced, but if you do the work, then you will indeed learn french. The workbook helps a lot of with the rules and exceptions. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0Ofcourse! just make sure you have enough time to actually commit to learning it, this is no joke. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is a great introduction to reading, writing, and especially speaking the french language.  However, the course moves very fast, and it may be hard at times to keep up.  The baseline amount of homework is already high, and if you are struggling, it means you need to put in even more work.
