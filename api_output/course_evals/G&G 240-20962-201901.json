            "\u00a0You learn a lot about how to read scientific papers and assess the validity of assumptions made my scientists  you become a critic of scientific literature, basically. You also learn about seismology, geochemical processes, and other forensics topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a strong introduction to the basic principles of geophysics, geochemistry, and geoforensics, including seismology, isotope geochemistry, and other techniques. Perhaps the most useful skill I gained in this course was the ability to effectively analyze and interpret primary scientific literature in a discipline with which I was previously unfamiliar. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to present information to the class, and answer questions of the technical aspects of various techniques, which helped really solidify my understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course! Actual scientific knowledge gained really depends on how much you put into the course outside of class, but I thought I gained a much better sense of how to evaluate scientific claims, and some general fun facts about forensic geoscience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a wide variety of geoscientific methods and topics ranging from drug provenance to fossil fraud. I also learned how to read a scientific paper and how to write an analytic literature of my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about geology and geoscience. ",
            "\u00a0So many! This class is an ideal model for a science credit aimed at non-majors. It will create more thoughtful students in the disparate fields they pursue post-graduationlaw, government, journalism, businessand, in the process, introduce them to the Yale G&G departments important work, as well as increase their understanding of and appreciation for science in general. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing!!! Professor Long taught us all about the different methods of forensic geoscience in order to solve exciting cases of our time! Think narcotics provenance, polonium poisoning, and the balloon bombs of WWII! ",
            "\u00a0This course was so helpful to me as a non-STEM major. I learned to read and critique scientific papers and articles, which was a skill I really struggled with before. I learned parts geoscience, a subject I hadn't studied before, but the main takeaway for me was learning to read through scientific jargon to understand a paper to a level where I felt comfortable making critiques. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about different methods and cases of forensic cases. Learned how to read and think critically about scientific studies. "

            "\u00a0If you're looking for an easy but interesting science credit, this is 100% it. You have two reading responses per week, which can just be questions about things you didn't understand from the reading, and they're graded complete/incomplete. All but like three classes are student presentations about the readings. So, you pick your topic at the beginning of the year, and you present on the readings for that day (the TA will help you understand it). Otherwise, every class you listen to the ~40 minute presentation and then engage in a discussion about the readings which are always super interesting. There's a term paper, but you get to get feedback on a draft before the final. That's it  super chill class, Maureen is FANTASTIC and the grading is super fair on everything. 100% recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really amazing- it definitely ranks among my favorite courses at Yale! I loved the small, seminar format of the class, which, as a STEM major, I know is particularly rare among STEM classes. I'd love to see more of these seminar style courses offered as an introduction to different STEM departments- much like Forensic Geoscience was my introduction to G&G. The course was well-set up to facilitate learning, and I learned so much from  both my peers and from Dr. Long regarding the techniques used in the case studies, the underlying science, and the policy implications. I thought all the case studies were truly interesting, and really looked forward to every class meeting. I also found it super empowering to have the students give the case study presentations, giving us all a chance to deep dive into the material (with a lot of great support from Dr. Long and the TA, Anwar). \r\n\r\nThere were honestly very few weaknesses of this course. Professor Long was extremely well organized and prompt/clear in her feedback and expectations, which made the administrative side of the course a breeze. The one thing that was a little frustrating at times was the variability in the time available for discussion at the end of the case study introduction. This would definitely be difficult to dictate (as the case studies were of differing complexity), but it would be nice to always reserve at least 20 minutes for discussion if possible (as the discussion was so interesting, and one my favorite parts of taking a seminar style science course). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Maureen and Anwar are both fantastic. Case studies are lots of fun. Very accessible to folk not coming from a scientific background, and you learn something. Class is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Almost all of class time (aside from ~4 lectures) is spent on student case study presentations, which are fine, but definitely much worse than a presentation from Maureen would be. I'd rather listen to her talk more and us talk less. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course is Professor Long, who is an absolute gem of the G&G department. Some of the units can get a tad repetitive, but I believe she changes them around every year. Because it's a seminar, the quality of the course is heavily dependent on the group you get; this year's was great, with a wide array of student majors and interests, which I believe Professor Long does intentionally. ",
            "\u00a0The course was especially for novices and people not familiar with science. ",
            "\u00a0The course is overall excellent, however, there should be hard and strictly enforced time limit on student presentations. No one wants to hear an undergrad talk for an hour about a topic they researched for less than a week. Presentations over a half hour were boring and inhibited class discussion, which was the best part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This was perfectly thought out, with great material and a reasonable workloadno weaknesses. It fully converted me to a distributional-requirements proponent because I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Exciting, different every day, fun, great and engaging teacher and TF\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0This course is really well organized for student learning. The bi-weekly exercises made sure everyone had done and engaged with the readings, and writing our final paper draft so early meant we actually learned from our mistakes and learned to write on science better than we had been. A weakness was that we ended up going over the same material a couple of times, because every student had to give a forty minute presentation and many included the same background information on how various methods work. I would say though that I found the first two readings the hardest, which made me feel pretty scared about the course, but the other readings were much more doable. Students also get to choose when the bulk of their work happens by choosing their preferred case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Fun topics and very involved professor. Class structure gets a little repetitive with all of the case studies, but overall an informative and well-organized course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are how much Maureen cares about her students and the workload is very manageable. I think that the presentations however could attempt to be about more engaging or at least mix up how we engaged with the material. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student. It's easy not in the sense that there's not intellectual challenge but in the sense that when things don't make sense you're not going to get a lower grade, you just ask her about it or question it in your writing  or bring it up in discussion and you figure it out as a class. If you're scared of the science credit at Yale, TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It is hard to get into (like 15 kids out of 120 this year got to take it), so look at the syllabus and see if your interests line up with the topics and mention that in your email asking to join the class. ",
            "\u00a010000% take this class if you are lucky enough to have the chance!!!!!! There's a reason it's so oversubscribed- Dr. Long is amazing and she picks the class really well, with lots of different perspectives represented in the room. This was an incredible course, where I learned a ton of totally new material with a very reasonable workload. It's definitely a real science class- you'll learn real, technical methods and read a lot of primary literature, so if that's not your thing, maybe look elsewhere. But if you want a small, seminar style class in STEM, this is an incredible one to take! It's a great way to learn a little about G&G through some awesome forensic case studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would, especially if you need a science credit. It's a very strong, interesting course, and you'll probably look forward to seminars. It's not a ton of work and it's not going to change your life, but you won't regret taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It may be difficult to get in, but it's a lot of fun. You learn a lot about so many different branches of geoscience, but it's never overwhelming. The work is backloaded toward the end of the semester, although Maureen gives a lot of great feedback and support. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is an intriguing science credit. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent, probably the best science credit available for non-science majors. The material is interesting and stimulating, but never unmanageable. The seminar format allows you to talk through content with peers and your grade is made up of reading responses, discussion participation, a presentation, and a 12 page final paper which you develop over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Please please take this class if you can! Maureen Long is spectacular, the material is engaging, and the class discussions were rewardingtruly a gem. ",
            "\u00a0This class was the best science credit I could have taken! There is always a way to tailor it to your needs and be engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially to non-STEM majors because Maureen and Anwar really help students of all levels understand to read scientific papers; because the class discussions make the materials more accessible and everyone can contribute regardless of background; and because the case studies are interesting in themselves whether or not you're in the class.
