            "\u00a0The course is great but sometimes there can feel like a small disconnect between the lectures and the psets/readings. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not very engaging and didn't help with the material much. It was hard to stay focused in them, and most students would give into their distractions and scroll through facebook the entire time. Most of the learning was out of the book, which is ok for some students, but I would have liked a little more in-class guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Course overall was taught pretty well. Office hours every night of the week helps a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs were helpful and informative during office hours, the textbook was also well chosen and easy to learn from. Reading quizzes and psets were generally well structured and conductive to learning and review. Due to the difficult nature of the midterms, they were graded on a fair curve and with lenient partial credit.\r\nWeaknesses: I attended every lecture for this class and got nothing out of any of them. Professor Emerson spent most of class time doing unhelpful (and often nonfunctional) polls and doing the same overly elaborate examples over the entire semester. Since he didn't spend any class time actually teaching the concepts (which I guess is to be expected out of a Yale math class), doing helpful and relevant examples, or actually answering questions (most questions were redirected to \"that's a great question for piazza\", \"that's a good question for TA lab hours\", \"let's do a poll on that\", or \"that's beyond the scope of this class\"), there was truly no reason to go to lecture. Furthermore the examples that he did do in class/from psets were never the types of questions that showed up in quizzes. Midterms and the final were almost impossible to study for since Professor Emerson would never directly tell us what would be on them and would instead sort of indicate what might be \"fair game\". Many of the things that he said were probably fair game but unlikely to show up would often show up on midterms in ways we'd never seen before, which was a problem since they were only 4 questions long and each one question a large percentage of the overall grade. Thankfully we were allowed a self-made \"cheat sheet\" for each exam, which just turned the exams into guessing games to see whether you happened to write down the formula you needed for any given problem. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it does not require any background in math. It will help you understand research in any fields you are interested in without burdening you with mathematical concepts you can't wrap your head around. That being said, it is sometimes frustrating for mathematically inclined students not to be provided with the math behind what is taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course is as good as a large easy intro-level lecture could probably be. A lot of self-teaching, which is probably better for some students than others. The format is the same throughout (psets and occasional assessment) which is nice. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured to be almost entirely self-taught. You are expected to read chapters off of a book written like it has a target audience is fourth graders in mind, and coming into lecture he spends most of the time talking about nothing and going over maybe one basic example. Going to lecture might help you further your understanding of certain topics, but you certainly wouldn't learn most of what is covered in the course. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very conceptual look at Statistics. Professor Emerson works hard to ensure students are always understanding and connecting things to the bigger picture. My only problem with the course was that there was not much review material for the midterm and final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the amount of support available to students (office hours mon-thurs nights), the difficulty level of the p-sets\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not always very engaging ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the availablity of the Professor and office hours. A weakness is how quickly the course moves. At some points the lectures felt disconnected from the chapters we read. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly did not find the lectures as helpful as they could be. The examples were rather unhelpful... This class kind of was caught between being a flipped classroom and not a flipped classroom which made for a weird set of lectures... Even the lectures themselves spent a little too long talking about the 'updates' of course logistics...' I would honestly prefer 2 lectures 75 minutes a week because that might allow for a better covering of course material ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be greater connections made between textbook content and class material. It felt like some of class time was spent on activities that did not further the goal of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Jay really makes sure that the class does not go to quickly and that it is accesible for people with no background in statistics (like me). He does some example problems in class that are helpful and assigns a very reasonable amount of homework. I also feel that overall the tests and grading were pretty fair, even if they were a little challenging at times. The main weakness was that the pacing of the class was a little off so that we had to learn like 4 chapters in the last week and weren't sure what portion of the new content would be on the test. ",
            "\u00a0Extra help was ALWAYS available for this class. Plus it focused on conceptual understanding instead of memorization, which made it infinitely more interesting and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Could move more quickly, spend less time on confidence intervals and more time on other skills entirely\r\n\r\nPsets were on the whole very instructive\r\n\r\nThe tests were a good measure of our knowledge, though they needed more points. Because the major assessments weren't  \"point-dense\" enough, committing small errors (such as missing a sign or making a math error) could lower the test score by 5% ",
            "\u00a0its boring and dry and borders on confusing \r\nstrengths - you learn basic statistics ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = the professor. Emerson is very interested in making sure all students understand what they do conceptually. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the generous amount of office hours that were provided. I took advantage of them because sometimes reading the textbook was not enough for me to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Engaged and enthusiastic professor\r\n-Office hours with TFs and ULAs\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Teaching of regression. The last section in the course was too rushed and not thoroughly explained like the rest of the materials. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was definitely the material and its insights. ",
            "\u00a0All of the office hours and extra help was immensely helpful. The instruction was clear in class. The lecture was always straight forward and clear. The material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I hope that in the future the course isn't so textbook heavy. Also, the daily office hours were great, but they should also vary in times they are held. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures were a weakness of this course. While Prof. Emerson was an engaging speaker, his lectures often had little to do with the material we were expected to know for the problem sets and often relied on extended examples that required a lot of set up for very little pedagogical value. I often left lecture confused as to what I had just learned, if anything at all. On the other hand, Prof. Emerson and the TFs made themselves hugely available, with somewhere in the range of 20 combined office hours every week. I wish I had taken better advantage of them, but even knowing that they were there made me feel supported. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were certainly the overall material. Personally, I found it very engaging and I appreciated the cumulative nature of the work. I believe some weaknesses include feedback on Problem Sets. As well, textbook reading assignments were occasionally unclear, especially when it came to regression at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is both a good introduction for those with no background in statistics and a good review with some thought-provoking questions for people who do have some background. A primary weakness is that the lecture material is neither correlated with the book readings nor crystallized into any kind of coherent takeaway. Sometimes a complicated example or computing problem was carried out with little relevance to the primary material that we were responsible for. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the problem sets were helpful. However, because the class was lecture style, I didn't feel as engaged as I could have been. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that jay is a great teacher and so engaging! Weaknesses is there needs to be more emphasis on the textbook in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The class was textbook heavy which could be a good thing or a bad thing. I felt that the lecture, while interesting real world problems, did not always relate to what was in the book or on the tests. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of TF help hours which were really beneficial, although some of the TFs and ULAs also didn't really know how to solve some of the problems or didn't have a great grasp of the concepts. The homeworks were really helpful for getting us to understand the mechanics of statistical inference, but didn't teach us much of the theory, and the tests were very heavily theory-based, which made the tests much harder. I felt that there could have been better preparation for the exams if we had focused less on just mechanics on the homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0The resources available throughout this course were really great. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the homework is very intuitive. A weakness is that the exam questions seem very different from the homework and in-class practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn a lot, great foundation for data analysis in other disciplines \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the testing material was unusual and discouraging ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved in at least two ways.  The first is that I wish we had spent a little bit more time going over how the probability rules translated to the later concepts.  The second is that during lectures we didn't review a lot of the material that we had assigned for reading.  I wish the lectures were slightly more focused and connected with the readings more.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the course were definitely the fact that it sought to give us an understanding of statistics as a whole, not just specific tests and formulas.  The course also had lots of help and opportunities to seek assistance, which was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is certainly the book and the professor. The book is really good is the professor is a great lecturer. However, I think it could be improved without the midterm right after spring break. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught and staffed, but it could be improved with more small group settings for students to learn in and earlier office hours (not 8-10pm). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs were great and office hours were very helpful. Though answers were not provided directly, we were expected to think through problems with instructors and they always tried to provide us with useful insights and information. Jay always made lectures fun and engaging. \r\n\r\nI believe that Jay could have done a better job of teaching us the material during lecture. During the first half of the semester, we would always start learning new material after almost half the class was over. The lecture runs for a short time but to get a better grasp of what is going on, lecture should run for a longer time. ",
            "\u00a0this class was a great intro stats class! i have never had stats before and the pace and scope of this class were ideal \r\nI wish we had covered just a bit more, as content felt repetitive some times ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: accessible teaching style and engaging lectures, clear textbook explanations, fair exams, extensive office hours by both professor and TAs.\r\nWeaknesses: slightly uneven pacing with a disproportionate amount of new material at the end. However, final exam was fair and dealt well with addition of new materials. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job at slowly building up difficulty and actually building on what we've learned over time, rather than throwing us into the fire as some other STEM courses are apt to do. I found the tests to sometimes be a bit surprising considering the types of homework questions we did, but otherwise thought the course was well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a multitude of help for struggling students.  However, I wish we would have covered a few more topics in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I was great in putting statistics in a real world context. It wasn't so great (and this in part cannot be helped) because as an introductory course, there were people of vastly different backgrounds and so the pace at which material was covered was occasionally too fast/slow. ",

            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to those who struggle with abstract thinking. The mechanical side of statistics weren't difficult, but the underlying concepts and their logic were kind of hard to grasp. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this to a student that might want to major is data science. Had I taken this class as a freshman, I may have chosen a different major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you have never taken stats before. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if you have no background in statistics.  If you do have any background in statistics, you should probably take a more advanced course.  That being said, if you have never taken statistics before, this class gives you a good foundation of the concepts, is not super concerned with the specifics of each formula or test, rather the whole picture, and gives you lots opportunities to get help outside of class.  If those are things you are interested in, definitely take the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested into developing a basic understand of the mindset of statistics. I learned the tools of statistics I needed to understand scientific papers in my other classes, and I plan on taking more stats classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great introductory course for stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that it would be a very useful course to those who require a QR credit or who want to receive a basic understanding of statistics and data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course--it is deeply flawed, to the point where my friends and I were consistently confused. It was deeply frustrating to put forth so much studying and feel like the exams did not reflect that knowledge. I studied 15+ hours for the final and for other exams and found them to be difficult. The lectures did not do a good job of covering material and often a lot of people were confused. Even though the class was supposed to be screened to ensure that there was no one in the class that had a leg up on everyone else in terms of knowledge of statistics, there were so many students in the class that were over prepared and would browse the web, code for their harder STEM classes, and make students like myself feel extremely stupid for struggling through the material and feeling like our efforts were not recognized. While Professor Emerson was cognizant of this, and applied a curve on an individual rather than class-based level, I still feel like it wasn't right for an intro class to have so many people that obviously didn't belong there and should have taken STAT 230. It was deeply disheartening and honestly this class turned me off of intro STEM classes forever. We also spent a handful of lectures working in R and then barely had to use R in p-sets or exams, which is a complete waste of time. The course felt like a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is so well organized and Prof Emerson is so extremely caring and gives amazing lectures and goes out of his way to make sure that everyone is on the same page!!!\r\nI've never taken stats before, and the class was the perfect introduction. It might be too slow/ boring for someone with exposure \r\ntake this over the fall stats sequence! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would strongly recommend this class to students looking for an interesting, challenging, but reasonable QR credit or those interested in gaining a clear and comprehensive introduction to statistics concepts. Class was well-structured, well-taught, and provided ample opportunity for getting help about particularly difficult concepts. Though the class is not explicitly applied (as opposed to the fall iteration), the textbook and class repeatedly reference practical applications of course like property taxes and sports judging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any non-STEM person looking for a manageable QR credit. Having taken a very overwhelming QR course in the past, I really appreciated the pace at which this class moved and the fact that it is truly designed to accommodate non-STEM students. Very manageable class if you put in even the minimal effort required. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course.  A knowledge of statistics is valuable no matter what career path one decides to pursue. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for someone looking for an inroad into statistics and data science. Definitely pushes one to consider statistics and its real-world relevance, beyond just rote memorisation of formulae. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to take a challenging but totally doable class that will change the way you think about pretty much everything, take intro stats w/ Jay Emerson "
