            "\u00a0My writing improved immensely on the technical side, and I was also able to absorb the strengths of my peers. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my fiction writing and my ability to edit others work. ",
            "\u00a0I leave this course with a better sense of my own writing's strengths and weaknesses, having learned how to dramatically revise a piece based on feedback. I also learned to think and comment critically on the writing of others - something I've never had to do before! ",
            "\u00a0Honed my storytelling abilities more than my literary style. Learned to produce consistently through the daily journal. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome!!! I learned a bunch of things and developed a bunch of skills, but perhaps the most important was that I learned how to not be afraid of criticism of my work. The atmosphere of the classroom was so supportive that it allowed me to step out of my shell. ",
            "\u00a0I loved being in this workshop. I certainly grew as a fiction writer through discussions in class, the critiques I received from peers, and writing critiques for my peers. I understood my own writing more through the workshop and revision processes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The workshop format of the class allows you to interact from your peers and get an insight into their writing minds. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Choi is a fantastic workshop facilitator; it's a great chance to improve your writing; excellent peer stories\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Love the workshop style! It was so useful to get feedback from both the professor and the students! ",
            "\u00a0We should have read more published stories. It would have provided a nice reference point for our own work and exposed us to new styles and techniques that would have pushed our writing forward over the course of the semester. I would have preferred not to have a revision workshop, which I thought was relatively unhelpful, and instead devoted time to discussing professional work. Also, I think everyone writing a workshop letter for every piece led to redundancy and superficial feedback. In the future, the number of workshop letters should be reduced to promote quality over quantity. Finally, Professor Choi should hold private conversations with students after each workshop to really dissect the criticism of other students, which was often overwhelming and contradictory. ",
            "\u00a0All strengths, no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0This course was very beneficial to me in the way it was structured. I liked having to keep a daily notebook and turning in two ofinak stories with one revision. I felt that I produced a lot of good content in this class that I would like to develop further. ",
            "\u00a0First off, I found the daily notebook set-up to be super useful! Professor Choi's feedback was also uniformly great and I consistently enjoyed class discussions. There were a few times when I found discussions got a bit cluttered. Prof. Choi could have limited her comments somewhat to ensure that students had plenty of space to speak - but that being said, her comments were always extremely spot on, but could have been more judiciously used to hit points that students left out or raise questions when the discussion lags. "

            "\u00a0Yes. You'll meet many amazing writers and have so much fun during the workshops! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take Fiction Writing with Prof. Choi if you can. It's a phenomenal workshop experience and we all improved together. Greatly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0If you like writing and want to get better at it, take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Choi is an incredibly knowledgeable and kind professor, and though I am not sure how much my writing improved, I would definitely recommend taking the class with her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take this course!! Susan does an excellent job of fostering a positive class environment where you can share even deeply personal work, and the more participation-based (rather than assessment-based) structure of the class allows you to focus more on growing creatively rather than constantly worrying about your grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely  Professor Choi is so welcoming to each student regardless of writing background. The workshop is the perfect environment to experiment with your writing and to improve your own voice. "
