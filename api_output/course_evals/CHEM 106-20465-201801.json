            "\u00a0Essentially just a condensed version of Intro Chem. We learned quite literally about 3 forensics-related facts all semester. ",
            "\u00a0None ",
            "\u00a0I went into the course with an extremely limited knowledge of Chemistry, and came out with a much better sense of the operations of Chemistry and the scientific process. As a non-science major, I found the course very fair and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0An very thorough, introductory course to basic Chemistry and some Forensics applications. "

        [
            "\u00a0I understand that it's a chemistry course and is focused on chemistry, not on teaching forensics, but you can't have a course called \"Chemistry and Forensics\" and learn as little about forensics as we did in this course. I had assumed the idea would be to learn the chemistry OF forensicsso that the course would be about chemistry and forensics simultaneously. But the inclusion of \"forensics\" in the title is just a cheap way of getting people to sign up to take the course. It's just a condensed version of Intro Chem, and you learn nothingreally nothingabout either forensics or the chemistry of forensics. ",
            "\u00a0Prifessors demonstrations were definitely the plus point in not only making the course interactive but also relating what we learnt to real life situations ",
            "\u00a0It was a very informative class and the teacher was thorough yet I found I needed a few more classes to cover the amount of material that we covered. I felt that is was hard taking this course coming from no knowledge of the subject. You should be familiar with some basic chemistry first. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0No. Take Intro Chem if you want to learn basic chemistry. This course will teach you nothingquite literally nothingabout forensics, and it teaches you all sorts of intro chem things that aren't presented in the context of forensics at all. So if you're gonna learn intro chem material, then you might as well get official recognition of that on your transcript. ",
            "\u00a0The class meets at 9AM on the furthest part of campus from everything and you aren't going to be taking this because you love chemistry, I can assure you of that.  He makes it sound like the class is going to be very intense on the first day (like 25 people showed up and 6 or 7 actually remained in the class after the first session), but the class isn't difficult.  If you can do algebra, you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely for those who are pursuing career other than chemistry but still want to learn about the natural world. "
