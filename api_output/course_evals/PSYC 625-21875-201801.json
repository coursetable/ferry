            "\u00a0This course really informed how I think about the ties between cognition and perception. I've also become more comfortable discussing my thoughts in a larger group setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned 1) what social perception is, 2) criticisms of the field, 3) progress that's been made in the field, 4) common methods used to study visual perception, visual attention, facial processing, and other phenomena that fall under the umbrellas of \"perception\" and more specifically \"social perception.\" ",
            "\u00a0Gives you a good background of the different topics and issues in social perception, which itself is such an interesting intersection of two different areas of psychology! ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about perception, and the course inspired some ideas for future research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to critically evaluate research in both vision science and social psychology. I learned a lot about how to integrate two interesting and often distinct fields of work to learn more about both "

            "\u00a0I liked that we read both \"good\" papers and \"bad\" papers which forced us to think critically about what makes a good paper and good data. I liked the discussion session format. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this is a very strong course. At times, we ran low on time, and I wished we could have delved deeper into some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course's major strength is its instructor. Brian Scholl is truly excellent. He is an extremely thorough and thoughtful communicator, and he's clearly an expert in this field. For every discussion, he prepared a considerable amount of content to incorporate. Also, for each discussion, he carefully read our required responses and tied them into the flow of conversation.  \r\n\r\nI have only 2 criticisms, both relatively small: 1) There should be fewer readings, so that we can actually discuss what we read in detail, and 2) There should be a lecture component to the class, along with a discussion period, so that we can hear about all the points Brian wants to make (which are all awesome) AND discuss the readings in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely an amazing course. It was very structured and purposeful. Learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0the readings and discussions are great\r\nmaybe more feedback would be better ",
            "\u00a0Great selection of readings, though \"social perception\" was a bit of a misnomer: we had one class on olfaction, but everything else was about visual processing, rather than all modalities. There was plenty in visual perception to go through, though, so that's not much of a negative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of thought went into the papers we talked about, brian did a great job of leading class discussions, and i loved the idea of bringing in additional readings each week, i think it added a lot to class discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we could occasionally get side tracked, but it wasnt too much of a problem.
