            "\u00a0This is a really cool class that does a little bit of modern Chinese history (fall of imperial China to China now), domestic and international issues China may face today. There is absolutely no expectation that you know Chinese or have taken a class on China before and Professor Mattingly does a great job of making this class accessible. He also kind of teaches you how to evaluate political science research design, although I would say you could get a little lost if you've never taken a basic stats class-- something to keep in mind. This was the first year that this class was offered though, so he might change it a little or a lot depending on these evaluations. I liked it! ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course knowing absolutely nothing about modern China. Having taken this course, I feel like I have a very solid understanding of how Chinese politics and society has developed into what it is today and how crucial a role China will play in the future of international politics. Most importantly, having taken this course, I feel confident that I can pick up any high-level news article or academic paper about modern Chinese politics and understand it really well. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the historical, domestic and international trajectory of China over the last 300 years. Very informative and thought provoking ",
            "\u00a0I learned that I don't know or understand political science. I always walked into assignments with the confidence that I understood the material and then walked away being more confused than ever. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who went into the course with a knowledge of China I still felt I learned so much. Taking this class made me realized how much I care about Chinese politics and U.S.-China relations and that I definitely want the work I do in the future to involve these things. ",
            "\u00a0The first third of the course was devoted to China's modern history from about the 1800s through the Chinese Revolution up to the present.\r\nThe second third was all about the domestic politics of China (the party-state, elite politics, urban/rural China, dissent, and ideology).\r\nThe last third was about China in the international sphere (Thucydides trap, military, the environment, nationalism, and territorial disputes).\r\nThroughout, also focused on analyzing and critiquing scholarly articles. ",
            "\u00a0Due to this class I have a much more comprehensive understanding of China's role in the world order, the analytical frameworks used to discuss China and Chinese politics and pressures. I am also more familiar with critiquing political science research papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about China specifically, but also feel that I improved my writing skills with the reading responses and also improved my ability to read academic articles, research articles and historical documents; realizing that each should be approached differently. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the Chinese Communist Party, the structure of the Chinese party and state, and the government's current major domestic and international political challenges. I also learned about basic of practices of political science thinking, which was especially helpful since this was my first PolySci course. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing course\r\n\r\nI learned so much about Chinese politics/history which has inspired me to take even more courses about East Asia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about China's history/economics/geography, research design, and some key frameworks in political science. Students should definitely take this course to supplement their knowledge on China. I had some background going in and was really surprised at how it was accessible and informative for all levels of experience with China. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great general overview of contemporary China. I feel well prepared engaging in more in depth discussions of China. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed mainly a deeper understanding of China and how it interacts with the world. I also feel that I have learned more about the rise of governments and authoritarian politics. Lastly, I have learned how to engage with a range of materials ranging from research studies to larger books and how to process the information they hold in an efficient way. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic way to learn more about Chinese history and contemporary Chinese politics. As someone who knew next to nothing about China before taking this course, I appreciated how Professor Mattingly eased us into the complexities of China and how he made the material accessible to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Chinese history and politics. The functioning of the PRC as a model of government. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a ton about Chinese politics and how to read research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Ive gained a multifaceted understanding of Chinese politics and history and have learned a variety of useful frameworks used in political science to analyze trends and systems which exist within autocratic governments. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to more effective analyze course readings in preparation for discussions ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great introduction to contemporary Chinese history and politics. We also discussed current events and learned many theories that could be applied to the study of modern China. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of Chinas current economic, political and social situation. Really helpful in understanding possible threats to power, and chinas Own ride as a potential threat to the US ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a great overview of China's history and how it shapes modern day economic policy, domestic challenges, and international agendas. ",
            "\u00a0The class began with an overview of Chinese history with a particular focus on the last ~100 years and how China rose from a poor, closed off, rural, agrarian society to a rich, industrialized, urban powerhouse. Then we focused on the current Chinese political structure and challenges. You learn how to think about the material in terms of broader theoretical frameworks and challenge assumptions about China. Professor also makes a point to teach students how to read academic papers, think critically about the research design, and the contributions the paper made. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Good historical overview, very organized slides, reading load is very reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can be a bit challenging for those not familiar with political science research design and basic political science frameworks but Prof Mattingly does try to teach it to us as we stumble upon these questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent lectures, well-rounded and interesting syllabus, interesting discussion sections, relatively light workload, and a great guest lecture. I can't really think of any weaknesses to the course. ",
            "\u00a0It's certainly a well structured class and does well to constantly feel as though there is progress. On the other hand, there's simply too little time to really get into any depth which severely limits the overall value of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is that Prof. Mattingly is a great lecturer. The weakness is that the expectations were really high without any real guidance to how to achieve those expectations (especially as a non-PS major) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the workload was very fair. I really liked having to write two response papers and present these in the discussion section. I was able to pick two topics that really interested me and diving deeper into both was enjoyable and informative. The take-home final was great and allowed me to reflect on the themes of the course and use the skills I had learned to evaluate a research paper in political science. For this being the first time the class was taught, I thought it went so smoothly. The course was incredibly well organized. The topics of each lecture were relevant, timely, and interesting. The documentaries excerpts that were shown were fascinating and I actually went back and watched the rest on my own time. One weakness of the course is that I felt the in-class discussions were stilted and limited. There was never really enough time for meaningful discussion. I do think to have some discussion in class would be nice, but maybe more time should be allotted for it if it is to occur at all. Also, I usually use my laptop to take notes in class. In many of my other classes, lecture notes and slides are sketchy and incomplete and I rely on thorough notes from class to study for my exams. However, I realized in this class that was not necessary. Instead, Professor Mattingly's recommendation to handwrite the notes would probably have been better. He made his slides available online and provided study guides for the midterm (super helpful) and it made it so that now, looking back, I did not need to take notes using my laptop. I wish I hadn't but I still enjoyed this course so much and felt I retained the information well regardless. ",
            "\u00a0it's a gut, and people treated it as such, which can be frustrating if you are trying to learn a lot especially in section. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, can't think of any suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this was a great course that was informative, interesting and relevant. The only suggestion I would have for the course would be to include a quiz on the Chinese political and government structure, as I often got the two mixed and confused. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mattingly's lectures were very well-organized and efficient - I felt it was easy to understand the course's main points, class time was consistently well-used, and the course had a well-constructed narrative that was easy to follow. There was some good variety in the course material - documentaries (in particular, The Chinese Mayor) and close analyses of studies and papers.\r\nSome of the lectures in the second half of the course got fairly rote, and I at times I would have liked more background information beyond what was on the PowerPoint slides. It might have been helpful to go over, say, coverage of a particular issue by state-run media or an analysis of changes in the operation of a particular SOE, to illustrate some of the broader trends we discussed in class.\r\nI wish we'd spent some time on the CCP's treatment of religious and ethnic minorities - this felt like a gap in the course material.\r\nI enjoyed the variety of readings in the course - in particular, the reading on the ecology of the Tiananmen Square protest really stuck with me, and I also found the Jessica Chen Weiss book very interesting even if I didn't agree with all of its conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-organized, covered all the major information we needed to know and gave us the opportunity to go more in-depth if we wanted.\r\n\r\nI can't quite think of any weaknesses--it was fair for all students, I believe, and I say this as a first-year with minimal political science/quantitative analysis experience. ",
            "\u00a0Great in-class activities, well-constructed syllabus with clear expectations, efforts by Professor Mattingly to assist and meet with students about opportunities related to China, sincere interest from Professor Mattingly in the subject matter. The movies selected were all great, but sometimes a little difficult to stay awake during post-lunch (sorry!) ",
            "\u00a0This class is well organized and the readings are well-thought out. These readings complement the lecture well and lecture/section were extremely helpful and interesting to attend. There are a lot of readings some weeks, so we didnt get to discuss all of them in section (which definitely enhances your understanding). I think it would be helpful to know the key takeaways for each week, so that students can make better use of office hours if they feel that after lecture and section, they have not fully grasped the key takeaways. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class certainly does a good job of presenting a large knowledge of China. I think the class also does a good job of presenting both the negatives and the positives of China and the CCP. Lastly, the course is very intriguing and lectures were always engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that for a class posted as part of the International Relations part of the major it could include more content on the international politics and shorten the history and domestic politics portion. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is the best strength. The professor covers all the material in a non-biased way mostly and he is ver knowledgeable on China. The sections could be improved a bit but the TAs did the best and asked provoking questions ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing, really. This was my favorite course. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well-organized, but hard to synthesize multiple readings into one reading response ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the readings give a comprehensive insight into many current issues and the workload is very manageable. The only downside is that we didnt receive much feedback on our work since there are only two response papers aside from the midterm and final exam. ",
            "\u00a0I wasnt a huge fan of the readings that were chosen ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I was very satisfied with the course. The material was organized in a way that made sense. The course had a significant amount of reading but was broken up nicely. My section TA did an amazing job with covering the most important points of the readings in section. No complaints about the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course far outweigh any weaknesses. The material is fascinating and made me much more informed about China's rise, which is one of the most stunning events of the last century and will probably continue to be the most important geopolitical shift to pay attention to in the next century. One of the greatest strengths of this course, however, is that is is \"bigger\" than China. It teaches you how to think about comparative politics using theoretical frameworks and how to read and think critically about academic papers. Professor Mattingly is so down-to-earth and a great lecturer. Another strength is the structure of the readings and assignments. The readings are interesting and not overwhelming, which makes students more inclined to actually read them. There is also a list of optional readings in case you are particularly interested in a subject. The workload (assignments) is totally manageable and well-structured to help students learn. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class structure was very good and helpful. Start from the past and work your way to the present. Prof. Mattingly is great and knows tremendous amount of knowledge on the topic. Lecture was awesome. ",
            "\u00a0I personally did not do well on writing assignments and I didn't know why, so I think feedback was not great on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and the section often times felt very separate. The first portion of term, for example, featured lectures that were often based on Chinese history and sections that were based on political theory. This meant that, sometimes, what needed to be covered wasn't or that the two (the history and the theory) weren't quite integrated. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was so interesting and reasonable work load. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%! This course was one of the best I've taken at Yale. If you're at all curious about how China became the way is it today and what China's rise will mean for the future of international affairs (which you really should be), you should definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0As the political science department goes, this is one of the rare, decent classes. It's as intellectually challenging as hunting geese with a guided missile launcher, but at least Mattingly seems to actually care about the subject. Honestly, if you're a PoliSci major, you can do FAR WORSE than this class. But given how utterly horrendous the department is at this point, that may not be saying much. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introduction to Chinese political history. Professor Mattingly is very engaging and very knowledgeable. I could not recommend this class enough to someone who wants to learn about the development of China and the CCP. ",
            "\u00a0If they are not political science no. I think it was a good class because I learned about modern China but I felt out of my league with all the technical papers and such. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course to another student. It has been one of the most interesting, truly enjoyable, and non-stressful classes I've taken at Yale, a highlight of my experience here. The course benefited from having an engaging professor and wonderful TA (Anna Feurer), who were both flexible and committed to their students. I learned so much about China and it made me realize that whatever I do in the future, I want it to be related to Chinese politics. Loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have no experience with China but are interested, then yes. Prof Mattingly is fantastic and you will learn a lot.\r\nIf you have experience with China, but still need an intro history class, then take China from Mao to Now taught by Denise Ho.\r\nIf you already feel comfortable with China, take something else! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is such a great class with interesting (and super relevant) material. Professor Mattingly is very knowledgeable and imparts his knowledge clearly in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend everyone to take this course! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of Chinese politics - the history of communism in China, the structure and operation of the Chinese Communist Part, and major domestic and international policy challenges. The lectures are concise, informative, and thorough, and Professor Mattingly is low-key and approachable. For me, it was a great overview on China and a helpful introduction to political science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you're interested in China at all. ",
            "\u00a0A must take for anyone seeking to understand geopolitics, East Asia, or learn about an interesting contrast to American institutions and behaviors. I have already used what I learned in the course in a number of other contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course if youd like an introduction to contemporary China! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would very much so. I enjoyed the class and the content. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone at all interested in China. Even for a student not especially interested in the country, it is always helpful to study the inner workings of another country in order to gain a better comparative perspective on politics here in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in China or world politics, I think you could benefit from taking this class. That said, you can probably get all of the information on the syllabus from Wikipedia. Prof. Mattingly is nice but not particularly stimulating, and his lectures were summaries more than anything else. In general, I think Yale professors should teach not just the basic overview of a subject but also offer some special insight you can't get with ten minutes of internet browsing. I think this is a result of the structure of the course, not of Prof. Mattingly's ability as a scholar or professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Take it and you'll learn so much about Chinese society and politics so that you can make your own conclusions about US-China relations. And attend Professor Mattingly's lectures-you won't regret it ",
            "\u00a0I would, the workload isn't bad and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It gives you a baseline knowledge of Chinese politics. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who is interested in Chinese politics. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of Chinese history and politics, definitely recommend if you are interested in China ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course if you are even slightly interested in understanding China and its history! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely- great chance to learn about the largest economy in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of whether you are a GLBL or PLSC major. There are many misconceptions about China in the news. This course breaks down many of these misconceptions. The course is well-organized and the work is straightforward and easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Even if you are not a political science major or interested in politics, it is really important to learn about China's rise for many reasons. First and foremost, the next century will likely be China's Century, so you should know how they rose and what that means for us. There are many misconceptions of China (particularly their authoritarian government) propagated in the media, so this class helped me gain a fuller and more accurate understanding of China. This class will also help you in your other classes because it teaches you how to think critically about academic papers and read effectively without wasting time. Professor Mattingly is awesome and makes the class accessible and interesting for people with no background on China, so don't worry about that. Workload is manageable so there is no reason not to take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes highly recommend. Great class to have credit d just to earn more about China and how their political system works. Especially since China is rising fast today it was very useful and applicable. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so cool because you learn about political science within the framework of an authoritarian government.  It is a bit of a survey class, but all the readings are interesting and worthwhile.  The essays are fairly short and easy to write, because they just help you think through and analyze the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a very interesting topic. If you are a political science major I think yes. As a history major, I didn't like the political science approach but that is more personal. The material is very informative and interesting. "
