I would have liked to learn about things that I could do; it felt like I was learning about things that are not particularly applicable to me at this point in my life. ",
            "\u00a0This course was okay. For some reason, the lectures seemed a little endless and dry, surprisingly. I think they just went on without any audience participation for a little too long. ",
            "\u00a0It is not in the right sequence at all. We need to ease into global health. There is the air of 'white saviourism' with which topics were chosen. Global health is MORE than that. There needs to be more basics at the beginning and a build-on. I would also like for there to be more structure given to each of the seminar speakers. Some of them are good, but some have no structure. It would help if there were consistent structure given to each of them. ",
            "\u00a0It's nice to hear about other people's work however, the class seemed a little long. It would also be nice if the class was in the afternoon and not the evening and lunch was provided. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures, however there could be more focus on a diversity of countries (i.e. those in Asia) or other non-communicable disease (i.e. mental d/o). ",
            "\u00a0The course was helpful in showing us different ways that people study global health. ",
            "\u00a0It was a nice way of getting to know the breadth of people's research interests in the field of global health. It was very conversational in its structure (in that students were able to discuss themes of global health with practitioners following the lecture). ",
            "\u00a0Some of the speakers were really interesting. However, majority of them weren't engaging. The topics were definitely interesting, but the talks didn't match up ",
            "\u00a0Pretty interesting seminar speakers. Maybe send a poll at the beginning of the semester to help gauge what students are interested in, and bring people accordingly.\r\nThe other seminars have food, would be nice to have snacks or something for this evening seminar as well! ",
            "\u00a0The course really varied depending on the guest lecturer. For some, I wish it was less about their research and findings, and more about how they cultivate relationships and help create sustainable programs in a global context. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly organized. I feel this seminar would be a lot better at the end of my global health education. I know it's meant to be an introduction but half the time we don't know anything about the issues discussed. Also scheduling this for 5pm on a Thursday was a massive mistake. I have already been through 9 hours of class by this point and just wanted to leave. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Wide diversity of topics covered\r\nWeaknesses: Focuses a lot on communicable/infectious diseases, a lot of our speakers were also white and/or American, which wasn't extremely helpful for a global health context. Would have liked to see more of an international perspective and to see what international research do in the U.S. and how they apply the findings to other countries. ",
            "\u00a0please include global health work done in other countries, not just african countries, and should be representative of global work that is better than the US health system- not just countries that are below the US in levels of comparison ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - invited speakers from different realms in the public health field. It was truly inspiring to hear from some of the speakers and the work that they do. It also gave us a chance to speak the ups and downs that there are in any research project and how they worked through it. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was a reasonable introduction to various topics in global health.  I don't think it was a great introduction to global health overall, especially for students who have never studied or worked in that field before. We weren't asked to think about our own identities, biases, or reasons for wanted to work in this field. There was only 1 introductory seminar given about the field as a whole. I think the global health certificate should start with a comprehensive introductory course, and have this seminar on top of that. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this seminar. It provided us with a wide variety of topics and interests in public health. I loved getting to hear from so many people about different aspects of the global health field that better opened my eyes to what I could be doing in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the seminar style of the class which allowed for discussions between students and faculty. ",

            "\u00a0. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting lectures and seminars but wish there had been more of an opportunity for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Selected talks covered interesting topics, but given the late timing of the course and the frequent lack of student engagement, this elective became somewhat burdensome. I would recommend both distilling the elective into a 60-min talk and working to incorporate more interaction with students. ",
            "\u00a0interesting sometimes ",
            "\u00a0I found most of the guest speakers and their subject matter interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the speakers that came in were interesting and so were some of the readings they chose to have us read. But otherwise, the seminars felt like they had no progression; they were just randomly chosen speakers. Sometimes repeating subjects and locations. There was little accountability on our end which I did not appreciate because several students would not even attend seminar. Instead, they would wait nearby and just scan the code afterward. While the rest of us actually made a commitment. And if all the seminars were going to be just speakers then they easily could have just been for an hour earlier in the day. The time was incredibly inconvenient every week. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class has a lot of potential but failed to foster interesting and advanced discussions. There are three main places I think it could improve:\r\n1. All of the speakers seemed like they were prompted to present to a very \"general knowledge\" type of audience. Everyone in that class is either in public health or medical training of some sort. Why did we have to sit through things like \"this is what TB is\" and \"what viral loads are\" every single week. It was frustrating because I think the speakers were not able to or not prompted to raise the truly critical discussions in global health \r\n2. While the topic each week was different, there was not diversity in experience or background from the presenters. Mostly well off white people doing research or working at headquarters environment. The policy workshops did a much better job of preparing us for career afterwards. When you get people who have worked \"on the ground\" or are actually from a low or middle income country, the discussions will naturally be more interesting. \r\n3. I think this course might be more productive/ interesting if we can't get better speakers if there were more critical issues raised or the question section felt a little more lively/ debate style. For example, during the Uganda midwifery presentation, I texted my friend who is a Ugandan midwife the project being presented, and he thought it seemed terrible and silly-midwives might be illiterate, but they aren't children! Singing and dancing seems distracting. But this class never felt like the right environment to have these discussions so I didn't feel comfortable raising. \r\n4. The last class seemed WILDLY inappropriate. It is uncomfortable to watchin a group setting 10 minutes of women describing their violent rapes, and moreso unnecessary. More than that, this is literally the only exposure I can think of in this course where students were learning about non-academia/Us-based applications of global health. How terrible for the students that actually want to work in global health! ",
            "\u00a0The speakers chosen equated global health work as Africa. I think its also important to consider what speakers are complicit in the white savior complex/are problematic. Some speakers were also not engaging.  The global health fair was well put together! ",
            "\u00a0I was frustrated with the course schedule because it overlapped with many of the professional skills seminars. I also think there could be a better way to handle checking in for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Good seminar in global health issues. Wish the seminar was at a better time. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar is late on a very busy day for me so I was drained and though the information was interesting, there were times I struggled to engage. I believe if there was a need to have it that late in the evening dinner should always be provided. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent overview of topics in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Coming from outside the school of public health/medical school, I really liked this course. It was interesting and I picked up a lot of new ways to look at things. It's hard to give it a general grade since there was a new lecturer every week, so it was different every time. Some topics were more interesting than others, and some speakers more engaging than others. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the wide variety of guest speakers and lecture topics. However, some lectures were quite dry and felt as though speakers were just trying to pass time for the last 20 minutes of class. ",
