            "\u00a0the neuroscience behind decisions we make in our everyday lives ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about reward processing and the neural components that go into decision-making. ",
            "\u00a0I  became more skilled and comfortable with reading a wide range of psychology and neuroscience papers (empirical and non-empirical), and also got practice in synthesizing, comparing, and contrasting the methods and findings of several papers across common themes (which was the way that the course was set up.) I was additionally able to further develop the ideas from the papers in class discussions; the discussions themselves assumed that you understood the readings, and this sometimes meant that a relatively strong psychology and/or neuroscience background was necessary in order to follow and contribute meaningfully to the discussions, but I enjoyed this because we were able to get into the \"nitty-gritty\" of the readings relatively quickly. This allowed me to learn a great deal in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I really got a firm understanding of decision neuroscience and an appreciation of its broader implications. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth understanding of value-based decision making in the brain, social decision making regarding preferences such as altruism, fairness, and punishment, and various potential real-world applications of neuroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting connections between neuroscience findings and things like neuromarketing, altruism, and punishment ",
            "\u00a0Neuroscience and critical thinking ",
            "\u00a0This course opens your eyes to so much about how people make decisions, and is a super accessible/interesting neuroscience course. The syllabus allows students to understand the neural mechanisms behind so many important phenomena, and students become more informed students as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the computational mechanisms underlying our basic decision making abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I gained extensive knowledge of social decision making and the ways in which decision making is tested and examined in lab settings. I also understand better how to talk about the topic and ask deeper and more critical questions about the material I am reading. "

            "\u00a0strengths: interesting readings, logical progression of readings, good professor \r\nweaknesses: sometimes discussion was a bit hard to keep up ",
            "\u00a0Weekly reading response was sometimes hard to get in by the 4pm Sunday deadline, but I think it was good in that it made sure everyone had done the readings. But it is a 2 hour seminar and sometimes it really just dragged on... not really Prof. Crockett's fault I guess, it's hard to talk about research papers for that long. It definitely got more interesting towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed well -- each week focuses on a different topic, and the topics progress in a meaningful way, with each subsequent week's readings building on those of the previous weeks. I found every week's topics, readings, and discussions really interesting, though some weeks were certainly more \"hot topic-related\" (e.g., the weeks where we covered psychopathologies and neuromarking/neurofinance) than others (e.g., the first few weeks, where we discussed reward prediction errors). There were some moments in these initial weeks where discussion seemed to lull at times -- though I'm not sure if this is attributable to the topics we covered or my classmates and I still adjusting to the class and to each other. Professor Crockett allows the conversation to take whichever directions it naturally ends up in, and always has meaningful and extremely well-informed contributions to each of the comments that my classmates and I made. I appreciated the free-form nature of class discussions, but others may have found it a little too loosely-structured.\r\n\r\nAssignments-wise, I appreciated the weekly reading responses that we submitted before class. Because they require you to summarize and synthesize all of the readings, you're forced to closely read everything -- which made for better and more informed discussions in class. The final paper is also very manageable -- you meet with Professor Crockett beforehand and submit a proposal, so by the time you sit down to write it, you're comfortable and clear about how to proceed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings were well selected and organized. Weaknesses: I felt that the discussions could have been a bit more lively and organized. ",
            "\u00a0Lively and enjoyable discussions in a seminar setting coupled with both classic and very current readings in the field. Overall a wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion could be a little more structured. Maybe have a list of topics to discuss or questions to pose at the beginning to help start the conversation, since sometimes it felt like we weren't sure what to talk about. The jumpstarts at the beginning of class were a good aspect of class time. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: you will learn a lot!\r\nWeakness: led by students too much. Needs more professor guidance. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is excellent! Dr. Crockett is amazing, the workload is appropriate, and it's super interesting. The one thing I would perhaps change is making the draft for the final paper a more substantive grade/assignment as it didn't allow for enough feedback to set up your final paper for success -- and there weren't any other assignments that were really similar to the final paper in terms of knowing what type of writing/research Professor Crockett is looking for. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussions were incredibly interesting, although I sometimes wished Dr. Crockett would lecture more so that we could fully understand all details of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Reading materials are very thorough and incredibly interesting but I do feel that the professor could speak a little earlier about what she is looking for regarding the reading responses. I definitely got the hang of it eventually but I do feel that I could have earlier if we had had a more in depth conversation at the start of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes, interesting topics and nice professor! Not too much background needed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But it is definitely helpful if you've already taken a neuroscience or psych class before and are comfortable with reading scientific papers. Some were pretty dense and took me a while to get through. It's a manageable workload, the only work is really the weekly readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, if you're a cognitive science, psychology, or neuroscience major! The course definitely assumes a pretty high level of neuroscience and psychology background, but if you are qualified and are admitted to the course, you will learn a lot. I was genuinely excited to go to this class every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - definitely take this course if you are interested in understanding the principles by which the brain makes decisions, and want to engage in great discussions about various applications of current neuroscience and neuroeconomics research. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to someone who has an extensive interest in the topic. I felt like I had already covered some of the material in other classes, so some of the time this was like a review of things I had seen before. However, the neuroscience topics are applied to real-world topics (especially towards the end of the semester) so it was different enough that I wasn't bored. In terms of weekly workload, it's not the worst. You have to read 5-6 scientific papers and write a response every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was interesting and very manageable ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You learn so much -- and Professor Crockett is so amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who likes to think about the mind and decision making. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I also would say that you should be willing to engage with the reading materials and speak in class. Not only does participation affect your grade but it makes the class time much more enjoyable when everyone is willing to dive in on the material and have an open dialogue. "
