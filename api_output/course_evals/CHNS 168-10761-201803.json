            "\u00a0I learned a diverse set of vocabulary with the common theme of business, economics, and entrepreneurship. We read articles and a textbook on businesses entering China and economic trends, which also gives a good overview of relevant topics in this field. \r\nYou will not be learning business actual skillsets in this class. Professor Chen is amazing, but she is not an economics professor, and the course still focuses on the language aspect a lot more than the material. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a lot of Chinese business terms, as well as developed some better essay writing and presentation skills. I was initially worried to take this class because my reading abilities aren't super strong, but I do feel as if they have now definitely improved. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of new vocab relating to the economy, politics, and business; practiced writing essays and presentations regularly; read actual news articles. Definitely have a MUCH better understanding of the Chinese economy and business environment. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new insights on Chinas current economic and political climate, ranging from large scale policy to the climate surrounding entrepreneurship. I also learned key terms and formal grammatical structures useful in communicating about them. ",
            "\u00a0A basic understanding of some of China's current geopolitical situations (i.e. the current economic slowdown, Belt and Road), as well as vocabulary knowledge to read some relevant articles in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about American companies trying to enter China, specific tactics they used, and whether/why they were successful. I also learned a lot about current events in China and its relationships with the U.S., which is especially helpful and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Chinese needed to talk about news related to the economic development of China and also about the stories of foreign companies entering China. "

            "\u00a0The course emphasizes vocabulary and grammar more heavily than it first looks, with time to participate or have discussions in class much shorter than expected. If there had been more time in class to present our views and actively discuss the reading rather than listening and doing vocabulary drills, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.\r\nOtherwise, very solid course with a passionate professor that will teach you a lot of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0The schedule of the course was given to us right at the beginning of the semester, and was super organized. We also got grades and feedback back super quickly, which was awesome to help us know how to improve. There was a good mix of reading materials (from news articles and textbooks) and videos that gave us various perspectives on the material we were learning about. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't say there were really any weaknesses - thought this course was organized super well! ",
            "\u00a0The workload was pretty unbalanced between weeks: one week we'd have a pretty tough-to-read news article, and the next we'd have a really easy textbook reading. The essays and presentations were consistent headaches, but I suppose it was good practice. I think the looser prompts were the better ones: writing about a favorite entrepreneur was interesting and fun (and we also got to hear about other people's favorites), whereas more prescriptive prompts like Should the US join the Belt-and-Road Initiative? left less room for creativity.\r\n\r\nThe textbook, I think, is too simplistic; I think reading just the news articles would be fine, especially if it were spaced out better (some nights I was up til 2 writing answers to comprehension questions; other nights I had almost nothing to do for class, even the night before).\r\n\r\nBut I learned a ton of vocabulary, some structures, and got excellent listening practice. I can now confidently open up a Chinese news article and parse my way through it, while before I definitely wouldn't have been able to do so.\r\n\r\nLast, and most importantly, Chen Laoshi is amazing -- so nice, helpful, and understanding. She met with all of us around mid-term to ask for our thoughts on the course, which is something that I haven't had a professor do before. We all went out for dim sum after classes ended and had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0Although the course is definitely on the hard side, the teacher is very helpful and great at leading the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topics, very kind professor, interesting additional essays, sometimes good class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: the grading on essays and presentations seemed pretty inconsistent at times, even when presentation style would remain the same ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazingly planned, and Professor Min Chen does an amazing job of keeping everyone on task and making the course really enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is how hard the teacher works. She was willing to spend time outside of class every week to help supplement my learning. You will read some interesting material but I think the real vigor of the class is determined by your classmates and if they aren't very active then the class can get awkward, because for a high level L5 class the structure is very similar to a L1 class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you want to rigorously improve your vocabulary, especially in business, take this course. It helps with the fundamentals.\r\nIf you want to practice your oral skills above all else, the other L6 classes may be a better fit for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I still firmly believe that the Chinese department is one of the best departments at Yale. This course did take a little more time than I expected, but that was because I had to look up so many characters - most of my friends didn't spend as much time as me on the course, and agreed that the course required a very reasonable time commitment. If you want to improve your Chinese skills, especially in a business setting, definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in business. If you are, you will learn incredibly useful and interesting vocabulary and information; if you aren't, you might be bored by the details. Either way, your reading and listening ability will increase a ton. The workload is manageable, but I wouldn't recommend it as a fifth class. We had essays and presentations every two weeks; a new news article (WSJ Chinese or other similar publications) every two weeks, with a lot of accompanying vocab practice; and textbook readings, which were very straightforward (not outrageously interesting, but okay).\r\n\r\nI think you'll get out of this class what you put into it. If you really try to improve your essay-writing and presentation-giving, this class will help you incredibly. If you just do the work, you will survive, and you will improve, but perhaps only in the realm of vocabulary acquisition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they are already very proficient in reading and writing Chinese and have a lot of time on their hands otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Generally, yes - I especially liked the topical focuses of the class. Professor Chen is also really wonderful, if a bit inconsistent in grading. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! "
