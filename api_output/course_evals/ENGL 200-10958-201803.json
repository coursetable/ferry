            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different comedies/romances and Shakespeare. Focus was more on plot and take-home themes and messages in lecture. Section was more focused on close reading (which was the important thing for the essays) ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough understanding of Shakespeare comedies and romances. My writing and analytical skills were challenged and developed. ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot more to Shakespeare's \"lighter\" plays than phallic jokes and marriage. In looking at how a festival renews people and rebirths them back into reality, we dissected these plays as a way to look at the transformative nature of humans. And honestly, they were just really fun plays. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth knowledge of the plot lines, characters, and themes of shakespeare's comedy and romance plays. You get a peak into Shakespeare's mind! ",
            "\u00a0Very good course, of course for the Shakespeare, but also for Professor Manley. Most of his lectures were insightful and offered a new take. Sometimes his takes were a little not-to-my-liking but they helped me learn nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques in close reading Shakespeare plays and how to construct a paper to evaluate an aspect of a certain play. I also learned historical background to better understand some of the social implications of the comedies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write short literary analysis papers. Lectures usually focused on analysis and criticism of the plays we read. ",
            "\u00a0I got a decent knowledge of Shakespeare, though the course was a little too general to really do more than an overview (which, in fairness, is all that it promises) ",
            "\u00a0A greater appreciation of Shakespeare, and the art of close reading. ",
            "\u00a0Basic background on Shakespeare, excellent essay writing foundation ",
            "\u00a0Close reading, critical thinking, and writing skills are developed ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a decent overview of the majority of Shakespeare's comedies and romances (all save for Love's Labour's Lost, The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Two Noble Kinsmen, and Cymbeline). You are asked to go deeper into Shakespeare's language to produce essays with theses that are both arguable and fresh. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to the vast majority of the comedies and romances of William Shakespeare.  The course allowed me to develop an ability to speak and write competently about the material we read in class. We were exposed to a variety of theories about the motives and origins of the plays.  The course provided original and novel interpretations of the material covered. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-get exposed to amazing plays\r\n-knowledgable professor \r\n-dedicated TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-would have liked more of an introduction to Shakespeare (who he is, what we know about him, etc.) on the first day ",
            "\u00a0This was a great English course. Professor Manley's lectures were engaging, and I genuinely enjoyed going to class. The essays required a lot of thinking and analysis, but the workload was very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very insightful and provided ideas to consider for essays. Section was also conducted very well and made it easier to attack concepts that we were still curious about after lecture. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: lecture was engaging and section always enhanced it in a meaningful way\r\nweakness: not enough emphasis on the performance of these plays (more emphasis on close reading the text) ",
            "\u00a0Because the course was a lecture, there wasn't much student-led discussion except for the 50 minute section once a week (which is honestly too short to have much discussion). However, lectures were usually answered most of the questions I had, so this felt okay. It felt like there was a slight lack of communication regarding what makes a successful paper, but office hours with the TA were helpful since the TA's do the grading. The mandatory revision was EXTREMELY helpful, but it would have been nice if placed on the first paper rather than the second so that we could get an idea of what the TA's were looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed section, and lectures were usually helpful and insightful. I do feel like a play per week was a bit too much, especially for a class where you only write papers on three of the plays. My TA was fantastic-- she was available outside of class to discuss papers and provided great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could def be more interesting, and there was very little guidance when it came to writing papers, etc. Basically feedback was not great, and there is NO way that the final is the best possible way to test if you're actually engaged with the material ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were sometimes hard to follow, but for the most part, they were amazing and provided really interesting interpretations and insight into the plays. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a wonderful survey of many of Shakespeare's plays. I wish there had been a more cohesive through-line to connect the themes of each play to the next, but they also worked stand-alone. I would love to write an essay using literary criticism or historical research. ",
            "\u00a0I think prof manley is incredibly knowledgeable. And his passion is infectious. However, I might have tried to switch up the lecture styles. Sometimes, a power point lecture can get repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Well structured, good lectures, reading pace is doable ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the dedication of the teaching fellows and the subject material itself (although the pacingone play per weekcan become daunting after the first few weeks). Some areas that could use improvement are the lectures (usually insightful, but occasionally hard to follow or not compellingly presented) and the expectations of students for essays. If you simply answer one of the provided prompt questions, you will probably receive the feedback to \"go deeper\" or to \"draw bolder conclusions.\" The class could benefit from a discussion of where, precisely, the line between bold and cockamamy lies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Manley is a great strength for the course. He is a well spoken lecturer and does very good impressions when reading from the passages. Section is engaging and useful.  The lectures are fun and interesting.  They present ideas which are original and not merely a synopsis of the play. The potential paper topics were useful jumping off points for creating a well thought-out essay. The final exam was fun to take and low stress.\r\nWeaknesses - It is difficult to tell the requirements for the papers.  After the first paper, it was much clearer what was expected.  If the first paper had a draft and revision option, instead of the second, that would allow for greater clarity.  I was a little unclear exactly how much detail we would need to know for the final exam.  It would have been helpful to have a couple of example solutions to go with the example questions. "

            "\u00a0If you love Shakespeare, absolutely! Essays were not too bad (3 essays that are 5 pp double spaced, one draft of an essay) and a one-hour final (quote ID, study his powerpoints) was not too bad either if you studied ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. It was a fascinating lecture course and Professor Manley was great. ",
            "\u00a0If you're into Shakespeare, definitely go for it. It's a chill class, and everyone always had a creative idea about how to interpret the text. The three essays are completely manageable, and reading a play a week is actually less difficult than you might think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great way to read a lot of Shakespeare! Only take the course if you are going to read the plays though. Only way to get everything out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. But don't take it because you think it'l be a gut. It's not, and will challenge you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course if you are interested in the comedies and romances and want to read them. The reading can seem a bit tedious sometimes because most of the plays deal largely with similar topics and even share character names, but it is very interesting to be able to compare and contrast themes. It's definitely rewarding to know that you've read most of Shakespeare's comedies. The grading varies sometimes (it seemed like one paper was graded super harsh, another more leniently), but the final exam was fair and the work load wasn't too much. I think you get out of this course what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a non-English major, I was a bit afraid to take this course, but it's accessible to anyone who's interested in Shakespeare, does the reading, and puts work into the papers. For a writing credit, the workload is very manageable (three 5-page papers), although the writing is balanced by the amount of reading. There is a short quote-identification final at the end of the course, which I think stressed people out more than it should have, since the quotes were pretty obvious if you attended lectures and section every week. The TAs are very supportive throughout the writing process, so this is a good class to take if you want to improve your writing and close-reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0So this course was pretty reasonable as long as you kept up and read the plays (though the lectures could get a little boring ...) RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END and then the final is an ABSURD exercise in recall with little to no guidance, and the practice passages we were given were near impossible. The actual final itself wasn't so bad, but there was also literally zero indication of how it was going to be graded, so I really don't know how this class is going to go and it was a lot of end-loaded stress that I wasn't exactly expecting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had only read one play on the syllabus before taking the class, and now I'm really glad to have delved into such great works, especially the romances. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this course if you are interested in Shakespeare, want to improve your analytical skills, and/or need a relatively chill writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Manley is great and Shakespeare is always enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for the sole purpose of familiarizing yourself with a large portion of Shakespeare's oeuvre. There are a lot of great plays in this course, including several of which I had no prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great way to learn about Shakespeare in a traditional lecture setting.  The papers are straightforward and the material is often easy to connect with.  You'll read 12 or 13 plays over the course of the semester, one a week. It helps a lot to keep up with the reading, but you can cram at the end if you need to.  The lectures are a must. Each begins with a great snippet of music Prof. Manley selected for the week's play and the lectures are informative and to the point.  It is very hard to learn any material from the slides alone, though seeing the images and text of the slides will likely jog your memory if you attended lecture in the first place. The sections are usually fun and student led discussions of that week's play. The small format makes it easier to learn people's names and to participate. "
