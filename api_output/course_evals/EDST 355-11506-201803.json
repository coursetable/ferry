            "\u00a0Listening skills - through triad exercises, how to listen and reflect people's feelings, to ask questions to help them explore why they might think or feel a certain way. Contemporary questions as they relate to the field of clinical psychology - medication controversy, criminalization of mental illness, aftermath of deinstitutionalization, alternative ways to disperse and administer psychotherapeutic intervientions, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of clinical psychology, different types of psychotherapy, prevention measures esp for the 21st century, and helping techniques which were put into practice in our clinical triad meetings. We also had the opportunity to visit a community/clinical therapy organization where we met with a therapist or director to ask questions about the challenges and strengths of the organization. An awesome opportunity to learn more about New Haven! ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my mind to mental health in America.  I also learned so much about therapy tactics and how to listen to people. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the US mental health system\r\nAwareness of mental illnesses\r\nGrowth of helping skills and techniques\r\nI enjoyed working with my classmates of color\r\nThis was the first class with majority students of color that I have taken at Yale and it improved my learning experience considerably ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about different helping skills and how to use them. We were able to visit a community health center and learn about how they function and take care of people with mental illness. ",
            "\u00a0Helping skills were learned exclusively through the triad. I got very little out of the lectures and thought question responses. ",
            "\u00a0Listening and helping skills; issues surrounding the treatment of people with mental illnesses in America ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different aspects of mental health ",
            "\u00a0This class has a focus on helping skills- this is the main sell, and the beauty of this course. We also learn a lot about the history, the sociopolitical, and the technical aspects of mental health care and general treatment/attitudes towards mental disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Diverse topics in clinical psychology. Focused on the history of treatment. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: really helps expose you to current issues within the field and get a sense of what therapy/practice is like. Thought questions do help you orient your thoughts and integrate lecture and reading material. Visit to a community mental health site gives you a lot of perspective on how practice we read about are addressed\r\nWeaknesses: because it was once a week for a 2 hour lecture, sometimes the end of lecture could drag a little but it was good that we got to watch videos of therapy/CBT/family therapy to diversify the mode of learning. Also it was a little confusing having two folders and having to do hard copies and final submission was hard copy and also electronic....loose paper and folders to keep track of though understandable why we need hard copies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very comprehensive lectures that help us understand contemporary debates and many angles to clinical psych issues; lots of anecdotes from Professor Lockhart to illustrate the variety of client experiences; weekly triad meetings are worthy time-commitment with interesting exercises that result in personal reflection and new friends, visit to a community provider, visit by Recovery Speaks\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you did the readings thoroughly (great readings), lectures are more of a useful synthesis rather than a challenge; not as much classroom debate/participation as I expected ",
            "\u00a0I loved all parts of this class!  The triad was a little unexpected so I didn't realized when I signed up for the class how much time it would take up. ",
            "\u00a0This course could benefit from research and readings from people of color. ",
            "\u00a0The triad experience was very cool. I enjoyed meeting every week with my group! The class is very low stress with only a weekly reading response and journal entry. The final paper was easy to write. I only wish we got more information about the final presentation/paper earlier. It felt very rushed at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The only strengths of the course are the triads and the visit to the community mental health facility. The lectures were dry and unorganized and the information in them never came up again in any sort of relevant context. Information was dated, grading was arbitrary. Prof. Lockhart was resistant to any sort of student feedback, which led to the class being incredibly blind in regards to intersectionality of mental health and race, SES, gender, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The triad exercises were my favorite and not only helped us apply what was learned in class, but also created meaningful relationships. The lecture slide presentation was least engaging. I loved the hearing voices experience, watching the Clara Hill video, and the roleplay exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- The triad design was nice as it allowed us to use some of the techniques that were mentioned in the book. It also allowed us to get to know other students in our class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The textbook we used was very outdated, this resulted in when trying to learn and application. While the videos were watched were entertaining, they were not very informative. These concerns be addressed by changing course material. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we never spoke about the readings therefore it resulted in a disconnected as we were not truly engaging in the material we wrote about in the response questions. Class was more like a lecture and not an active discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are not super exciting. I would suggest more discussion, and more open-mindedness from Professor Lockhart. Otherwise, the course is fun and generally somewhat well-designed. Emily, our TA, is great. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this course was the triad experience! I also enjoyed the community mental health center project. ",
            "\u00a0One of the few courses taking about clinical psychology at Yale. The visit to a mental health center, the diverse readings, and experiences proposed by the course are definitely a strength. "

            "\u00a0Yes, particularly if you are interested in pursuing clinical psychology or a healthcare-related field. Issues such as how medication should be incorporated into care, the interaction of severe mental illness and incarceration, and the problematic gap in care left behind by deinstitutionalization are issues you should think about entering these fields because of the context they provide. Treatment is largely reactive but it is important to think about possible preventative courses of action or lines of research - that is one important thing I learned through this class I didn't think enough. ",
            "\u00a0yes. the out-of-classroom opportunities are varied and rich supplements to lecture. however, do note that some topics are more emphasized than others. for example, cultural techniques in psychology focus more on global contexts rather than US race/gender contexts. on the other hand, focused a lot on stigma of mental illness which was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!  This class was really really cool and really helped me to figure out that I think I want to follow a career in public health. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a good overview of the mental health system in America. The weekly triad and the community program visits added great insight to the material we discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Please don't take this class unless there is some sort of major overhaul that entirely changes the content and professor. You learn nothing relevant and useful, and Prof. Lockhart really should not be teaching it anymore. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this class if it is still offered! It is relevant even if you don't want to pursue clinical psychology. You will learn how complex the issues surrounding the mentally ill are, as well as important listening and helping skills that are incredibly applicable. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. I feel as though the class did not really present it students with information that we did not already know. Even though the course is titled \"Clinical Psychology in the Community\", it lacked the community component. All we were required to do was to visit one clinic in New Haven and present about it. That alone does not give students a true reflection and understanding of the way in which clinical psychology is practiced, especially in New Haven. I would prefer a course that allows us to be more engaged with the material as well with the community. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning about community-level health care and mental health. I think the helping skills component- the triad meetings, the journal entries- are deeply meaningful across all student populations, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in clinical psychology, or exploring the topics covered by abnormal psychology in a more practical setting. "
