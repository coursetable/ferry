            "\u00a0I learned a lot about stories and story form. ",
            "\u00a0As a playwright especially interested in musical theater writing, this course was essential in establishing a firm basis in how shows are structured. The course is discussion-based with very little written work, which means you will get more out the more you put in. Marsha is incredible and it is no less than transformative to be able to bask in her wisdom every week. ",
            "\u00a0Marsha's unique take on story theory was really insightful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course doesn't really have a structure.  It is more an extended conversation with an extremely interesting woman. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course would probably benefit from an actual syllabus, but receiving information from Marsha on an anecdotal basis is also extremely helpful. She is the kind of person who will prioritize what she cares about, leading classes more like college teas as she answers questions and teaches us trade secrets. "

            "\u00a0Marsha Norman is a force.  I would take this course just to hear the nuggets of wisdom she has to share. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Although you may not write a libretto during the course, you will learn exactly how to write one, from story structure to the significance of certain objects (like shoes, for instance) throughout musicals of all eras. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they love musicals! You will not actually learn how to write a libretto, but Marsha Norman is a fountain of wisdom. Being in her presence every week is incredible. This class is a bit untraditional, as there was no syllabus or major assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Probably one of the most amazing classes at yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Yes. Yes. If you love musicals, definitely try and get yourself a space in this class. Many of the students in the class were those in the Drama School but you won't feel too out of place as an undergraduate. Marsha is down to earth and fills you in on all the industry secrets as well as WHY it is you like certain musicals and songs and how you can replicate such magic. Class was a very relaxing way to start Friday mornings and a great way to meet talented peers. She would love students with music backgrounds but you certainly don't need one to do well in or enjoy this class. You will get solid feedback on any story ideas you are working on and who knows you might even help Marsha Norman with something she's working on. "
