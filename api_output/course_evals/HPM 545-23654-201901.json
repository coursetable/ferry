Having taken the new Health Equity and Social Justice course, as well as this one, I think this one is such an important part of the curriculum and goes much more in-depth than HESJ does alone. \r\n\r\nI wish the format of the course consisted of less student presentations and more Shelley's teaching. She was such a valuable resource of experience that I feel we missed out on a bit. ",

The presentations were based on rough draft of our paper, however given that you basically needed to have a fully formed paper to present a meaningful, and sound piece of work this was somewhat hard because many of the professor and peer comments would require lots of time to research and fix (in time for the final paper due date, not presentations). I wonder if it would be helpful to have the presentations require students to present on their final paper (due earlier in the semester). ",

I understand this is Shelley's last year teaching the course, and I hope someone else picks it up, or more elements from this course are incorporated into the new Health Equity & Social Justice required course. I feel if Shelley and Trace were able to collaborate in the design, there could be the potential for a really excellent core course for students. ",
