            "\u00a0I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE AGGRAVATED IN MY LIFE. THIS IS A HARD, HARD CLASS AND I ONLY TOOK IT FOR THE GLOBAL AFFAIRS SECURITY REQUIREMENT BUT THEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEMESTER, GLOBAL IS JUST LIKE X GON GIVE IT TO YA, MERGES SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT, MAKES GAME THEORY AN ELECTIVE AND FORCES US TO TAKE INTERMEDIATE MICRO. WTF GLOBAL. ",
            "\u00a0The more advanced material at the end of the course is reviewed way too quickly. I would probably cut down on some of the readings and put more time into that material, such as discounting/repeated games and PBE. ",

            "\u00a0The course provided me with a useful analytical tool and a new understanding of various international happenings. Sometimes I was rather confused by the concepts covered in class that were much more complicated than the basic concepts we just recently learned, and although my TA and problem sets were very helpful, having more time spent on really making sure everyone understood the solution process would have been great. This would have made the exam questions much more approachable, as some of them, sadly, seemed to be well beyond my ability to solve. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teaching from Professor Debs and the TF Eli Rau. I felt that I had a good overarching knowledge of the history part and a solid understanding of most of the game theory. ",
            "\u00a0There needs to be more office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I found the material interesting but Prof. Debs was confusing at times when explaining quantitative material, and did not offer much engagement with the readings, mostly opening up discussion to students for part of the lecture and then going back to the slides to summarize very basic historical facts. This format for discussing readings was awkward and might be better done in sections, but sections were also packed as the TFs had to reexplain pretty much all of the quantitative stuff. TFs were great, but psets often threw in questions that we wouldn't learn how to do until the next week or that went way beyond what we were shown in lecture or section, which doesn't seem particularly fair. Readings were not always relevant, though mostly they were great. Half of the exams are short answer analyses based on readings, but the grading for these was not very clear. Response memo grading seemed overly harsh. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of the course is the great difference between what is covered in class and what is tested in problem sets and exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course, in theory, was a great idea for the Global Affairs major, as a number of IR papers include game theoretical models that are difficult to understand without the proper mathematical background. I also think, in theory, that connecting the math to international relations, was a good idea, in terms of making game theory more approachable and more interesting. However, I think that one huge weakness of the class is that there wasn't enough emphasis on the mathematical component of game theory. We really only learned how to approach it mathematically in section and in problem sets, which proved very challenging. Game theory is a very difficult mathematical concept to grapple with, and more time in lecture should have been spent on walking through the math of game theory, and solving more problems. Furthermore, problem sets and exams should not have students make the extra leap from what was learned in class. I, along with other students in the course, spent an exorbitant amount of time in office hours with the TFs, and even made extra appointments with the TFs to try and understand the material better.  Because we didn't cover a good foundation of these game theory aspects, tackling difficult math questions in the psets and especially on the exams is unfair to ask of us, as we don't have the skill sets to be ready to try challenging game theory problems, especially when it counts towards our grade. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of this course was the lack of practice. There was very little practice with the material which made it hard to learn and to know if you understood it. Also, the exams were not representative of the class. The exams were much harder than both the homework and the practice tests. ",
            "\u00a0Elon Rau was a fabulous TA. The feedback on our problem sets was very helpful and important to my learning. Lectures werent always easy to follow or learn from. ",
            "\u00a0At times the course was too fast paced in lecture; material was glossed over in order to fit the day's slides into the 50 minute time slot. In addition, based on what was asked on the exams, most of the mathematical information from lecture was extraneous and thus detracted from other, more important material. The structure and progression of the course was sound, although it would've been more beneficial to have been required to write a memo on all the major topics of the course, instead of just 2. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class spent too much time in the start of the year on easier things like calculating pure strategy Nash equilibria...honestly there is no need to spend more than one lecture on it. The problem arose when toward the end we were learning more complex models, but did not spend as much time on them, so people were not as clear on those. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a very good job of teaching exactly what it said it would teach, and making game theory, which generally is fairly dry, really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not well organized to facilitate the process of learning. ",
            "\u00a0The connection between these concepts and the real world seems very small. To use a 3x3 grid to explain things like the attack on Pearl Harbor feels somewhat strange. I did not find these explanations or analyses to be satisfactory and it seems that this course is an attempt to make the Global Affairs major a more quantitative based study. This attempt is feels quite futile. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting material, enthusiastic professor/TA's\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the connections between game theory and the IR material seemed a tad \"stretchy\" but I feel that is understandable given the game theory was basically intro level. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very knowledgeable, however, the course material is underdeveloped in that there aren't a lot of practice questions except for the PSETs. ",
            "\u00a0The history is interesting and the theory is boring. ",
            "\u00a0I think at times there was a disconnect between the math and the real life applications. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting in its integration of traditional theory and history. However, the coursework leading up to the midterm exam did not represent the objectives covered by the exam. In this, I felt the assessment was unfair. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like there is a lot of focus on the Game Theory without a ton of discussion on how to connect game theory with the international relations concepts covered. I wish there was a bit more of a challenge to design/consider games from scratch to describe IR situations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, interesting historical and current cases in international relations, game theory concepts are well-taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some problem set problems are much more difficult than anything taught in class, could be improved by more in-class examples, extra notes, or more TA office hours ",
            "\u00a0Most of what I gained from this course I gained in section. That's not necessarily a bad thing (I still learned a lotand felt like I got from this course what I wanted to), but, if the course is to continue like this (with basic material and problem-solving most effectively covered in section), it means (a) TFs have to do a good job (like mine did), (b) lectures might be better-spent on exploring more historical examples, research, etc.\r\n\r\nI hate to be a stickler like this, but the grading structure of the course was also somewhat frustrating. The work was appropriately (not incredibly) challenging, but the relatively high cutoffs for A- and A grades combined with the small number of points available for the course (30 pts on a midterm, 40 on a final, only five psets, etc.) meant that it felt very difficult to improve (i.e. the marginal return from extra effort studying, working on psets, etc. was usually too low to encourage engagement at the level that this course probably deserves).

The course basically covers what it is titled after: game theory in international relations. The concepts are not the most intuitive at first so one should expect a learning curve, but if this topic is something they would be interested in, the course will provide such. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof Debs is a grear instructor, although I recommend shopping the TF's sections since having a TF whose teaching style works with your learning style for the discussion sections are critical to really understanding the game theory part. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student, unless you must take it to fulfill a requirement for the Global Affairs major. While this class sounds interesting in theory, it does not work well in execution. Not enough emphasis and time was spent on the mathematical components of game theory, and when problems were reviewed together in class, the steps proved very confusing because they were reviewed too quickly, or mistakes were made and the professor would backtrack in problems. Ultimately, we were given very difficult questions in the problem sets and on the exams, which was unfair to ask given the basics we learned in class. Essentially, we were taught the very basics of game theory in class, and then asked extremely difficult questions on the exams, which required us to make huge leaps that we just weren't ready for. ",
            "\u00a0Not as a QR, but if you are passionate about game theory I think this course could be a good start. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who has fairly strong quantitative and qualitative skills. This course will reward those with advanced mathematical abilities who also take the time to do the readings and take comprehensive notes on them. This is not an easy class. The exams are hard, but graded fairly but were unfortunately not like the psets or practice exams. The units after the midterm are fairly complicated, so do your best not to fall behind! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it's good to take Game Theory if you're a social science person. You need to understand the logic of strategic interaction. This class is not very math heavy, however, so if you want a more rigorous theoretical/mathematical experience maybe try econ 159 or 351. ",
            "\u00a0If you do, talk to the TA's real early ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel that it is an attempt to explain something (IR) with a language (game theory) that is unsuited to the task. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It was a great way to understand both the fundamentals of game theory and how it applies to international developments. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended for any student who want a real work application of Game Theory. it could be tough, but worth. ",
            "\u00a0If it weren't a requirement for the global major I wouldn't have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a knowledge of game theory is useful, but those looking to take the course solely out of interest in IR should look elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this if you want very rigorous game theory/math, nor should you take this if you want deep IR discussion. Due to this class serving in part as an intro to both it doesn't get very deep into these schools of thought. If you are a poly sci major that wants to develop more mathematical aptitude I think this is a good option. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because you learn to really understand the game theory models that you see used in political science papers. Game theory is also a really interesting and important way to analyze real-life situations, especially in international relations. "
