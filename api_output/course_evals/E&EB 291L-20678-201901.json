            "\u00a0A great introduction to comparative anatomy, no previous knowledge required. The class was very engaging and hands on. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the functional anatomical differences among vertebrates and how to dissect them. ",
            "\u00a0This class exposed me to dissection techniques and allowed me to visualize structures and tissues we discussed in the lecture course. I feel much more familiar with the inner anatomical workings of many vertebrates after this course. ",
            "\u00a0How to begin a dissection; how to look at and observe what I was seeing; homologies between different species "

            "\u00a0This course is extremely interesting, but sometimes the lab reports simply felt like busy work. There was very little critical thinking involved in them. ",
            "\u00a0The reports often called for information not directly covered by or related to what we did in lab (or in the book). That was challenging. However, the course gave great insight into vertebrate anatomy. Dr. Yohe's pre-lab summaries were also great. ",
            "\u00a0In the last few dissections (in the anthro building), there was very little guidance which meant that I didnt learn much until the write up. For those specific labs, it might have been nice to do the write up before hand because the actual lab didnt contribute much to the write up, but knowing the material in the write up would have made the lab more meaningful. Spring break might be a good place to make the switch. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to dissect animals! It's the only possible laboratory exposure to anatomy you can get in the college so if you're interested in it. ",
            "\u00a0This is such a good biology lab! Especially for somebody who is premed, I found this much more valuable than a microbiology course because you get to interact with whole organism anatatomy. "
