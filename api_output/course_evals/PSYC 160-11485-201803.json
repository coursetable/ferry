We covered topics like stress, attention, hunger/satiety, vision, hearing, somatosensory systems, sleep, etc. This is a good class to learn about the different regions of the brain, their functions, their locations, etc. A lot of cool studies included in lecture about what happens when areas get damaged (e.g. acquired psychopathy, agnosia, agraphia, simultagnosia, visual field deficits, etc.). How do people behave when there is damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex? Hippocampus? Basal Ganglia? Amygdala? ",

I couldn't have been more wrong; I found this class to be extremely intellectually stimulating. I gained so much insight from the case studies McCarthy brought up each lecture about how localized the brain really is. Yet, there exists the capability for the brain to become equipotential when necessary, like what we see following amputation. This is without question the most interesting thing I have learned at Yale, and I can't wait to share this, along with the many other things I learned during the semester, with my family during Winter Break.

Structure and function of various brain parts, research on higher-level processes, and theories of really cool stuff from dreaming to emotions were all covered; also various types of disorders, and hallmark research methods. Prof. McCarthy clearly knows his stuff and works hard to keep the class at the cutting edge of research, which I really admired. Coming in with no neuroscience (or otherwise life science) background, I am leaving with insights about what might be going on inside our brains in different situations, as well as even more curiosity about what the \"mind\" really is. This course also taught me how to study and otherwise stay afloat amid such a huge mountain of information. I found the material complementary to Intro CogSci as well as Intro Psych. ",

            "\u00a0It was too much material. I think this class could have been better if he allowed for questions in class and scheduled required sections to allow students to engage with the material an extra time to solidify it in our minds. I would also have really appreciated it if we had taken the last week to review the material instead of learning new material. Also, there was a lack of transparency as relating to grades which was annoying and unnecessary. The professor did not respond to grade questions on Piazza and the TAs took weeks to grade the qsets. A practice exam before the exam would have given us a better idea of what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly quizzes were a strength of the course. I think a weakness was the lack of communication between the TF's and the students. ",
            "\u00a0It's a large lecture course. The lectures are dry, but if you're interested in the material, it shouldn't be so terrible.\r\nThe weekly qsets are helpful review tools and aren't too much of a burden either. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the layout of the course right now with the qsets on canvas. The polleverywhere was a little weird to work with, but I think it worked out in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely knowledgeable professor, not that much work week-by-week\r\nWeaknesses: incredible amount of information for the final, can be more specific on what we should know for the final ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - McCarthy is a fantastic lecturer. The online quizzes were much nicer than a midterm. \r\nWeaknesses - The grading was incredibly slow. McCarthy chose studies he liked and then expected you to know them, but it was a bit all over the place. It was definitely not organized well. The \"review sessions\" were not helpful for most students because they were during other class times. It was an insane amount of material for 1 exam, a midterm would break it up. Also, a midterm would be very difficult. I see the reason for the open note quizzes, but they do get you because the final is not open note. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well taught and organized thanks to Professor McCarthy. I think it covered a good amount of material and detail. The weekly open-book qsets were not too much of a burden and were definitely helpful for reviewing and knowing what kind of information we were responsible for knowing. It might be nice to have some kind of midterm though, just so the final doesn't seem as daunting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the content is interesting, the notes and slides being uploaded is very useful \r\nWeaknesses are that its a lot of content and there were moments things were mentioned that we never heard about. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course content is super interesting  and the structure is good but I found it hard to retain so much information for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the material--it's fascinating to learn about. Prof. McCarthy does a good job of explaining concepts and providing in-depth lecture notes to supplement the lecture slides (both posted online). Grading for this class is very fair in my opinion. 65% of your grade is dependent on 3-hour, timed \"question sets\" which are open note and online. Prof. McCarthy also does a lot in making sure students can get help (TONS of review sessions which go a long way)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that there is no midterm, and it can be really hard to know how to study for the final exam (since the class grade is nearly only participation, q-sets, and final). ",
            "\u00a0This class was great! Professor McCarthy is wonderful and held plenty of review sessions. The content is fast based and interesting so you are constantly engaged. Most of the grade comes from open book question sets so that was really nice.\r\nI can't think of many weaknesses but it may have been nice to have a midterm or a practice exam just so we knew what to expect on the final. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is the professor -- McCarthy. Even though this was a lecture, every class just felt so incredibly engaging, and there wasn't a single class I didn't look forward to going to. I especially loved the notes that McCarthy made and attached before each lecture, it was a great was to read up on what was going to be taught ahead of time and it made it easier to follow along during lecture. I think a weakness of the class is that there wasn't a midterm for this class. While I understand and agree that the q-sets made it so that we were engaged with the material every week, the fact that the final was cumulative for the entire year made it one of the most daunting tests I have ever taken. If a few q-sets were replaced with one midterm that made the final cumulative for just the second half of the semester, I would have liked the class even more. ",
            "\u00a0While it was nice to not have a midterm, having only open note qsets made the final very anxiety inducing as there was only guesswork as to how to prepare. Although it would make the course harder, having closed note qsets (and some way of enforcing that) would encourage studying earlier on and make the qsets more effective for learning throughout the semester.\r\n\r\n It would be useful if, at the beginning of the semester when we learn anatomy, we were provided with some blank images and answer keys to practice labeling at the level we are expected to learn the anatomy so that it would be easier to study and absorb the anatomical information throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There were a lot of resourcesslides, notes, videos. Very interesting topics that made each lecture worth going to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of memorization involved, but that's not so much a weakness of the course as something to be aware of when taking it. ",
            "\u00a0This course attempts to cover an insane amount of material. While you do end up learning a lot, the combination of depth and breadth makes the course quite overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0It was nice to not have a midterm. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly dense, with tons of material to cover; it's very ambitious. Yes, we do cover lots of material, but I think in some ways it may too much (especially when it comes to studying for the final). I appreciated the open-note Q-sets and the way they had me try to synthesize the material and challenge my thinking (beyond rote copying of notes). I honestly wish there was more of that -- more creative problem-solving. I really appreciated the posting and writing of the lecture notes, as they offered a terrific accompaniment to the material in class. The hard part with having so much material, particularly words and terms, is that it's conducive to rote memorization learning, which I don't think is effective. The best parts are the synthesizing and comparing of material (like the cross-topics, which I wish had been more integrated throughout the semester). \r\n\r\nIn some ways, I actually wish there were some sort of mid-term, that we might have preparation for the final and know how the professor preferred to test his students. Poll everywhere was also fun, though I wish there was actually more of that at the end of the class (like an \"exit slip\"). ",
            "\u00a0too much info!! \r\nliked the qsets though\r\nalso appreciated how he'd give us the lecture notes and slides and upload videos of his lectures ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, I think Professor McCarthy did a great job of covering a lot of material in not a lot of time, and his lecture notes were extremely helpful for completing the weekly qsets and studying for the final. That being said, preparing for the final is quite difficult since there is no prior cumulative assessment. I like that the weekly qsets are a more low-stress form of assessment, but I think it could be beneficial to still have a midterm as a way to break up the material and see how you are doing before the end of the semester. I also think we could benefit from a more thorough treatment of the anatomy of the brain. ",
            "\u00a0The professor provides a lot of resources, with lecture notes and powerpoints, but the amount of resources is overwhelming to the point that students do not know where to direct their attention when studying. Also, the lack of practice tests provided for the final was extremely detrimental. Seeing as this is an intro level course, the professor should not assume knowledge of certain concepts within biology and chemistry, courses which some students have not taken since freshman year of high school. The Q-Sets also took way too long to get back and the feedback was less helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The QSETs were actually amazing in terms of facilitating learning, since I would do as much work as I would for a regular quiz, but also be able to really understand what important concepts were to focus on, rather than memorizing and forgetting right after. The final, however, I believe was still too much... it didn't seem to be a fair assessment of student knowledge or learning in the course (especially the anatomy questions with the barely discernible pictures...). I also wish I was told to not focus too much on the readings in advance because they weren't very useful in adding to my understanding, compared to the countless hours I wasted trying to do them. ",
            "\u00a0The professor presents students with an overwhelming amount of information from day 1. This does not feel like an introductory class in the slightest. The level of detail is too much. Every two classes felt like at least a month's worth of material with how much he covered in a single lecture. Instead of feeling engaged and intrigued, it is more so stressful when thinking about the final. ",
            "\u00a0Very well structured and organized. McCarthy is an incredible lecturer and knowledgable the material as well as up to date on interesting literature updates. The only problem I have is that he often times lectures quite slowly which can lull me to sleep but his online videos allow me to relearn any information I may have missed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I though I would hate the qsets, ended up liking them. Lectures are dense but super interesting and Mccarthy clearly knows his stuff\r\n\r\nWeakness: as I said above, lectures are dense (and fast). If youre a poor note taker, you might get steamrolled. However, he posts detailed lecture notes online and posts videos of the lectures ",
            "\u00a0There is so much material. The notes and videos of each lecture were helpful, but it was so much information it was near impossible to know it all for the final. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-structured. Prof. McCarthy provides not just the lecture slides but also lecture notes, re-synthesized to complement the lectures. He is a good lecturer, and seemed to have a good sense of how well we were following each lecture. In general, it is very apparent that he cares a lot about teaching. Active participation was maintained to some degree with polls during lecture; diagrams and images were helpful; everything taught is kept at the forefront of research; there were a few review sessions throughout the semester, each of which summarized the past few lectures but also discussed bigger-picture themes that were happening across lectures; and we had a Piazza, which Prof. McCarthy encouraged us to use. (In the last lecture, he told us he would be \"living on Piazza\" in the next week leading up to the final. What a champ.) At the beginning of the course, I found myself overwhelmed by just how many different ways there were to access course content. Some more specific guidance on how to approach the textbook chapters, outside readings, lecture notes, lecture slides might have been nice. Also, although it is a strength that Prof. McCarthy does not rely on a textbook for this course, I wish the course had been more clear about to what extent the (expensive) textbook would be actually be needed. I barely used mine, and never found myself truly needing it. Finally, on the qsets: I liked them. Three hours a week isn't a small chunk, but it forced me to pace myself and consume course content in bits. They also allowed us to receive feedback on our thinking/responses fairly quickly throughout the semester. ...HOWEVER, going into the final having never done a closed-book assessment was stressful. If this format remains in the future, make sure you will have plenty of study time during reading week, or otherwise don't rely on open notes for the qsets. These small quibbles aside: overall, this was one of the best-taught courses I've taken here. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material is pretty interesting, and the professor is actually kind of funny sometimes, which I think is good for engagement. The Poll Everywhere was also good for engagement because it let you check in with what you knew and also it was funny watching everyone change their answers once the right answer was projected up on the screen. The weekly Qsets(canvas quizzes) were good for making sure you actually understood what was talked about in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Even with interesting material and good engagement in lecture, it's still very easy to check out with this class. My main problem was I was able to do the Qsets every week by just reading over the lecture notes and slides (that were posted before every lecture, actually very helpful resource), and come time for the final I had none (very little) of the material actually memorized. ",
            "\u00a0Professor McCarthy truly provides everything you could possibly need for the course, with the lectures recorded and how he provides notes you will always have sufficient information to complete the qSets. ",
            "\u00a0Psets are open note and count for a majority of the grade, but you have to study throughout the course, otherwise you'll be cramming a lot for the final and will not do well. ",
            "\u00a0The online polling was confusing but I think it was resolved well by counting 80% participation as full participation. Having filmed lectures was great because I could go back and watch them on 2x speed. The material was fascinating and the instructors were quick to respond to piazza questions. I would have liked more clarity about the depth/detail that we were expected to know on the final. ",
            "\u00a0I wish less time was spent on single topics (is., the visual pathway) and that the course was organized in a way that is a little more intuitive. But overall a great course. The instructor tries very hard to give students lots of opportunities to review and learn, and he is clearly incredibly knowledgeable. I would get rid of PollEverywhere for the course. It doesnt benefit it. ",
            "\u00a0Okay so this whole 10 Qset format is difficult. The fact that they're open note means that you don't learn anything unless you keep up with the material, so by the end of the semester you've done well on the open note qsets but you're literally spook'd for the final and know nothing. I guess it should work out in the end because percentage-wise the qsets are worth so much more, and if even you fail the final you should still do well in the class? a thot to consider \r\n\r\nalso it moves at a very fast pace because you learn literally everything about the brain which is cool but you oftentimes can't keep up. I'm coming to this class from a more biology-like angle so I could deal with the neuroscience but half the people were very wary in the first couple of weeks. there's no prerequisite for this but some people were shook.\r\n\r\nalso this is really an intro class like it's intro neurobiology at the beginning and intro social psych by the end of the semester so it does a good job accurately encompassing everything about the brain but it's a lot ",
            "\u00a0This class is confusing for a few reasons.  The readings don't always seem necessary, and it's really hard to be ready for a cumulative final when all we have before are weekly take-home open-book quizzes.  I think if there was some way that we could have a better idea of the final would be like, everyone would feel better about. ",
            "\u00a0Gregory McCarthy is a great lecturer who is one of the most knowledgeable researchers in the field. I did not have any issues with the way the course was presented, although a lot of people had trouble because major topics were skipped over quickly just because there was so much to cover. A big strength would be that the course has a lot to offer for anybody who is interested in the brain, neuroscientist or not. However, a weakness may be that there is just so much material that a lot of those people who aren't fascinated in the subject might get discouraged. Grading was not an issue for these people though because the class was based 60% on open note homeworks and 10% on participation (which was not graded well at first but they fixed it due to technological difficulties. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organised (lectures were recorded, lecture notes were posted, etc.), but the weekly open-note Canvas quizzes don't adequately prepare you for the cumulative final. You have to start studying for that at least a week in advance, and there's a LOT to learn. I think it'd be better if we had some sort of in-class quiz system so that we start having to learn/memorise material earlier on in the semester, or at least not have a cumulative final, because there's honestly too much to learn for one test. ",
            "\u00a0I think the QSets are wonderful and a great way to structure the course. The teaching was phenomenal and I really enjoyed the TAs and Professor McCarthy. The lecture slides and notes were great, but sometimes could have been more updated. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall to learn about the human brain. Accessible to all types of students, but be sure to go to office hours and do all the readings. If you're not putting in work weekly you will fall behind very quickly. ",

            "\u00a0I thought this was about as good of an intro neuroscience class as there could be. Yes, it's a lot of information, but there's no way to \"improve\" that. I think it is structured very well with the weekly question sets. He provides a lot of opportunities and resources to help kids who are struggling: lecture slides, notes, videos, review sessions, textbook, etc. One thing is that we didn't get the feedback on many of our question sets (at least five) until we had finished all of them, which made it difficult to learn from them and apply it to the next one.

Furthermore, between office hours, TAs, and Piazza, there is ample opportunity to get extra help. However, the textbook is several levels of complexity above the course material. Reading it is supposed to provide a context for lecture, but the text is often too difficult to understand. A more simplistic textbook would be more helpful. Rather than confusing the students with highly detailed neurobiology and anatomy, the readings should be at a level of depth similar to lectures. The few papers we read were much better than the textbook; perhaps the textbook should be replaced with readings from primary literature! ",

            "\u00a0This class was great because there were many different methods of learning provided. Videos of the professor's lectures were all posted on Canvas along with his slides and written notes on each lecture. This made it very easy to study and review topics outside of class. There was also the textbook which offered another way to understand the topics - although personally I rarely read the textbook and didn't find it particularly useful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course have to do with the fact that Professor McGregory truly devoted an immense amount of time and energy into making the material as understandable as possible. Neuroscience is not an easy subject to approach so his lectures, videos, reviews, and notes all helped solidify the concepts and explain the material in a way that is approachable even to those who do not have a strong background in science. However, the weakness of the course has to do with the depth that we delved into some areas of discussion, especially coming from a humanities background since some of the detailed systems and anatomical features did not seem absolutely essential to understanding the psychological aspects of cognition. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - GREAT LECTURES, very well structured, very little digressions, review sessions very helpful, office hours were also helpful\r\nweaknesses - would have liked a better form of assessment - the qsets are nice but they don't require all that much critical thinking - an avenue to apply some of the insights we learnt would have been a better form of assessment ",
            "\u00a0Professor McCarthy clearly knows his material and enjoys giving lectures, which makes them fairly enjoyable. His great familiarity with the topics does, however, seem to sometimes get him talking faster than those of us who are just being exposed to the material can keep up with, and there isn't much repetition of, say, names of key areas of the brain, and so if you miss the first mention you might be lost for the rest of the lecture, which I found very frustrating as I tried to take notes about the ______, if I missed the name of an area. Additionally, while there is necessarily a great deal of ground covered in an introductory course, especially on a topic as complex as the brain, I think that tying the material in the first half of the semester, which deals mostly with anatomical information, in with function/psychological information would have been helpful in understanding the anatomy, as it would allow a more natural connection between the content of the first and second half of the course. The weekly quizzes are great, allowing both for weekly review and taking some pressure off on the final. ",

            "\u00a0Professor McCarthy and the TA's did an excellent job providing students with the online resources necessary to keep up with the material and succeed. All the lectures, as well as high quality, in depth lecture notes, were posted online, which was incredibly helpful. This was important, as the class covered a huge amount of material. ",

Although I see the merits of the platform, I personally did not utilize Piazza often and did not find it to be particularly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nWeekly question sets were given, which was a great way to refresh material that was recently learned. Since there was a lot of material covered in class, these were very helpful in refreshing my memory of specific topics. This also made studying for the final exam much easier. All of Professor McCarthy's lecture notes, slides, and recordings of each lecture were posted on Canvas. This was extremely helpful, as I often went to these resources to fill in my notes after class and/or refresh my memory of what was covered in lecture. Often times, I would not understand something in lecture or I would miss something that Professor McCarthy said, so being able to consult his notes and slides outside of class was VERY helpful. When I had to miss class entirely, I was able to listen to the lecture (and follow along with the slides, which were posted along with the audio recording) outside of class, which was extremely helpful. Plus, they were always posted right away, which was very nice. Professor McCarthy also held very comprehensive, in-depth review sessions each week and several right before the final exam, which were very helpful and allowed students to ask any questions they had. Finally, I l really liked that we talked about many experiments in class that were relevant to the topics we covered, as these were very interesting and helped me better understand each concept. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThere was only one test throughout the entire course, which was the final exam. I really feel as though there should have been a mid-term for this course, as this would have effectively refreshed our knowledge of the first half of the term (since there was so much material covered in class) and would have made studying for the final exam much less stressful.

Additionally, the Piazza forum was very actively monitored and questions were adequately addressed. ",

            "\u00a0Compared to the rest of the class, which is open note and a fair difficulty, the final is extremely hard and forces students to memorize an absurd and unreasonable amount of material. It should not be advertised as an introductory class because the level of knowledge a person needs to have to keep up is significant, and the final needs to be limited in some capacity to make preparation possible.

            "\u00a0I think the question sets were a great way to learn the material and apply our knowledge to reinforce what we had learned in lecture. The final exam, though, was impossible. It covered way too much material, and expected us to know everything in very specific detail. ",

            "\u00a0The course is well organized, but it was WAY too much material. I learned a lot, but it would have been more than enough with half of the material. Because the class covered so many topics, I felt like I never fully understood one idea before the professor moved on to the next. I, and I'm sure many others, would have benefited from more attention to fewer important topics. It all seems basic to the professor, but for people who likely have never had a course so specific to the human brain before, it is all very foreign and not so easily internalized the first time around. Also, I felt very unprepared going into the final. Because the class was majority Qsets and participation, I had no idea what to expect for the final. I went to the review sessions both at the end of the term and during and still did not know where my time would be best spent studying. Therefore, I was forced to study everything at a very detailed level for fear that I would be caught off guard during the exam. It was very hard to tell how much of the material I actually understood because all of the QSets were not necessarily testing my knowledge, but rather how well I could look up the answer in the lecture notes, slides, video, or online. I do not necessarily like this type of testing nor do I think that it is a fair representation of my knowledge. I think there may be better ways to structure the course so that students are actually intellectually challenged and not just regurgitating facts. ",

I personally felt that the online graded weekly problem sets didn't facilitate learning that well  you don't really have to study for them, and they end up just being a kind of shallow review of the notes from the previous week. I think that some sort of midterm or other thing where you have to study might be beneficial, because when I got to reading period and the final I just felt thoroughly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information I had to review because there was no previous point during the semester where I had to thoroughly go over material. That being said, during the semester the class is only 2.5 hours a week of work it's just studying for the final that is rough. I'm worried that the class was a little bit too much cramming and that I won't really retain the information. That being said, I personally found the lectures very interesting and informative. Greg does a great job of bringing in current research and giving a fair representation of competing ideas in the field. I do wish the class focused a bit less on psychology and more on biology, but that's more of a personal preference. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. McCarthy is highly knowledgeable and blows you away each lecture with the complexity of the human brain's physiology and functions. There are plenty of office hours each week, and TAs are very responsive and helpful with any concerns. Weaknesses: brace yourself for being surrounded by pre-meds who a little too panicked about perfection. I am not a science major and took this class for a SC credit, and this part was quite annoying. Also be wary of the HUGE amount of information that is thrown at you. I was drowning in notes that were not possible to remember. The weekly Q-Set is not enjoyable to do at all because it is timed. Once you start the timer, be prepared to perhaps be buckled down for the next three hours. However, I appreciate the fact that the Q-Sets counted for a majority of the final grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The information is all really interesting, and the workload is very manageable with weekly qsets that are open-note.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was some way to engage more deeply with the material, perhaps with sections or something of that sort, or lectures with more interactive experiences. Its difficult for me to retain information when I'm just being talked at, so having perhaps a sort of project to do with a group or something more engaging during the semester (like a midterm project) would have helped me learn better. ",

While he is right that I was somewhat familiar with the terms, I by no means understood or could identify the different brain parts just by hearing him mention them (often by one of their various names) a couple times throughout the semester. I wish he had devoted time to familiarizing ourselves with general structure before going into specifics. I ultimately rewatched all the lectures and suddenly understood so much better. ",

However, because there was no midterm nor practice final exams, i had no idea what the exam would look like which gave me anxiety, especially considering the exam was cumulative of all 26 lectures, all VERY dense and filled with so much information. There was not much preparation for the final which was worrisome. Additionally, he isn't that great at engaging the class which did the complete opposite of engage me and turned me away in fact. One way he would engage us was with the \"poll everywhere\" questions which were simply to difficult to answer and thus participate and overall felt useless to our engagement and active learning in the course.

The grading for this class is VERY FAIR. The harder you work, the better your grade will be. If you put in the time to study for the exam, it is NOT HARD TO GET AN A GRADE. Prof. McCarthy never will curve down (potentially may curve up), and if everyone works hard and deserves an \"A,\" he promises that he would give everyone an A. At the end of the day, it is a very interesting course, and a very fair course grade-wise. I'm saying this as a student who was VERY busy during finals, and I didn't get to study enough for the final (i.e., probably didn't get an A), and I am still willing to say that it is fair. If I had studied more and memorized more material, I know I could have done better on the exam. In other words, this is just a class where you will need to put in the work to study and memorize the material, but once you do, it is not a hard class to do well in. Given that it is quite an interesting topic for many people, I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND it! :) Prof. McCarthy is also a good lecturer and tries to make sure the class is fun and engaging.

            "\u00a0It's hard to say. Yes, if one wants exposure to learning about all the different parts of the brain (in a survey sense), but no if you'd like something more targeted and specified. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The material is so fascinating and so fundamental to understanding how the mind works, and Professor McCarthy does a good job of explaining tough concepts clearly and thoroughly. The day-to-day workload is not that high since the weekly qsets are open book, but that being said, this makes preparing for the final at the end of the semester pretty hard because of the sheer volume of material to know and because of the lack of prior assessment. Still, I would say the amount of cool stuff about the brain that you'll understand by the end of the semester outweighs how hard studying for the final is. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to students pursuing a neuroscience major. If you are a psychology major you will feel extremely lost because the professor does not explain the scientific concepts nearly well enough. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning alot about the workings of the brain, this is an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! No prerequisites, info that everyone should know. If you are bio, psych, cog sci, neuro, etc. its a must. If you arent, but want to take a legit science credit instead of something gutty, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I only took it because I had to for my major. It is way too much material, and the final was brutal. I dreaded going every week and it got no better, it was just so boring and difficult to get engaged in even though it was a TON of material. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly encourage anyone with an interest in the brain/mind to take this course, if their schedule allows. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I did actually really like the material and while the Qsets were kind of difficult it was only 1-2 hours out of my week each week. Plus the Qsets are 65% of the grad, participation 10%, so if you go to lecture and do well on the qsets you don't have to worry too much about the final. Definitely would recommend if you just want to get a science credit out of the way. ",
            "\u00a0Depends, as a history major looking for a science credit it was definitely interesting but the final wrecked me to the highest degree. Studying for the final should take your entire reading period. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, all lectures are posted along with slides and notes he makes for you. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to a student interested in anatomy and neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0As a NSCI major you have to do it. I think for Psych it's an elective, and if you really kinda want a neuro class that talks about imaging and circuitry then sure take it ",
            "\u00a0If you are up for memorizing a lot about the human brain, then I say take the class. If you want to learn more generally about the brain, I would take intro psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this course unless you have to. ",
            "\u00a0I have mixed feelings about this course. It was really challenging at the end and trying to keep up the interest and focus throughout the year in order to be ready for the final was hard to do.  I think this course is highly informative, but it's also really weirdly organized.  I didn't feel prepared for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-it's my favorite class at Yale that I've taken. As a neuroscience major, this class makes me feel prepared for the rest of the track and very excited to go through with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think its a great introductory course and a strong science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend. You come away with such a depth of knowledge about such a cool subject. It makes you a better consumer of science and student of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - definitely helpful if you're interested in neuroscience. It was much more technical than I'm used to and prefer, but taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a great intro neuroscience class, but know what you're getting yourself into. It is a lot of information. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It gives so much important and also interesting facts about the brain. It's difficult, but you will come out with a lot of information. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You do learn a lot, although are only really motivated to do so before the final exam, as the Qset style of grading does not encourage deep memorization or learning throughout the semester ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in neuroscience and this type of material, but otherwise it can be difficult to keep up with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for a course about the structure and basic function of the human brain. The course provides a good overview of how sense systems, movement, and motivated behaviors operate. However, if you are interested in higher-level cognition, this course will likely leave you unsatisfied. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the right level of challenging and rewarding. I learned a lot and enjoyed the material, lectures, and professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but the TAs can be very picky when grading qsets even though they are grad neuroscience students whereas this is an intro course ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. While I enjoyed the material because I love neuroscience, the course is poorly organized for student learning. The professor tries to cover too much information and it takes forever to receive feedback on problem sets (they were about 6 weeks behind in grading problem sets which are given weekly). ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I was hesitant to take this course earlier because I hadn't had a Biology course since.. forever, but Professor McCarthy is really good at explaining even the most confusing parts of the course! I never felt lost, but I must confess, if I hadn't read the lecture notes beforehand, it would've been tough. Everything we learned was very interesting and Professor McCarthy does everything he can and more to provide support. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if you have interest in learning about each part of the brain - it included a lot of anatomy. I found all the interactions between each brain structure very engaging. This class also had a huge focus on the impacts of lesions to different parts of the brain and the corresponding effects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you are interested in understanding the neuroscience behind facets of human psychology and cognition, but be prepared for the workload and the challenging material! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!\r\ncore course for both psychology and neuroscience students ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class on a few conditions: 1) it is required for your major or 2) you really love the brain. Otherwise, unless you find some other way to make yourself really devoted to it, you might get the same sort of information (say, if you're interested in just one aspect of brain function or psychology) from a more focused course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you actively make an effort to learn the material on your own every week ",
            "\u00a0Take if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the human brain/neuroscience, this is definitely the course. It does cover a genuinely massive amount of material, so be prepared to keep over the semester, or spend a huge amount of time reviewing for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you arent interested in the brain, this class provides important insights for the best way to live. I would recommend it to all. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course enthusiastically. The subject matter is accessible, engaging, and relevant. The workload facilitates learning, and the course expectations are manageable for non-science and science majors alike. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! If you are interested in the brain this course is perfect for you. You will learn a lot, and I think it serves as a great introductory neuroscience course, so if you are unsure about whether or not you want to pursue neuroscience as a major, this would probably be a good class to take to start out with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a wonderful, comprehensive introduction to a beautiful part of the human body. You not only learn a lot of information, but you also learn a lot about how to study, how to critique arguments, and how to structure your thoughts in a way that ties things together. You learn how to parse information for big ideas rather than just memorizing it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to learn more about the brain, this is a great way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, provides a comprehensive explanation of the brain and puts tempo of learning in the hands of the student through recording the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting overview of the mechanisms of the brain. Class was well organized with plenty of online resources (lecture videos, class notes, lecture slides, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I took it because I was interested in some of the material and thought it would be a nice introduction to many of the topics I wanted to learn about, but it turned out to be one of the fastest moving, most information heavy, and most technical courses I have ever taken. Only take this course if you are a neuroscience major and absolutely love memorizing material about it ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course will teach you an immense amount of information in a short amount of time. You leave this class feeling like you learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0No. If you dont have to take it, dont. You probably wont enjoy it because its extremely dry and the final is terribly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if youre willing to take time each week to study and memorize content. Its too much to cram at the end of the semester before the exam. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if youre thinking of majoring in Psych or Cognitive Science ",
            "\u00a0Not a gut. ",
            "\u00a0If you're the type of student who has a lot of self-motivation and will study in lieu of upcoming examinations then yes, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a fast-paced tour of the human brain and a solid introduction to how we study it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if youre interested in the brain! I am an MB&B major so I did not need this course at all, but I was very happy to take it. However, be careful because the final was very difficult! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah but don't expect to do well unless you can put a ton of time into every Qset ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially a psychology major. It is well designed to teach someone important information about the human mind who has never learned neuroscience before. ",
            "\u00a0Depends. Definitely don't take it if you are lookin for an easy science credit because it is not one. You will leave feeling more satisfied and challenged than if you had taken a gut, but be prepared to stress about the exams and you know nothing when you actually might. If you have to take the course for some requirement, just be prepared to work hard. I think it is a better option if you truly want to learn something and especially relevant considering we all have brains, and it is nice to have some idea about what is going on in there. I am thankful I took the course, but I do not know if I would put myself through all of that again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is definitely not a gut. A lot of work. But worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not if you're looking for a science gut, but the material really is fascinating and relevant even if you're not a Psych or Neuro major. It's not too much work (besides studying for the final), and overall I'm very glad I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in getting to know more about the physical anatomy of the brain or is looking into pursuing neuroscience. The course is content heavy and may intimidate or not be for individuals who are looking to gain some general exposure to neurobiology. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who need this class for a requirement. If you are merely interested in learning about the brain, this course is much too dense and difficult. However, you will learn a lot if you feel the need. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has to take it. If you are a psychology or neuro major then by all means take it, but this is not an enjoyable fun psychology course to take randomly. I would not take this as a science credit for non science students. At the end, you will have to cram really really hard for the final. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have the burning desire to learn about the brain, like I did. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it's really interesting, but make sure that you are a self-directed learner, because you're otherwise screwed for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - interesting but make sure to study throughout the semester ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good survey neuro class. Not very well taught/organized in that there is too much material and we jump around a bit. Although, I think that isn't the fault of Prof. McCarthy who does his best to organize each lecture thematically. However, I think he should cover much less material and we would be able to dive into the topics a bit better . ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. No part of me felt prepared for really anything despite attending all of the lectures, and I've heard similar things from other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless required for major since it took a lot of time to prepare for the exam and the weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0No because it was challenging and boring. It if it were not as boring, I would recommend it, but if you are not engaged in the material it is not really worth the challenge. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless it's a prerequisite I would not, because although it may be interesting and full of cool facts and concepts its simply too dense to get through without having anxiety. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Definitely a ton of memorization, but the workload during the semester itself is not too bad. You learn quite a few very interesting things, and I walked away with a solid understanding of pretty much every component of the human brain. Professor McCarthy is excellent, and you can tell he really cares about the students in the class (he holds many review sessions and is very active on Piazza). "
