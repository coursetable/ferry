            "\u00a0The capstone course was a great culminating experience for health policy students. Whereas the thesis is this experience for all other concentrations, the capstone project was for us. I appreciate that this course provided us with policy analysis paradigms and persuasion tools that will be effective upon entering the real world public health setting. Furthermore, I appreciate that the final policy brief project allowed students to select a topic of their choice and really use passion-drive arguments to attempt to instill change. As for ways the course may be improved, perhaps an earlier time of the day when students are more engaged. Also, the class time prevented students from taking elective courses they really wanted (e.g. political epidemiology, health law). ",
            "\u00a0great ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent readings, usually engaging lectures, and assignments that pushed you to apply concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough opportunity to practice some skills (namely press release writing); Expectations for some assignments not fully clear (specifically morality project--an example piece would have done wonders); discussions tended to be dominated by the same few voices, as always.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I might recommend that Professor modify his syllabus slightly so as to encourage more reading. I got the feeling that many folks were turned off by the dense, often theoretical literature. I think those readings are necessary, I just wonder if there's ways to ease the burden, either by providing students with specific pages/passages to focus on or by highlighting one 'must read.' ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! The readings are interesting and relevant, and Mark pushes you to think about topics and concepts that are complex and thought provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mark is a fantastic teacher \r\nWeaknesses: I think we should have certain points of our capstone due throughout the semester. Also, more guidance on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0More practically-based exercises could be helpful. Also, the set-up of the classroom wasnt conducive to discussion. Having us sit in a circle and facing each other mightve forced more participation. Something to consider for next year! ",
            "\u00a0I think that a capstone course is a very valuable exercise, but I dont think we learned skills that are going to be helpful in our careers in policy ",
            "\u00a0Extremely tight and incisive course. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was an appropriate culmination to the health policy concentration. Although I think it was very helpful in teaching us  how to shape our conversations in healthy policy and what type of paradigm to adapt to, there could be more work in the area of practicing the practical aspect of it. I feel that we were too rushed in how to create a press release and understand how to differentiate between creating pieces for the public versus for the legislators and could benefit from more of it so that we are prepared to enter into the real world of addressing both groups of people. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: taking difficult considerations and bringing them to the fore. Giving us good frameworks through which to view our future careers. \r\nWeaknesses: a little more guidance on the final assignment might have helped me feel more confident in my final product. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: course materials should be updated to this decade. ",
            "\u00a0Heavy on the policy theory but interesting! ",

            "\u00a0I think this was the perfect course to wrap up our two years as policy students. I could directly apply what I was learning in the classroom to my assignments for this class, other classes, and my practicum. ",
            "\u00a0Please update readings so they are more recent case studies and publications--too many readings were from the 1990s and 2000s. Please also update handouts so that data is recent. Pare down readings and just focus on case studies, not policy theory.  \r\n\r\nI did not find the health policy paradigm framework of the course helpful. I would rather learn hard skills, like drafting health policy memos, then debate concepts like policy paradigms. I don't think I will use policy \"theory\" in my future career, so it did not feel useful to study. ",
            "\u00a0It seems like a lot of the topics were highly repetitive with other classes. The class would be more productive if it were a seminar, so that only students interested in the key topics would take it and therefore have a more lively class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were unproductive, and much of the time was spent on the professor trying to fish out a particular answer from us and dismissing perspectives other than his own. I also think that most of the coursework could have been condensed into a shorter class period or into a half-semester course. ",
            "\u00a0I was incredibly disappointed with the quality of the capstone class. To be honest, I'm not even really sure what the point of the class was and what I was supposed to be taking away from this class. A lot of what we learned in class was very theoretical, which is the opposed of what a capstone class usually is. I had hoped we would learn more practical skills for writing health policy such as maybe how to write a testimony. I get that our assignments were meant to get us to write policies from different perspectives, but some of the assignments just seemed pointless such as the marijuana legalization one. It was just such an unrealistic topic that it made the assignment disinteresting. If I had known the capstone class was supposed to be a culmination of my health policy concentration for my MPH, I probably would have chosen to do a thesis. The final capstone paper felt so rushed and we got very little guidance or feedback that I felt most students weren't able to give it the justice we wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: theoretical deep dive into policy work that every health policy student should know to graduate and work in policy. Challenging assignments that push students to adopt different analyses styles to deliver the best policy analysis or persuasive argument.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the examples used are a bit out of date. Given the drastic policy shifts of the Trump administration, the course could easily draw from more current health policy examples. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very interesting and allows us policy students to look at different issues through a variety of lenses. I really enjoyed how Mark pushed all of us to look at things from different perspectives. "

For instance, if the class was quiet after he asked a question, he didn't continue to press for an answer. He will also super available to students via email and in-person meeting times. As for improvements, perhaps a little faster grading. However, I do know that Mark grades slowly because of his thoroughness with student's work. ",

He is never the kind of teacher that will tell you that you're wrong for the answer you give, but help you think through it which is very encouraging. Also, his feedback is great and I appreciate that he's accommodating with deadlines. I also appreciate the significant amount of time we spend on learning about religious influences in health policy, as they are so important. \r\nWeaknesses: Cannot think of any because Mark is always willing to help as long as you ask.

Sometimes it was a little frustrating when his response to answers from the class was to undermine the answer with another consideration.  I'm not sure exactly what else should be done, but it felt a little un-engaging sometimes. Perhaps asking for answers to a question and what considerations the students have about their answer might be better? ",

Great at leading class discussion.\r\n\r\nI am sure this is unintentional, but Mark does have a tendency to interrupt students while they are speaking in class. I know Mark absolutely respects his students and it is inadvertent, but just something to be aware of. ",

            "\u00a0While Mark is clearly very knowledgable and an expert in his field, and he is really great one-on-one. However, in class when he would ask a question and a student would provide an answer, unless it was an answer he wanted to hear, it would be shot down. He didn't even try to engage the student or challenge the student to think further, instead he would move on and try to fish around for the answer he thought was right. It made many students wish to not even participate or engage in class discussions, and for that reason many of us stopped showing up to class. ",

He will always find a way to look at something that you would have never considered, which really assists students in our growth.  He is the perfect professor to teach this class and I always enjoy working and speaking with him. "
