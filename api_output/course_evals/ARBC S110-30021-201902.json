            "\u00a0I learned so much about the arabic language and about how to use circumlocution when I don't know exactly how to express myself. ",
            "\u00a0!  \r\nI was able to learn basic Arabic vocabulary and grammar, as well as how to say basic phrases. Even though this course was only 5 weeks, I was able to go from no Arabic to a) learning the alphabet, b) learning basic phrases, and c) to being able to be slightly (though I mean only slightly) conversational. As I continue taking Arabic, I'm sure that I will gain a great understanding of the language by the time I am done. "

            "\u00a0This course was amazing. Professor Aziz was incredibly engaging and I like how the course followed the textbook while also branching off from the rigid curriculum in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor is wonderful, the method of learning this language is really nice (and you get to practice a lot), and the speed in which the course travels means that you will show improvement very rapidly and you will really get to learning Arabic quickly. Plus, you don't have to focus on other courses, so you get to be very focused. Also, due to the nature of summer session, less people take the course, so you get much more one-to-one contact with your professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: simply because it is a five-week course, it moves quickly and at times is hard to digest. There is a ton of homework, and it can be hard to finish it all all the time. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Aziz was hilarious and amazing and arabic is a fascinating language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though I would caution the student to live off campus with friends because that's where most Yale students live for the summer rather than in the dorms. But the course is really fun, thrilling, and you get to learn Arabic with wonderful professors. "
