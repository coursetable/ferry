            "\u00a0This class was a breath of fresh air. I came into the class confident that I already knew a lot of what the class was going to offer and walked away with so many insights about myself and the world we inhabit. ",
            "\u00a0This class had a very strong syllabus and even stronger professor. ",
            "\u00a0One of the skills most humanity majors at Yale get really good at is critique texts.  In Black Feminist Theory I learned how to build from texts not just tear them down.  I also widened the amount of important articles and books in the field of Afam. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to understand all of the arguments, articles, and ideas present in the canon of Black Feminist Theory, as well as apply these ideas to understanding a wide range of cultural objectswhether biographies, novels, scholarly texts, articles, oral histories, photographs, videos, or music. The class pushed my understanding of my/the individual's positionality within the world and offered me a chance to develop and refine my own ideas, always in conversation with the brilliant ideas of my classmates, the multiple graduate students in the class, and Professor Cox. Students came from diverse backgrounds, and each one brought something unique to discussions. Discussions were fluid and specific, and Professor Cox excelled at keeping us on track and steering talk away from the ultra-theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0Expanding ideas of theory & expanding ideas of \"scholarly\" text. Individual & group work to do so. Insights into the Black Feminist Theory canon & into self. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an amazing opportunity to spend time focused on something that has been in the background of other courses I've taken. It pushed my analytical skills further and helped me improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT SO MANY THINGS! Mainly Black Feminist Theory but the knowledge I gained in this class seeped into my everyday life. I honestly can't say the number of things I approach differently after this course-- life, other academic spaces, friends, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0There were too many people in the class and too many people who didn't consistently come. That made it hard to make a connection with the other students but Professor Cox was a joy to be in seminar with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths, the group work and syllabus. \r\nWeaknesses - the assignments and discussions weren't very engaging. there was too much reading assigned, so everyone did different sections. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed for a ton of individuality without losing sight of academic goals. Professor Cox expertly influenced the class dynamic, and deeply cared about the success and growth of every individual student. The syllabus is stacked with thought-provoking texts that run the gamut in terms of genre and offer great exposure to Black Feminist thought. The trip to New York City was efficiently run and eye-openingprops to Professor Cox for keeping us on track but allowing us to gain greater insight into the historical role/place of Black people in New York City by going on tours of Weeksville and 'Black Gotham,' as well as meeting and eating with a powerful contemporary photographer. A weakness of the course WAS the clique-y nature of some of the students, which created a difficult environment early on, but Professor Cox very successfully combatted this by meeting with students and placing students in groups, allowing us to branch out and meet others. Our location change also allowed the class to shift gears mid-semester! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing syllabus & Professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes loose structure that made for difficulty creating engaging classroom setting ",
            "\u00a0The class is well organized across many different themes that push the boundaries of what black feminist theory is and can be. The materials and organization of the class did shift some, but that was solely due to the class being responsive to the organic direction of the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. Basically because Aimee Cox is amazing. The reading was phenomenal, the course readings and syllabus incredibly interesting. The structure was great. I literally loved it so much. "

            "\u00a0YES! Especially Black women and Black people in ethnic studies ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class will be a lot of work, in relation to page per a week, intellectually and emotionally, but it is all worth it. Professor Cox is AMAZING. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Because the material and Prof. Cox and imperative to your life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course. Take it for Aimee Cox. Professor Cox is a one of those professors who truly cares about the success and wellbeing of her students. Shes incredibly knowledgable about Black Feminist Theory and is an engaging discussion leader. However, youll only get out of this class what you put in and what your peers put in. That said, the experience in this class would have been better if people were more committed to doing the readings (myself included). ",
            "\u00a0If you are interesting in thinking about the way that identity has been used as a historical/contemporary marker of inclusion and exclusion, ESPECIALLY through the lens of black women and the field of Black Feminist Theory, or you are interested at all in diving into a unique worldview, I highly recommend this course. Every student in the course wanted to be there, which produced a very stimulating environment, and if Black Feminist Theory (and reading it with difficult articles, novels, and music videos) gets you excited, you should absolutely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if unfamiliar with Black feminist theory. Professor Cox will meet you where you are at AND challenge you, which isn't easy. She will encourage you to use the skill sets you already know & push yourself beyond that, as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a course that you get much more out of than the work you have to put in! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Would recommend any and every course with Prof. Cox ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE!!! TAKE IT!!! TAKE IT!!! I almost didn't take it and it honestly scares me how close I got to not taking it. Aimee Cox is a literal goddess. Actually. She is the most intelligent, kind, thoughtful, welcoming, and amazing person there is. Just being in her presence is enough to take this class. But the syllabus is also phenomenal, I learned so much about things I knew nothing about. BFT should honestly be a required course for all undergrads. Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Changed my life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend any class taught by Aimee Cox. She helped me think in new ways and was a generous classroom leader. She brought amazing information to the seminar and always encouraged everyone to ask questions and contribute thoughtfully "
