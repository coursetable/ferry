            "\u00a0Built off key concepts in 117, but very little was new ",

            "\u00a0I developed upon the same skills that I had acquired in ECON 117. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a mix of different econometric approaches. There is a deeper dive into the mathematical proofs underlying some key assumptions we make in statistics and econometrics, then we move on to various more advanced econometric methods. We looked at Randomized Control Trials, Discontinuity-based analyses, among others.\r\n\r\nThere was also a fair amount of R coding, but not a whole lot. ",
            "\u00a0A very useful course--you learn so much about econometrics. A good review of 117 and building from that material. ",
            "\u00a0It bas basically a repeat of ECON 117 but less coherently taught and with an added layer of complication. ",

            "\u00a0I got a fuller understanding of various econometric topics and techniques. I also received a better context of how and when these techniques are used through numerous case studies and examples. ",
            "\u00a0Continuation of Econ 117, more theoritical aspects and differnet methods of a statistical anaylsis. ",
            "\u00a0More advanced econometrics -- so more theoretical probability for econometrics, methods for research. Additionally, we learned more about the different areas of research in economics and practiced R-coding. ",

            "\u00a0I learned the intuition and theoretical framework underlying econometric techniques such as difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity. A lot of the material was covered in 117, but this course goes more in depth into proving the theory. It also introduces a few new topics, such as bootstrapping and heterogeneous effects. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced the mathematic concepts behind much of what is taught in intro econometrics/stats courses. It also taught a few more advanced techniques such as bootstrapping and randomization inference. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course needs to be systemized and have study materials outside of the lecture notes. While the lectures are useful, without accompanying reading and other study material, it is hard to get a grasp of the concepts. Moreover, the problem sets should be more relevant to the exams. The skills relevant to the day-to-day coursework, most of which is done in R, are more or less irrelevant to the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so poorly organized. Lessons were disorganized and hard to follow. The syllabus from the beginning of the semester was so far from what we did all semester. We got through maybe 1/2 of the lessons. Would not recommend this class to be offered or taught again until it is ready to be offered. In its current state, it does not prepare students for anything past econ 117. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: interesting content exposing students to academic literature in Economics and how to do econometrics. Weaknesses: lectures can be hard to follow ",
            "\u00a0At times I felt like the course lacked organization and we had very few problems to practice with for exams. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't the most organized course, on multiple levels. The focus of the course jumped around a lot, and I didn't feel like there was much of a coherent approach or theme. On a more everyday level, Professor Vytlacil wasn't always the most organized or prepared: his slides had sometimes been edited a few minutes before class, he didn't always post things when he said he would/before class, and his lecturing felt quite off the cuff. Obviously he has a young child, and the first two items weren't a huge deal. However, I felt sometime the course could have been clearer had he planned out more clearly the examples he was going to use/how he was going to structure his lectures. Finally, it sometimes felt like we got very lost in the math and technical details of a model, and often I wasn't entirely sure of how what we were studying related to bigger picture ideas. For example, I personally still don't really know why a bootstrap works or why we would use one.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, both he and Vitor (the TF) were very friendly and enthusiastic, and the topics themselves are pretty cool. I loved a lot of the ideas we explored, and including actual economics papers in the later problem sets really made them very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Steep learning curve. A bit disorganized at times. Did not follow syllabus at all; wasn't always clear when we were going to be assigned things. TF and Professor care a lot about the students and want them to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Highly relevant an interesting content, but needs to be much more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I think with time the course will improve. It was clear that this was the first time that 123 had been taught. More regularity in terms of more practice exams before midterms and finals would be great, but it was clear that Vitor and Ed were trying their best. ",
            "\u00a0I think Vitor as a TA was by far the biggest strength of the course. He shored up many of its weaknesses and helped bring much needed clarity to an otherwise less-than-perfectly run course. The examples in class were also helpful in dissecting more\r\ncomplicated subjects. The classs material was never very clear, and lectures were combined and changed frequently. Professor Vytlacil was also not very clear about what material would be tested, which made preparing for exams difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging but labs were more diffucult to follow. Although ever stat class has the problem of balancing R with theory. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly taught class, unclear lecture slides that weren't useful for reviewing, and scattered teaching that made it difficult to follow what was being discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The TA was great! However, the class wasn't very organized and we weren't able to get through a lot of the new topics on the syllabus. It felt like a repeat of Econ 117 with slightly new theoretical material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that you get more exposure to the theoretical elements of econometrics. The slides and labs give wide coverage of material and lectures/TF sessions are engaging. The class would likely be stronger if resources were focused into incorporating an optional research paper (resources could include coding basics for data cleaning in R, sample topics, and advising). As for the labs, I appreciated that the material, solutions, and code were posted simultaneously. However, maybe labs should be reserved for individual self-instruction as opposed to having entire lectures on them. Lectures that focus on new topics and theory were always more interesting than the ones that went over labs. A final problem is the use of linear algebra in showing some theory. While we were never tested on, or expected to understand, the linear algebra in some of the lecture, it still was more distracting than helpful. So getting rid of that stuff where feasible is probably a good idea. ",
            "\u00a0Ed was very sweet and the course was ambitious, but it was very behind syllabus ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in gaining practice in the methods used for economic research. Ed and Vitor were both super nice and very willing to help students. I liked that the psets allowed us to gain experience in working with the data ourselves, and the workload of the course is pretty reasonable; however, that being said, I felt like the psets were not very reflective of the exam material. I also felt like we spent a lot of time reviewing material from 117 that could perhaps have been better spent covering new methods, and the pacing of topics was somewhat uneven, in the sense that we spent a lot of time covering theory at the beginning and were left with very little time to cover several topics at the very end. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers material more in depth than 117, as it should. However, the class is very poorly structured. There doesn't seem to be a logical progression to the things we learn,  and we often went on class-long digressions into topics that fit in in ways not well explained. Furthermore, there's a divide between what we do on psets and what we do on tests, since all the psets are done in R and tests are more conceptual, and there isn't really practice for each. R is never properly taught to us (it wasn't in 117 either) and the the practice material we got for tests turned out to be quite unrepresentative of what the tests ended up being. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in providing a deeper understanding of basic stats/econometrics, but I don't necessarily see it as a more advanced course. The course focused too much on finding applications for particular tools, rather than explaining those tools in a more in-depth way. It was more of a \"how to use econometrics in practice\" course, which included some mathematical justification, than an intermediate course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are hard to follow. I think the class would benefit from more sets of slides that are each shorter - each long one can get unwieldy and it becomes hard to figure out what Prof Vytlacil is trying to impart.\r\nI also would have appreciated having a project instead of exams, as was advertised on CourseTable. I think that the course was primarily in R so having non-R related exams just meant that we had no idea what to expect on tests. "

            "\u00a0no it is so badly organized. you learn nothing new ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that would like to expand their understanding on things that they learnt at ECON117. As this is a new course, it was still rough around the edges and a better structure and additional practice material would help. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend with caveats. The material was good and the professor was fun. However, it was also a bit of a messy course, which some students find particularly frustrating. I had to do a decent amount of learning on my own, and office hours with Vitor (the TF) ended up being where I nailed down a good number of the concepts. Lastly, although this may be obvious, I would only really recommend this if you find Economics or Stats quite exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. There's so much potential in it--to learn a lot, to care about the material--if you go in with that attitude and prepared to put time into the course. Can be daunting, but I got a lot out of it, and I am truly grateful to have taken it and for the professor, TF, and the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it needs time to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would not absolutely not recommend this class to another student. Classes are poorly structured for learning, problem sets rarely correspond with material taught in class, and the exams focus on esoteric topics that were covered only tangentially. Ed is a brilliant researcher and it is clear that he puts his research before his teaching. His lectures were often meandering and impossible to follow and his slides were frequently filled with errors. He has a talent for making simple concepts more complicated than they are. The class is filled with people who LIVE for economics which really doesn't provide for the most healthy learning environment. Please do not take this class it has made my semester terrible ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if Vitor is the TA. He was great. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless youre very passionate about econometrics. Having taken Econ 117 beforehand will definitely help, but it still wasnt a particularly fun or interesting class, especially if not for my TA. ",
            "\u00a0Since it was the first time this ccourse was offered, it was a bit rough to balance the correct depth to teach about econometrics. It will be required for an econ major so not much else to say. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to write a senior paper for the economics major, then you kinda have to take a second semester of metrics. And I liked this course better than introductory econometrics (probably because I had a better base for econometrics material following intro). So yeah, give it a try! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if the syllabus is revamped such that lectures can better keep up with progress ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is worth taking if you are doing it to be able to write a thesis but maybe not if you are just looking for an elective. If you aren't interested in econometrics, the material can definitely be pretty dry, but it was cool to be able to see some of the methods in practice. Although there were not that many assignments, some of them can be intensive, though they are definitely doable. Overall, not the most exciting class, but it is practical. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class. If you are an econ major who is looking for the next step in econometrics, you are better of taking a designated stats course, because that will likely teach the statistics better than in this class, and 123 doesn't really offer much in addition. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone unfamiliar with stats or econometrics, but not for someone with a strong background in either. I think this course could easily be replaced by a combination of ECON 132 and 135 or S&DS 241/242 and 230. I struggle to find a good place for this course in either a stats or an econometrics sequence. ",
            "\u00a0No. I can barely identify anything I learned and felt that I had to teach myself very complicated material. I ended up regurgitating things I had remembered on exams and psets without having a deeper understanding of the concepts. "
