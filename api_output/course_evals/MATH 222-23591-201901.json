            "\u00a0Strengths: Plenty of peer tutors, always someone available to see due to the structure of the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not super heavy on real world applications, review sessions were very weak this past year ",
            "\u00a0This is a good intro class. However, the difference in teaching is obvious between the different instructors. Also, a lot of the last two weeks of the class seemed like an amalgamation of various unconnected topics and they don't make sense in relation to each toher. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - overall solid course for anyone who hasn't taken linear algebra yet. definitely a different way of thinking about math than calc and perhaps a little more applicable\r\nweaknesses - overall the 3 sections didn't seem too unified in what topics they covered per week - our instructor didn't teach for one class and we were one class behind until the very end of the semester\r\n\"linear algebra with applications\" seems deceiving. it should be called \"linear algebra plus half a lecture about its applications\". nothing against the instructors - the applications part was very interesting, but course should probably just be called linear algebra ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was poorly run logistically - there were no answer keys to homework and less feedback for students to improve their skills. Often times it felt like the homework didn't reflect examples in class, and students needed to go to external resources to teach themselves the material. The course lectures also felt like a direct regurgitation of Gilbert Strang's textbook. ",

            "\u00a0No notes or reading were assigned. if you didn't go to class you wouldn't know what happened. we followed the book closely, which was what saved me. Besides the no notes nor readings assigned. No homework solutions were posted either. Never seen a similar class at Yale in a stem field. ",
            "\u00a0There were very few strengths of the class - I guess the homework was fine, but the biggest weakness were the professors. ",

            "\u00a0not that many resources available on Canvas (no problem set solutions, which was especially difficult since problem sets weren't graded in time for the exams), few practice exams. The course was pretty fair though, in the sense that the exam questions weren't completely out of the blue ",
            "\u00a0The material is taught in a logical progression, and the psets are challenging but doable.  I felt like by the end I had a relatively firm grasp on the subject and I feel like I learned genuinely useful knowledge. \r\nAt least for our section, feedback was very hard to get. We weren't given back our midterms, so I have no idea what I got wrong, and psets were just marked with points - there were no comments about where we went wrong. ",
            "\u00a0The only strength to this course was the peer tutors. The teacher did not show much interest in the class and it was structured pretty awfully. The classes were never engaging; when I looked around most people were on their phone. The hw would normally take two weeks to get back and the answers were never released with it so it was difficult to learn from the mistakes. Additionally, we never got back our tests and we only covered some minor applications of linear algebra within the last 30 minutes of the last day. ",
            "\u00a0Content is interesting, could use more real life applications, needs more passionate staff ",

            "\u00a0It needs to be more engaging and more passionately taught ",
            "\u00a0Not enough online resources (practice problems, etc.). Section was pretty meh. Lecture was fine, but it was pretty much an information dump without much engagement. You will most likely be bored to death some classes (but paying attention in class is super important for the homework). A lot of material in this class you might have to teach yourself, so that is a downside. That being said, I never went to peer tutors -- and there seem to be a lot of peer tutor and instructor office hours -- so the resource upside is pretty good I guess. ",

The structure of the courses was really not facilitated to student learning, so be prepared to watch MIT Open Course lectures from Gilbert Strang to teach yourself the material. ",

            "\u00a0The subject of linear algebra is really cool and useful (especially as a gateway for higher level QR classes). The homework is not always so crazy and the class is pretty straightforward with exams. Put in the time and you will do well. That being said, I don't know how 225 compares, but in a vacuum I would recommend 222 if you are a math or econ person. "
