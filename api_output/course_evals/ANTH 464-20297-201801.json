            "\u00a0This course is incredibly interesting and helps to explain why the human body is designed the way that it is. The lab structure helps facilitate learning as hands on work with the bones makes learning all of the features much easier. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent lab-based course. There really isn't anything I would change about it. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class! Learned more osteology than I thought I could take in in a semester. Take it if you can - no regrets, no weaknesses. ",

It would be nice if the course could start with a quiz, rather than an exam, so that students could get a better sense of how to learn this material effectively early on. ",

            "\u00a0absolutely, 100%. one of the best taught classes at Yale, largely through hands-on lab activities guided by our Prof. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Interesting flipped classroom, enjoyable course, fun material and full exposure to real specimens. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and fun and I would definitely recommend taking it if you can get a post. You learn about each of the bones in the body and their important features and muscle attachment sites. The course is fairly low stress and only has two exams and two quizzes, all of which occur before reading week. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Osteology was such a fun, stress-free, and enjoyable class. Every class session is an open lab where you spend time analyzing bone specimens to learn all the features you need to know for the exams and quizzes. There is very little formal instruction except at the start of the semester and a brief lecture at the start of each unit. It is very much a self-driven class where you learn at your own pace. This was such a cool and unique experience, and a really different class from most of Yale's other offerings. "
