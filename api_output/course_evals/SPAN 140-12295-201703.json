            "\u00a0I learned the passive voice in more detail and also learned indirect discourse in Spanish. The rest of the class was about the subjunctive and present/past perfect tenses, which I had learned already in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish speaking and writing abilities, and also expanded my vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my spanish speaking ability. ",

            "\u00a0I strengthened my Spanish skills through reading, writing, and speaking while also learning about different Spanish cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish Grammar ",
            "\u00a0I now feel a lot more comfortable conjugating verbs of different tenses much more easily and quickly. I also learned some new vocabulary but this class more or less reinforced the other lower Spanish classes I've taken at Yale. I wouldn't necessarily describe myself as fluent after taking L2-L4. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, my ability to comprehend spoken and written Spanish improved. I was also able to greatly broaden my vocabulary. My writing became more more fluid, but not necessarily better. My speaking didn't really change. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking abilities improved. ",
            "\u00a0this course has sharpened my command of the Spanish Language ",
            "\u00a0I improved upon reading, writing, and listening skills in this course, as well as practice in partner work and creative presentation skills. ",

            "\u00a0This course was interesting when it involved political arguments, such as the US intervention in Guatemala and other Latin American countries. However, when we got bogged down in grammar it was rather boring. Nonetheless, the class' focus was grammar. I would choose different books to read, as these were somewhat boring. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course is that it is not very interesting. It is a run of the mill Spanish class. ",
            "\u00a0the course was set up so that i had to teach myself everything at home before we went over it in class. it would be much better if we had a lesson in class first and then went home to do the homework. also the supersite online homework was terrible ",
            "\u00a0Having class meetings 5 days out of the week helps reinforce the material we've learned. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to be able to have more ungraded practice. ",
            "\u00a0This course should have a lot more conversation rather than written components because I felt like you could always study a ton to do well on certain written exams (especially since the exact content was given before the exam) but if you have an oral exam then you either can hold a fluent conversation or you can't. I also think that we barely focused on the novel so I would recommend that in order to get the most out of the time in class to either give it more emphasis or scrap it altogether. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot. I think it tries to do too much without the necessary cohesiveness. This makes it feel as if we're just given an incredible number of random assignments. Because of this, I think the class is unnecessarily stressful and unpleasant to take. It was the most troublesome of my courses this semester. That being said, but spanish skills did improve (I think). ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized, but in my opinion the textbook is the most helpful and it is not used quite enough at the end of the semester while reading the novel. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor for this course was extremely patient and detailed in her lessons. However, the class could include more time to practice our conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the courses include its in-depth handling of advanced grammar and organized progression of evaluations.\r\n\r\nSome of its weaknesses include the use of online exercises as the primary homework, as well as using much of class time to review these same exercises. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course to improve my grammar and speaking skills. I wish I had more practice with conversations in Spanish. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is somewhat easy to do well and it is helpful in improving your Spanish if you participate. Make sure you participate to improve your speaking skills!!! ",
            "\u00a0no, i didn't learn anything and did poorly in the class and still had a lot of work ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is a good intensive review of Spanish. The course material is unacceptably expensive. Particularly because the same book must be purchased twice. Once online and once on print. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to be fluent in Spanish this is the next level of it so go ahead but if you weren't fluent in L3 this class probably won't do it for you unless they change it. It's not so much harder than L3 and Profesora Tortora is really good and nice. If you're taking this class to be fluent just go study abroad for a month or two and it'll do you a whole lot more good. ",
            "\u00a0No, but they will probably take it anyway, and it will be fine. Still, it is an intense and stressful class, so I would say no if possible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but be prepared for the course to speed up much faster than L2 or L3 ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, because it balances the amount of review of L3-level grammar and vocabulary with new, more advanced material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good level of Spanish for students to expand their skills. "
