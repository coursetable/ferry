            "\u00a0I thought it was well-taught, and I found it very interesting/easy to engage with. I would only suggest more accuracy to slide examples (there were many typos). ",

            "\u00a0The course material is fascinating and I really enjoyed learning about it. The tests are fair, the labs are pretty clear, and the homework is doable, albeit difficult. The TAs are very helpful and friendly. However, I feel that course is somewhat poorly managed. The class slides sometimes had errors that detracted from understanding, and more difficult concepts were sometimes poorly explained. ",
            "\u00a0It was well-organized and the professor was great, but the labs were extremely difficult and the lab reports were unnecessarily long. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Prof Reed's lectures are awesome. He tells you exactly what you need to make note of, which is extraordinarily helpful.\r\nLabs were engaging and quite enlightening\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lab reports (the ones that weren't worksheets) kinda sucked. I didn't really get much out of them, other than many hours of struggling to generate graphs in MATLAB. ",
            "\u00a0At first the relatively fast pace was a little difficult to keep up with, but Professor Reed was super helpful and agreed to post the lecture notes before class so you could copy down any of the circuits or complicated diagrams before in order to make taking notes easier. If you are a MechE with limited EE knowledge, going to office hours was pretty necessary to successfully complete psets but they were doable. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching, structure, and labs were great. I think the textbook is outdated and not great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good connection between labs and class material, class lectures were straightforward and clear.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the assigned book was very confusing and unclear, often not great connection between what was taught in class and the book material, lecture notes were vague and didnt walk the student through processes. Overall, not much material to rely on outside of lecture itself for studying and understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0The labs could be more engaging and interesting. The in-class quizzes should have been mentioned on the syllabus, or attendance should have been listed as mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this class are the professor, the slides, and the amount of extra help. The weaknesses of this course are the short midterm and final (would rather have a longer midterm and final as if you get a single question wrong on either the midterm or final would greatly affect grade on either of them) and the labs. ",
            "\u00a0The course notes provided by Reed are fantastic, but the lectures are sometimes worthless. He goes too quickly through the material in class. ",
            "\u00a0I was in the first lab group which meant that all of the bugs of the lab would be fixed during our lab and then changed for the next two lab groups. When I would go to start the lab report, I would find that labs had been changed so that I didn't really have the proper data anymore. Not to mention labs were pretty frustrating and long. These bugs should be worked out before any lab groups start the lab! The midterm and final are both in class (only 50 mins long) -- no matter how short the test, this kind of time constraint was really stressful for me. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Reed is a great lecturer. He's engaging and very smart. The pace of the class is completely do-able; it's not too fast, and the lectures prepare you for the psets and exams. However, the labs and lab write-ups were long and I was often unsure of what I had to write about in the lab write-ups. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great overall. ",
            "\u00a0The labs are long a tedious, yet writing out the long \"theory\" sections definitely helped me solidify the material learned in class. \r\nMark Reed is a good lecturer and supplements theory with helpful examples and posts powerpoints online as a great resource. \r\nThe textbook isn't very helpful as the first introduction to the material, but is great for clarification and review. So wouldn't recommend reading it before class, but def look back at relevant sections for psets and exams.\r\nSometimes in lecture prof Reed quickly skims through slides and slides of derivations, which I thought was unnecessarily confusing. \r\nThe final lab appeared disorganised (the lab manual required clarifications, the TAs during office hours weren't exactly aware of what the lab report required and had to catch up themselves on what you were asking about).\r\nMostly, concepts were well explained however the section on transient response wasn't covered as well as the others which made the pset unnecessarily difficult (a group of ~4 students worked for multiple hours to solve 2 problems due to lack of understanding). \r\nWhile the theory was clear, it could be helpful to link the material more often to its real-world importance and significance. This could help with engagement. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really fast paced, so if you don't ask lots of questions in the lecture you can find yourself having to relearn everything on your own by reading the book. The lecture slides could be a bit more organized. ",
            "\u00a0the TFs were a HUGH help in this course- they were alwasy there to answer pset and lab questions. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Reed made many approximations and assumptions without telling us, which makes it very hard to apply what we learned in class to any really circuitry. As an example, to circuits we saw on tests in the course were completely nonphysicalthey would do one thing according to the models we had learned, but because they were being operated under different conditions than those the model was derived under, they would actually do something completely different. We never learned the tools necessary to determine when the equations we were using were right. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is objectively bad. The carelessness of the authors if best exemplified in typos, example exercises that are not worked through (only an unhelpful answer is given), and the way that entire equations are written on single lines in a very unclear and confusing manner. Even the examples that are worked out in the book tend to be unclear in their explanations, skip vital steps, and terrible reflections of the material that is supposed to be showcased. This textbook made learning the course unnecessarily more difficult for people like me who have little to no previous experience with it. Seeing as how it is a textbook from the 90's, hopefully a clearer and more up to date textbook can be used in the future for the sake of the students like me. I get it. This is an introductory class and they tend to be terrible, but this class doesn't have to be as painful as it is if there were a better textbook.\r\n\r\nWhile the textbook was terrible, the class notes were not of much use. The best way to describe them is \"bare-bones.\" In class, Professor Reed can utilize them to explain topics decently but by themselves, they do not serve as a valuable resource for students. ",
            "\u00a0the lectures weren't very helpful since Professor Reed doesn't really walk through the examples step by step, so we didn't really understand the fundamentals for awhile ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are closely connected with labs, which helps ground the lectures in real-world experience.\r\nThat being said, the lectures can also be confusing or excessively fast-paced, and the textbook does little to help in understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0some TAs weren't that knowledgable ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized with later concepts building on earlier ones. The combination of problem sets, quizzes, labs, and exams for grading avoids putting too much weight on any one component (though more quizzes, to avoid a lot of weight on one pop-quiz, would be a further improvement). The support provided in this class between Prof. Reed and the TA and peer tutor office hours is very helpful. In my opinion, the main area for improvement is in the lectures: Prof. Reed's fast-paced PowerPoint presentations often left me somewhat confused, though the availability of complete lecture slides was quite useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Reasonable workload; Fair exams with allowed reference sheets; Lecture slides posted online; The worksheet-type labs were educational and not difficult; My lab TA was helpful; Access to the DUS of Electrical Engineering; I've heard Prof. Reed was flexible with deadlines.\r\nWeaknesses: Pop quizzes (though they were effective at incentivizing attendance); Typos in the lecture slides; Lectures felt a bit rushed; Full labs were difficult to write up. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very fast.  I had a hard time with the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that it is well organized the weaknesses are the psets ",
            "\u00a0Many MANY times I went to the TAs or peer tutor for homework help and they gave me help that was WRONG. That's unacceptable. ",
            "\u00a0Class materials and the class textbook seemed to be the only materials we could rely on for information, as online help and such all varied greatly. The class was great in teaching very useful circuit basics. Many concepts were introduced with their overarching significance, some interesting and historical facts, and the general ideas of how the concepts work, making it very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really hard to follow for me, too fast.. maybe it would help to pause at points and ask a question to make sure people are following. The TAs were great but there were some homework assignments where it seemed like they were lost too, or some of them disagreed, or it was just a struggle to get concrete help, so maybe it would help to give them the homework solutions so that they can be more sure when helping students. The labs were cool and helpful, and Professor Reed is a really straightforward and nice person. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, even for those who do not intend to study in the STEM space.  It is knowledge that I believe everyone should know the basics, and I think that everyone could engage with and grasp the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to understand basic circuitry and how to use things like breadboards. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would recommend the class. The material is very interesting and engaging and Professor Reed is a decent professor. The tests are fair and pretty short. However, this is not a class you should be taking if you are looking for a gut class. The concepts are often difficult to grasp and the homework problems can be challenging even with the help of TAs. Chances are if you are taking this class, it's a requirement for something. If you do take the class, be prepared for teaching yourself. ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this to any student interested in electrical engineering. I wish I had taken this class sooner, it really makes me want to go into electrical engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course isn't particularly wonderful, but it was fair, well put together, and Prof. Reed is a good lecturer. I would say only take it if it's a major requirement or you are really interested in circuit work, other wise, the class won't expand your world view or anything! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in learning about circuits, how they function, how circuit elements interact, and how interesting circuit behavior can be harnessed for human use. Professor Reed is a really good lecturer. He's energetic and is good at answering student questions. The pace of the class is steady and prepares you well for psets and assessments. The labs can be long though, and I was often confused about what I should write for the lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good class to take even if you're not majoring in ME or EE. You'll learn valuable skills about circuits and electronics especially during the lab time. Professor Reed's style of teaching also will make you want to learn more and love electronics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Mark Reed gives a good introduction of the field of Electronics, and even if you are not in the major it will give you a solid base to discuss basic Electronics with anyone. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to leave this course with a good understanding of the material I would highly recommend supplementing the required lab (which I didn't get all that much out of) with a few hours messing around in the CEID over the semester. Designing a transistor amplifier for yourself is very different than analyzing a design that is given to you, and can make things 'click' much more permanently. ",

            "\u00a0It's a requirement for many Eng majors, but if you are considering taking it out of interest, it can provide some good background for further exploration in electronics.  There is not a huge amount of work, and so it can serve as a good elective. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Most students in this class take it because it's required for their major, but I would also recommend it for anyone who enjoys physics-style problem solving and real-world applications of engineering. Prof. Reed is a thorough teacher and very supportive when you go to him for help, though his fast-paced PowerPoints left me slightly lost at the end of each lecture.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets weren't too work-intensive, particularly with office hours (be sure to find a time with a good TA or peer tutor) and study groups. Labs were quite enjoyable, at least for me, with experimental errors that were significant enough to be interesting yet still explainable based on concepts we could understand. Lab reports were sometimes long but were flexible in format, so they rarely felt tedious and helped solidify the course content. ",
