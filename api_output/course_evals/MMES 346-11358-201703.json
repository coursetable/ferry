            "\u00a0Making of the Modern Middle East was such a fantastic eye-opener for me, who had never taken a MMES class and who had only heard middle east topics from American news sources. It was fantastic. Professor Bsheer is a wonderful lecturer and inspiring professor. She is passionate and knows her history and its current relevance. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of important events and phenomena in Middle Eastern history and an incredibly important framework through which to critically analyze both history and current events in the Middle East. I now I feel that, above all, I know how to think about the Middle East, and can critically analyze the myriad, overwhelmingly incorrect ways the West views the region. I am so grateful to have taken this class early in my time at Yale; I feel that, from now, on I will be able to unpack the many false, conventional narratives proffered to us about the Middle East by academia and popular discourse alike. ",

            "\u00a0This class gave a great comprehensive overview of a very dense part of Middle Eastern history. I learned the content, but also how to engage with it and about the politics of the way we learn about the Middle East. We learned about the foundations of false narrative and how we combat this with the knowledge that we had about the region and its history. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really good survey class for the modern Middle East, so I gained a lot of basic information about the history and politics of the region. I think that I can understand contemporary politics and issues in the region better now. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of the history of the region since the early 19th century, but most importantly a better understanding of how to study the region with a nuanced perspective and to shy away from orientalism. Perspective was absolutely the biggest gain from this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a broad overview of Middle Eastern History, starting in about 1500 but really focusing on 1800-present. It's a history class but focused on looking at what brought about the modern state of the region. I learned how to take lecture notes effectively (focusing on what was important), do readings thoroughly and write good reading responses, and have good discussions in section. ",

            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount in this class. I feel like I finally have an understanding of the history of the modern Middle East. I also learned to think critically about how I think about the Middle East, and improved my historical writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic survey course for anyone who wants to learn more about the Middle East. It is impossible to understand what is happening these days in the region without understanding the context behind it and this course strikes the perfect balance - it provides students with the basic understanding of the countries in the Arab world. It is also taught by a great professor - highly recommended! ",
            "\u00a0This was my first college history class, so it was very beneficial for me to further develop skills of historical/critical analysis ",

            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history of the Middle Eastern region. I learned about individual countries within the region, and the changing political and social structures of the region over time, as well as the power of outside influences in the Middle East. The course helped to synthesize and supplement my historical knowledge of the interactions between countries over time. ",

            "\u00a0This course provided me with a basic understanding of the history of the modern Middle East and of different historiographical accounts of historical phenomena regarding that region of the world. This course provided me with a greater respect for historiography and the different ways in which history is relayed. This course also provided me with working knowledge of such historical themes such as colonialism and the nation state. I plan to apply information from this course on state formation and national identity to other history courses in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of multiple major transitions in the middle east, stemming from imperialism, world war II, the discovery of oil, and more. I get the feeling that everyone walked away from this class with a more acute sense of Middle Eastern scholarship, the pervasive biases when documenting and writing about the region, and the progression of events and trends of government crucial to the development of middle eastern countries.

            "\u00a0Strengths would include Professor Bsheer's lecturing abilities, as well as the sections led by a fantastic TA. The readings were also incredibly useful. A weakness that I would point out is the slides- sometimes I wish they had more information that I could use to go back and review lectures or clarify any terms. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a great survey of Middle Eastern history. While it can be frustrating that the scope of the course is simply too broad to gain an intimate understanding of every topic covered, I found the true gift of the class to be far more important than knowledge of any one event or phenomenon. Above all, the course provides an invaluable framework through which to view and understand the Middle East, both past and present. I was especially appreciative of the course's incredibly - and deservedly - critical take on US policy in the region. Such was quite a breathe of fresh air from the the American education system in which I was been raised. The time constraint on the midterm was a bit unnecessary and unrealistic; Professor Bsheer certainly expects a lot. The readings are also quite copious but usually very interesting. Make sure to at least read the Gelvin as it is the basis of the class! ",
            "\u00a0Great course! It's very well-structured and well-chosen considering its vast scope. However, the midterm was during class (50 minutes) which was very little time for 2 essays and 9 IDs. The fact that no one could write that much meant that it was easy/easily graded but not super useful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are incredible. Bsheer puts so much into such a short time, but honestly it never feels rushed. I will say there was quite a lot of dense reading. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had focused on the post-ottoman period more than the ottoman period. ",
            "\u00a0I thought HIST 344 was a perfectly fine course, although the first part moved quite slowly, and I do wish that more time could have spent on the more interesting second half. I think that this was because the earlier part was focused on very, very broad themes (What is modernity? What is colonialism? etc.) and didn't have any of the details/primary sources/close engagement that I like about studying history. Lectures also often didn't go beyond what was said in the Gelvin textbook, and I personally felt that I would have gotten MUCH more out of the class if Bsheer's lectures had not so closely followed that book - I feel that the best lectures give you things that you couldn't get out of a textbook. Some topics that we didn't cover and I wish we had are Ba'athism in Syria and Iraq, the background to the civil war in Syria, the Algerian independence movement, and anything in Oman, Yemen, Sudan, Libya, or Morocco. ",
            "\u00a0This course material was extremely intriguing throughout the semester. I just believe that the form of assessment in this class could be changed a bit. Rather than having \"one shot\" assignments like the midterm and final, I believe this class could benefit from having occasional quizzes to 1) keep students accountable and 2) assure students that they are understanding the material correctly. Other than that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed this class even as a STEM major taking it as a humanities credit. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bsheer is a major strength because she keeps the material very interesting and makes lecture enjoyable. The midterm is challenging. There were definitely times where I felt at a disadvantage not having taken a history class about the Middle East before, but it just meant I had to put in some extra work and ask questions. It would be helpful if Professor Bsheer and the TA's made sure to give a little more background in the beginning of class to accommodate people who have not studied the Middle East before. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bsheer is excellent and the readings are very interesting if you apply yourself. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were phenomenal and great supplements to lectures. Professor Bsheer was also phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well structured. It would have been easy for it to get out of hand, given the breadth of the material, but I think Prof Bsheer did a good job of organizing the subject matter. This class had a reasonable amount of work, although sometimes the reading was a bit much. The TAs were really great and helpful - I think they really cared about the students and put a lot of thought into their work. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class was that the professor often assumed a lot of prior knowledge, especially relating to European history, which I did not have. Additionally, the powerpoint presentations were not super useful; it would have been great if they had more detail, especially with regard to people/ dates (mostly because some of the people had difficult names). ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Bsheer is definitely the course's greatest strength. She commands a level of respect that verges on legendary, and presents the material in a way that allows for individual student engagement despite the class being a mid-sized lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Bsheer is an excellent lecturer, manages to craft narratives out of content that isn't always interesting or easy to follow. The class will probably have a huge impact on how you view the Middle EastI felt like I came out of every lecture thinking differently. \r\nWeaknesses: The middle of the course is not always well-organized (mostly the 19th century)it felt like some things were repeated several times and I couldn't tell the point of a few of the lectures. Also, Professor Bsheer often aims to push back or critique traditional or commonplace narratives about the Middle East, but the syllabus doesn't include many examples of those narratives (and the narratives are often more academic than popular) so it can be confusing at times. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Bsheer is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. She takes the course material very, very seriously, but she's also quite approachable and has a dry sense of humor that makes lectures very enjoyable. I found learning from her to be an incredibly edifying experience.\r\n\r\nThis class does have a great deal of readings, and your work will be evaluated critically. It is most definitely not a gut lecture, and is arguably the toughest History lecture I've taken at Yale. This isn't a weakness, per se  I don't really think the class has any  but students should be prepared for a good deal of work. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was great. It is hard to cover such a large time and area, but Professor Bsheer does this well and hits all the important points. She is a wonderful lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fascinating course! It only has plenty of reading - about 200 pages per week - but all well chosen and informative pieces. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by separating the information based on countries and chronological order rather than by theme. As an introductory course, I find it very challenging (especially for someone with no background knowledge).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presentations and lectures were very helpful in creating a more narrative-like understanding of the events. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, The course is very well structured, classes and sections being complimentary and well organized. The only criticism I can think of is that lecture sometimes feels like it follows one particular reading (Gelvin) quite closely, which makes sense as this is the seminal text used for this course, but at times I felt like lecture could have been an opportunity to expand on the week's readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very interesting--would have like to have lecture outlines before class.  Discussion sections were useful.  Sometimes the readings were a lot but usually very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a large span of time, but did so in detail that was understandable, and progressed in a fashion that made it digestible for students who had no background in the region. The course does move quite quickly at times in order to cover the amount of time and space that Professor Bsheer wants to, which can make it a bit difficult to take in. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture needs to b not content focused instead of thematic ",
            "\u00a0The class is very good at presenting arguments. However, after the midterm the chronology of the events in the course get harder to follow, and it's less driven by timeline than by theme. This is very different form the beginning of the course so it's a bit jarring. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course were strong, and the sections were well done as well. However, I found that Prof. Bsheer consistently assigned well over 100 pages of reading a week, which made it really difficult to keep up with the course. Pruning the reading list would really help everyone's engagement in section and would discourage taking the class Cr/D/F. I also thought Prof. Bsheer's PowerPoints could use improvement, many times they were black and white with just text and didn't really help me organize my notes or learn the material better. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting content but lacked diversity of perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with important information on the Middle East that I've found myself applying to different areas of my life, from courses at Yale to dinner table conversations. I've learned a great deal throughout the term and studying under Professor Bsheer's instruction was a true privilege. \r\nI do, however, feel as though the course was stuck between two genres of courses: a history survey and a historiography seminar. While some of the class focussed on providing the class with an understanding of the specific historical events and mechanisms that have shaped the Middle East, much of the lecture was dedicated to interrogating complex historiographical arguments that attempted to reinvent the study of the Middle East. In lecture, and in course readings, the split felt like 2/3rds of the course was spent on historiography while 1/3rd was focussed on actual facts and issues of cause and effect. As someone who entered the class knowing nothing about the study of the Middle East, I was really looking for a straightforward survey that would supply me with general information on Middle Eastern history. That is to say, information on who ruled where and implemented what policies which lead to xyz, et cetera. However, much of the course got caught up in complex historiographical discussions on how history is written and discussed. Issues of who writes history and how is history told. These questions are critical to a basic understanding of the Middle East, as events in the Middle Eastern history are tied to complex events and orientalist influence. However, I didn't get the most out of these complex historiographies as I simply wasn't well enough equipped with basic knowledge on the Middle East. I wish this course either A. focussed in more in facts and figures and spent slightly less time on historiographical arguments, perhaps making the split 2/3rd basic facts and 1/3rd historiography instead of the other way around or B. turn the entire class into a course that requires some prerequisite knowledge of Middle East history and really dig into the historiography. \r\nAlso, I would consider slightly different methods of examination. Professor Bsheer always dives into the nuances of the history we discuss. However, the format of exams felt incompatible with the level of nuance pursued in the course. The midterm, for example, required students to write essays in 50 minutes on topics that warranted far more time. Similarly, the final take-home exams had page limits of 5 pages per question. The writing prompts for the final exams, like those from the midterm, required far more than 5 pages for discussion, in my opinion. I understand Professor Bsheer's interest in concision. However, I believe that the space and time allowed for full discussion of the prompts were so limited that my writing turned from concise to simply painting complex issues in broad strokes. I couldn't dive into nuance.\r\nFinally, the Gelvin book wasn't in the same addition as on the syllabus. This made navigating assignments very difficult at times. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the only thing is that more time to flesh out the topics would have been great, but as a survey course, I know that isn't possible. After the in-class midterm, it seemed like the structure of lectures wasn't as organized as the first half, however, and continuing the structure of having bullet points and topic sentences in powerportins like in the beginning and the end would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting content that is generally well-structured and organized. But there is TOO MUCH information - every lecture is an overload of information, the number and length of readings is unrealistic for an intro lecture course, and the weekly section responses add to the unfeasible course requirements. To get the most out of the course, you have to put in a ton of time and effort, which may not necessarily be worth it considering that it's supposedly an intro lecture... "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course-you will learn the history of the Middle East but also so many intricacies from truly a very knowledgable source  (Professor Bsheer). I would recommend to do the readings! They are very helpful. Absolutely do not miss lecture as well, that was the best part. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone should be required to take this course. If you are looking for an overview of only the present-day situation in the Middle East, this class is certainly not for you - the first half of the semester is spent on the Ottoman Empire, while the second half barely makes it to the Arab Uprisings of 2011. If you are looking to understand the fundamental dynamics of the region and the historical antecedents of modern phenomena - a pursuit Professor Bsheer has taught me is far more valuable than any run-of-the-mill, ahistorical analysis of current events - then you will not be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely the most challenging survey history course I've taken. Not only was the material hard for me to conceptualize, but the reading each week was much more than other survey courses. The trade-off being that besides an in-class midterm, take-home final, and weekly Canvas discussion posts (which I'm pretty sure weren't graded), there wasn't a whole lot of work required of this course. If you do take it, and the structure is similar, know that you don't really need outside readings for the midterm, but you do for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because Professor Bsheer's lectures on Israel/Palestine and oil companies are fascinating. Also the whole idea of the course to not look at the middle east from an orientalist lens is refreshing. It can be a punishing amount of reading though. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I came in knowing nothing about the Middle East and now I can look at the news with a basic grasp of its history. If you do not have the time to take this course, read Gelvin's \"The Modern Middle East\" - it's easy to read and is basically this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, students need to learn more about this region. It's so important! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want a good and broad understanding of the making of the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who have not taken a history course outside of Europe/America, or to those who have never taken history. I do feel that a lot of the class was spent dealing with very broad themes that come up in all other history classes (modernity, nationalism, colonialism, imperialism, orientalism, don't be racist) and not dealing with the specifics of what happened in Middle Eastern history, at least until the latter part of the course when we did deal with some topics in detail. For people very interested in this topic, and who love delving into the details of history, working with primary sources, and reading interesting papers, I would probably recommend a different course, but for those looking for a very broad overview of things you might get to study in a history class outside of Europe or America, I think that this is a good choice. Do be aware that many of the lectures are straight out of the Gelvin textbook, which I personally found to be quite disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend History 344 to another student. While I had come into the class with some preconceived notions about the Middle East, the thorough background story provided by this class really gives a comprehensive idea about how this region developed. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in history. It is so important to have an understanding of the history of the Middle East, especially given the era we live in. Professor Bsheer is excellent and you will be challenged and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I took I.T as a credit/d and I.T was a solid choice in that regard. If you choose to take I.T for a grade just be sure you know how much reading is required and if you havent taken a middle eastern history course before I.T can be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I would and already have recommended this course. I think the material is imperative for everyone to engage with and it truly changed my outlook and understanding of the Middle East. It allowed me the knowledge I needed to form opinions for myself rather that listening to popular media that doesn't always carry a true narrative. ",
            "\u00a0The Making of the Modern Middle East was an all-around great class. Professor Bsheer is truly wonderful, and she makes the material easily understandable and really interesting. This class covers Middle Eastern history from around the 17th century to the present day, so there is a ridiculous amount of material to cover. Prof Bsheer thus had to use a lot of generalizations and frameworks to get through all the material (mostly based on the Gelvin textbook). But I think I still got a good understanding of the individual regions and nations that we studied. There was definitely more emphasis on countries like Egypt and Iran, as compared to places like Lebanon or Bahrain. The course was well structured, and the readings supplemented the lectures well (there was a LOT of reading though). Professor Bsheer is really cool and put a lot of work into this class. \r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for a good survey class of the Middle East. I feel like I can have reasonably informed conversations about the region now. Lastly, I think this is an important class to take; it dispels many of the myths about the Middle East, especially in this era of Islamaphobia and xenophobia. This class puts the West in conversation with the Middle East, in a way that reveals their intertwined history, and shows that you cannot understand the current situation, without understanding the role of imperialism and American meddling/ interests. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you're looking for a fantastic survey of the modern history of the region we've come to call the Middle East, or just want to take a course with Bsheer. I took this course Cr/D so didn't end up doing all of the assigned readings, however the reading load can be quite hefty and is fairly consistent. Readings definitely form the bulk of section discussions, so if you're taking this class for a grade and hoping for a strong mark I highly suggest planning out your schedule accordingly. Overall, a fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyonehistory majors, humanities students, or anyone looking for an interesting humanities credit and willing to put in some work. You get out of this class what you put inthe readings are so interesting, so do them well! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course.\r\n\r\nProf. Bsheer is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. She takes the course material very, very seriously, but she's also quite approachable and has a dry sense of humor that makes lectures very enjoyable. I found learning from her to be an incredibly edifying experience.\r\n\r\nThis class does have a great deal of readings, and your work will be evaluated critically. It is most definitely not a gut lecture, and is arguably the toughest History lecture I've taken at Yale. This isn't a weakness, per se  I don't really think the class has any  but students should be prepared for a good deal of work. ",
            "\u00a0Good content-- the history of the Middle East is fascinating (and often studied wrong as you learn in the class) and most of the readings are really well chosen although sometimes too long. However, lectures could be a bit dull and in the beginning even regurgitations of the reading. Final is a \"take home exam\" -- essentially two papers-- which is a bit cheeky. The TAs are great, really helpful with review and Professor Bsheer is still badass. Overall the class isn't as fantastic as some people claim, so take this class if you're really interested in learning history of the Middle East and definitely attend at least a few lectures if you don't end up taking. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great for me because I knew virtually nothing about the history of the Middle East, but it was very accessible and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the history of the Middle East and of how we think about and learn about the Middle East now. I was mind blown by a lot of the ways that studying the Middle East has actually shaped the history itself, and I think that it is an eye-opening course for anyone in any major. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about what is happening in the Middle East then I would definitely take this course. The Arab Spring is as a result of ingrained issues which have been swept under the carpet and this course will expose those realities. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides a pretty great overview of Middle Eastern history, and of the problems in historiography of the region. Professor Bsheer's lectures are always interesting and insightful, and she's always willing to answer questions. The reading load isn't ridiculous, and the midterm was definitely a bit long for the time given, but not impossible. My section was also run extremely well, and I learned a lot from it (If Ellen Nye is TFing again next time, she's incredible). Overall, it's just a really great course. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course about Middle Eastern history. As a person of Middle Eastern descent, I had some prior knowledge going into this course, but it was quite in-depth and I learned a ton. I was thankful for the chance to get to learn history that is important for any person who wants to understand today's socio-politics to know. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Understanding some of the major trends and developments of the Middle East is essential no matter what major/career you may want to pursue. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend as an intro course on the Middle East.  The more readings you do the more you'll get out of class and lectures are great so I would recommend going to them.  You really don't need to have any background in history before this course--it's a great gateway to history of the Middle East! ",
            "\u00a0Making of the Modern Middle East provides a detailed background on the history of the Middle East. It is extremely helpful in understanding how the region has developed over time, and why the tensions that exist there today came to be. The course features detailed studies of a number of relevant subjects, including nationalism and oil. It does cover a lot of history, and can be a bit of a challenge to keep up with at times, but the content is absolutely worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone should know this information and get a chance to learn from Rosie. She is a powerful thinker; even if you don't agree with her everyone must at least in engage with her during your time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Making of the Modern Middle East is a good but not great introduction to this period and area. Prof. Bsheer does a good job covering a lot of ground over the course of the semester, but a lot of times the lectures felt unnecessarily revisionist in a way that made them one-dimensional. That said, I learned a lot from the course and it made me appreciate the region's history a lot more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I thought Professor Bsheer brought an interesting and different perspective to studying the Middle East as well as covering the basics needed in this survey. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course and the professor - this was one of my favorite lecture classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure that I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Bsheer is absolutely brilliant but a lot of the ideas discussed in the course feel incompatible with the lecture format. I entered this class expecting to learn about a broad swath of historical events that have shaped the modern Middle East. Instead, Professor Bsheer spent much of the class time on deconstructing the process by which the history of the Middle East has been recorded, relayed, and understood, contrasting orientalist histories with more contemporary histories. In short, she spends more time on historiography than she does on history. This focus on historiography is, of course, important for a fully understanding of the Middle East. However, I felt as though she spent slightly too much time dedicated to historiography and the class felt somewhat lopsided. I would have preferred this class as a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0THIS CLASS IS PHENOMENAL. If you've ever had a vague or a deep desire to know more about Middle Eastern history, take this class. I was on the edge of my seat in lecture just absorbing all of the riveting historical narratives that Professor Bsheer told us. She is an excellent teacher, and your should take this class if only to hear her clear and organized thoughts on middle eastern history. Sections were great, and inspire you to do the readings in order to contribute to discussion. Grading seems a little hard, but this was definitely a class in which I actually learned something I didn't know before, which is why we come to Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, if you are interested in learning about the Middle East. But beware that if you aren't used to the discipline of History, this can be a very dry course where exams are simply regurgitation of information that we have been spoonfed. In other words, apart from the massive loads of information, there isn't that much intellectual challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great introduction to historiography with a focus on a region that is often underrepresented or misrepresented; an extremely passionate professor. "
