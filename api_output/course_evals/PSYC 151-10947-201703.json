            "\u00a0I gained very little in any respect by taking this class. Every lecture felt like the same material and the presentation was more about the professors personal life than the research in the field. ",

            "\u00a0Really interesting learning about EI and the background. ",
            "\u00a0Apart from some basic information about how emotions work, I learned next to nothing in this class. I could have learned more by purchasing a book on emotions and reading a few chapter summaries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different types of emotions and emotion regulation types-- seeing how these were related to each other on a coordinate plane, like emotions from the MoodMeter or Thomas Kilmann conflict resolution types was really informative. It was also really helpful for me to be in a class at Yale that spoke of the value of emotional wellness and regulation strategies that I would often neglect for the sake of other Yale classes. My understanding of emotional intelligence, and how pleasantness and agreeableness are not necessarily accurate reflections of it (EI is so much more internal) taught me a lot about the things that I needed to work on (even while being highly patient, positive and agreeable). ",

            "\u00a0Before this course, I was totally uninformed about emotional intelligence and its importance. I now have a comprehensive knowledge of EI, SEL, and other ways in which emotional intelligence can be taught and understood. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me understand just how important emotions are in our everyday life outcomes. It helped me understand the scientific field of emotional intelligence, that not all emotions are bad, the contexts in which different emotions are useful, strategies for resolving emotionally charged conflict, and how to regulate my emotions and recognize emotions in others. This class also gave me an introduction to the educational field of social and emotional learning which is a very promising and increasingly important aspect that all children should have access to in their classrooms. ",

            "\u00a0Emotional Intelligence is SO IMPORTANT! I did not realize before taking this class just how much of an impact it has on our abilities to learn and succeed. When President Salovey used to mention it in emails it seemed to me almost like a buzzword, something college students should practice like self-care, mindfulness etc.  (not in any way to discount these things they are also important). Emotional Intelligence is a very interesting field and the things that I learned in this class have influenced my life in so many ways outside of the classroom. By changing my habits and focusing on improving my emotional intelligence (being cognizant of my own feelings and being able to identify them, articulate them and use them in a productive way) I had a MUCH better semester than I would have. I truly think that this class played a big role in my personal feelings of success this semester when it comes to mental health, personal growth  and positive relationships. ",
            "\u00a0In this class lectures taught me about different techniques for emotion management and regulation, self-report questionnaires taught me about my own emotional tendencies, and a final paper invited me to explore empirical literature on a self-chosen facet of emotion research. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of emotional science, the psychology behind it, and practical applications of it in the classroom through social and emotional learning. I also gained some insight into myself, my personality, and my emotion states, which was really cool and not necessarily something I was expecting to get from this class. It just made me feel better about myself in general - I struggled a bit academically in some other classes this semester, and I joked with my residential college dean that this class was my therapy to help me get through the hard time I was having in those other classes. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information about emotional intelligence ",

",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about how emotional intelligence is measured, the different components of emotional intelligence such as RULER, and how emotional intelligence is taught in schools via SEL programming. I was introduced to the scholarly work on emotional intelligence, which helped me build a better vocabulary to describe my own feelings. This class also helped me in developing my own emotional intelligence, and gave me a toolkit of helpful strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to personally manage my emotions in a way that is healthy and has caused me to work better and enjoy relationships at a more favorable capacity. ",
            "\u00a0This class really hammered the home the importance of regarding emotional intelligence as a real and urgent field of study. At times, it seemed to explain obvious points about emotion, but seeing it laid out like that really showed how much people nowadays reject their emotions and don't regulate them properly. ",
            "\u00a0Well, I definitely learned a fair amount about emotions and how to teach them, but besides the content of the course I really didn't learn anything in terms of skillsets. ",

            "\u00a0Emotional Intelligence is a really interesting topic, and I think it is such an awesome opportunity that so much of fundamental work was done at Yale. Throughout the semester, I learned what emotional intelligence is, how it can be measured, how can it be developed in adolescents, why it needs to be implemented in schools, and how it can be beneficial to the workplace and school.

While it helped me to understand the basic theory of emotional intelligence, the amount of new, insightful research it illuminated was limited by the newness of the field itself. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The format of the course requires one to read vast quantities of material, much of which is never discussed in class. Then it shows up on an exam. This class ostensibly has a section, and though we occasionally met to fill out surveys, having a more regular section to go over material might actually be helpful, especially if it focused on summarizing the many other studies we were supposed to read. ",

The exams take a long time to get back and you may have no idea how you did on the last one before you have to go about preparing yourself for th next. The exam was misrepresented by the professor in terms of the types of questions that would be on it, and the questions themselves seemed to be more geared towards testing the exact extend to which you memorized which author didnt say which thing than actually testing your grasp of the big picture. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - slowing down lecture, i couldn't keep up with the slides while taking notes\r\n\r\nStrengths - Prof. Brackett always kept us engaged and involved in class ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brackett focused primarily on his own work, only gave a brief overview of the field as a whole ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class material actually improves your life, lectures are easy to understand. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are easy to understand because they are TED talks (so they're kind of hard to study from/it's hard to figure out what will actually be tested on the exam), difficult to understand what you need to learn from the readings (I didn't expect to have to know the names of authors in the readings after the prof said that \"big ideas\" will be tested), lecture slides are posted two days before the exams (so if you need those as a study aid, life kinda sucks), logistical details of the course are told extremely late (that big final paper? you'll only hear about it two weeks before class ends and the prof/TF are hard to get ahold of). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nInteresting subject matter\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNo discussion sections\r\n\r\nPLEASE PLEASE add discussion sections. Some of this material really does merit discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The class seemed unstructured. A large amount of time was spent with Prof. Brackett telling stories about un-emotionally intelligent people, which didn't really teach very much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fairly clear, basic overview of EI and then SEL (specificially RULER)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the course mostly focused on Professor Brackett's own research and tools he'd developed, and barely touched on other SEL programs. Also most of the info discussed felt very superficial and we rarely got into the nitty gritty of the challenges, complications, and weaknesses of the theories/programs discussed. ",
            "\u00a0a little repetitive but strengths are many real life applications and the professor is awesome ",
            "\u00a0Liked how Prof. Brackett included time for us to talk to folks around us about the material, that was fun. Also getting to see how my emotions changed over the course of the semester was awesome as well! ",
            "\u00a0The tests were too focused on readings and things that I felt weren't stressed enough in class. Strength is that professor brackett told a lot of stories to relate information and help you understand it ",
            "\u00a0very interesting material taught in an engaging way ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to take itself seriously. The course is taught in a way that makes it seem as though emotional intelligence is a pseudoscience. The course should also focus far more on emotional intelligence itself instead of the implementation of SEL classes. Very little time at all was spent on the most interesting part of emotional intelligence, which is how we develop and respond to our own emotions. ",
            "\u00a0I think that handing in the small group discussion notes helped increase my accountability in a way that made sure that I went to class (important)! I liked lectures a lot, and found the readings interesting, and the tests fair. I think that the last section on SEAD could be changed a little, or powerpoints could, in general, be improved. I liked the textbook as well. ",
            "\u00a0Great material. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the majority of our readings were relevant papers in the field of emotional intelligence because it helped us understand how grounded in science this field was and the effects that emotions really can have on everyday outcomes. \r\n\r\nI wish we had gotten to see our tests and not just see the posted grades so we could understand what we got wrong. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. I really enjoyed it. The readings for the third exam were a little dense, on the exam I probably wouldn't have asked such specific questions on readings that long but overall I can't really complain. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned about current trends in emotional and social psychology. Most psychology classes seem like a review of the more tradional work in the field, but Professor Brackett made sure students were up-to-date on the cutting edge of emotional regulation research. \r\nWeaknesses: Lots of reading that was interesting but that seemed irrelevant to lectures and was not often addressed until exams. Self-report questionnaires could've been done in class, and sometimes it seemed like there was no structure to the lectures or like the lecture time wasn't being used as effectively as it could be. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a really cool lecture to go to, and (in my opinion, at least) worth getting up at 9AM to attend. He had a couple of off-days, but as a rule the professor was very energetic & ready to get us to engage with the material. We often had to work in little groups to do some reflective exercises or other activities, which was a good or bad thing depending upon my mood that day and how much I felt like interacting with other at such an early time - but generally it made a large lecture feel smaller and more personal. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this class would be that we didn't have discussion section so it felt kind of awkward to me to engage with my TF (I didn't actually know who my TF was until the last few weeks of class, because my original TF from the beginning of the semester disappeared for some reason and I got moved into a different group), so asking questions about the course when they came up was something that I never really did until I had questions about the paper that absolutely needed to be answered. Additionally, we never got to see any our physical exams after they were graded, so I felt like I'd lost the opportunity to learn from my mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that the professor was very knowledgeable about EI and he was a very engaging lecturer. No real weaknesses that I noticed ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't necessary to force students to sign up for a \"lab\" section and sit in a room to complete an online survey. It was very inconvenient and didn't seem to serve any purpose except for collecting data for the professor's research. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course does a decent job in teaching the theories and models of emotional intelligence and how emotional intelligence applies to everyday life. I liked how we often did interactive activities in class with a partner or small group in order to apply some of the things we learn in class. However, I don't think that these interactive activities made students feel like there was much of a purpose to do them, so I think that many students didn't take them seriously or didn't see a point to doing them. I also think that the exams did a poor job in testing the material; most, if not all, of the questions dealt mainly with memorization, either from the readings or from lectures, and I believe that some of the questions on the exams were unfair because they asked for very specific details that only appeared once or twice in readings or lectures. I think that the exams should be changed to have more questions dealing with real-life applications of the material; for example, there could be questions that present a scenario and ask for how we would deal with that scenario in order to align with a particular portion of emotional intelligence theory. Overall, I think the course should be redesigned in a way that would promote more student interest and engagement, and that would involve more applications into everyday life and real situations that every person would encounter. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Brackett is great at making his lectures engaging and meaningful. I always feel like I leave class with a new strategy to help deal with my problems or a new way of thinking about my emotions. The class also encourages you to be reflective and mindful, which is tough to find at a school that moves at such a fast pace. The tests were difficult, but fair.\r\nWeaknesses: It is very difficult to have that class at the 9AM time slot, I always show up very tired and it can be difficult to activate myself for his lecture. That's unfortunate because I don't want to miss out! Maybe in the 11:35-12:50 slot would be better. ",
            "\u00a0The readings should be more discussed in class. Also, theres a lot of information but not all of it is important for the exam. Maybe some delegation or at least letting the students know. ",
            "\u00a0This class was engaging and the lecturer was good at getting the class involved. My one qualm is that there were a lot of weekly readings that did not show up in class at all except for on midterms. Of course, this is an effective way to check if students are doing homework, but it seemed utterly useless in the scope of the class. The things we read were just regurgitated as multiple choice answers on the midterms and rarely elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - very knowledgeable professor,  engaging material, helpful TFs\r\n\r\nweaknesses - weird format, repetitive, and seemed like there wasn't nearly enough sound scientific evidence to back up the claims made in class. also most of what we learned was common sense but then on tests he would make obvious answers difficult by using ultra specific wording and expecting us to remember the exact wording of common sense material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class is extremely entertaining. The weaknesses are that the exams were pretty unpredictable ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely the lectures. Marc's lectures were engaging and informative, with lots of opportunities for interaction and participation. Every lecture involved journaling, talking to a partner, or some kind of role-playing, which really helped me remember everything we learned when it came time for exams.\r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses, it would be nice to hear more about other social-emotional learning interventions that exist. I know RULER is Marc's intellectual baby and arguably the best program out there right now, I felt like we focused so much on RULER and its successes that we didn't talk about other successful (or unsuccessful) programs. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class just needed a little more of \"where can I go from here\". But amazing, amazing class that changes how you look at education and relationships and just life in general. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a very interesting lecture, though I wish we took some time to go over some of the ideas in our readings. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher is great and cares about the students and topic a lot. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is its focus on theory application rather than abstract thought on a new concept. A weakness is simply the heavy lecture-style teaching involved, although this is unavoidable. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I learned quite a bit throughout the first quarter of the semester, but then the lectures became very redundant. The exam questions were also written in a way that was difficult to understand. I was assigned to a TF at the beginning of the semester, but was never informed that she apparently stopped being a TF for the course until later in the semester when I reached out to her for paper help and my emails went unanswered. That seems like something you should notify the students about... that their TF is no longer a part of the class. Would have saved a lot of stress and confusion. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is definitely the way the information is taught. Professor Brackett does a good job of teaching information in layers, as one thing builds on the next. We also were able to measure our own emotional intelligence throughout the semester, which was an engaging part of the class.\r\nA weakness of this class is that a lot of research is still being done in the area of emotional intelligence, and some of the content does get redundant. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-interesting material ",
            "\u00a0The readings might have been the strongest part of the course. Diligently doing the readings really does offer some interesting insight into emotions. The lectures did get a bit tiresome and repetitive, but the topics they covered were important. I was always glad I went. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lectures, I wish we went over some of the reading materials a little bit more. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were directly related to the course material and very interesting. Exams were extremely fair and clearly graded. I think that some of the course material is self-explanatory in that students understand the general importance of emotional intelligence, so I think that if it were supplemented with scientific articles showing the biological dimension of emotional intelligence, which students know less about, that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I find the basic subject of this class to be both intriguing and applicable. Far too many of us forget about skills like self-awareness and emotional expression in our everyday lives. While the premise of the class is exciting, the lectures themselves do not really delve deeply into the scientific research to support all of the techniques and tools discussed. I felt that the class also  could have been more engaging; the exams were primarily based on memorization of slides from the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes interesting, but attending class is often very unneccessary as the instructor mainly just reads from some slides with self-explanatory information on them. Some of the readings were very informative and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0seemed disorganized at times, but subject matter was interesting and lecture was engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that there isn't that much work during the semester, you just have to go to the lectures and then study for the tests. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is very interesting, but with the caveat that you will get the most out of this course if you actually go to lectures and do all the reading. With a big lecture, there is definitely a temptation to skip, but the material covered in lecture is not the same as what is in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0No. I found this course deeply frustrating. I think this course takes steps backwards in terms of convincing people that emotional intelligence is a valuable and legitimate field of study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think every person that goes to college, including professors should have to take this course. It gives so much information and advice about how to teach, listen, act, react, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. The course was much different than I thought it would be, didn't dive into the material that I found the most interesting and instead focused primarily on Professor Brackett's own work ",
            "\u00a0The material will absolutely help your daily life. But the lecture class is way too big, and there is little logistical structure implemented to help such a large crowd with such varying needs. Take this class if you want to Cred/D/F it. If you're like me and just wanted to fulfill a So requirment, there are other courses that are better organized and can give you better, individualized attention. I literally couldn't get clear communication from the prof or my TF because the class was so large. ",
            "\u00a0Do NOT take this course. I know what you are thinking. \"It's about emotional intelligence, how hard can it be?\" \r\n\r\nHard. I did all of the reading and attended every lecture. I studied a LOT for the exams. The exams and assessments are out of the blue. The 15-page paper is awful because you don't really learn anything the whole semester. Try to write 15 pages about something on which you know nothing. It's not easy.\r\n\r\nEven worse, this class is extremely arbitrary. The exams make no sense, and are written by the TF's off of the lecture slides. It's unfortunate because sometimes the lecture slides contradict Professor Brackett and the readings. So if you actually pay attention, you WILL get the answer wrong. Further, have fun reading hundreds of pages of readings about which you will be asked to recall minute and obscure details.\r\n\r\nThere is no section for this course, so if you have questions, good luck. \r\n\r\nIf you want a gut, look elsewhere. This was the most frustrating course of my Yale career. Avoid avoid avoid. Goodbye GPA. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class. It is truly a waste of time. Don't be pulled in by evals that say it's easy and interesting. It's not interesting, and the exams aren't easy. Unfortunately, this course has served to persuade me that Emotional Intelligence is a pseudo-science. We spend all our time talking about why various aspects of emotional intelligence matter, but we really don't learn how it's taught or how to improve our own. My own ability to recognize, understand, label, express, and regulate emotion has not increased. I truly haven't learned anything that I couldn't learn from doing one 5-page reading. You will regret taking this. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is easy in class because just lectures but when the test comes you have to study and put in the extra work and BUY THE TEXTBOOK ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in psych or education studies or emotions in general then you should take this class! It was hard sometimes as a 9 am but if that's ok with you then do it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, If you like psychology I would take it. but keep up with the readings because if not you will be overwhelmed when the test comes ",
            "\u00a0yes because it is interest material with a professor that makes going to class fun ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to anyone. There is no valuable knowledge to be gained from taking it. If you are looking for an easy fifth class, still do not take it. Attendance is taken in class, so you can't just blow off lecture and study for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0The information from Emotional Intelligence is invaluable-- it's often true that students already have some insight into the content of the course. However, there are still many insightful tidbits that have a lot of practical use in everyday life. For those that can afford to take it and care about the emotional wellness of themselves or others, a great course to take! If you are the kind of person who believes that emotions are fixed states or don't believe emotions and their regulation to be in any way nuanced, and know that no one could possibly convince you of the contrary, don't take this class. You will not find it relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend. Interesting material and really easy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this school to any student. Emotional intelligence is a very important concept to understand, and it's very new in the field of psychology. This means that it is important for individuals to understand this concept so they can apply it to their individual and social lives. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you are not a psychology major or an Education Studies scholar I would recommend this course to any Yale student because it will help you be more aware of your emotion and help you better regulate your own emotions which is a critical life skill that you can use anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a way to get an extra credit if you have a tough workload in your other classes. There is not much work and it can easily be added to a schedule without much to worry about. It is interesting and relatively low in terms of workload, so I think it is a good class to add to a tough schedule if you need another credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was very interesting and the things you learn are SO important for your own life. I had a MUCH better semester taking this class than I would have otherwise. I truly think that this class gave me a lot of important skills that helped me to focus on and improve my mental health, my relationships and so many other aspects of my life. I stopped suppressing emotions that I didn't know how to handle because it gave me the skills to understand and express them. If there is at least one course you take at Yale to help you in LIFE I would definitely take this one. Emotional Intelligence is so important and a key to academic and professional success ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend taking this course Credit/D, if you want to take it at all. The exams test you on your memorization of arbitrary studies and readings rather than understanding of key concepts. Overall, an okay course if you are interested, but there are much better courses out there. ",
            "\u00a0Yep! Not a stereotypical psychology course but definitely an interesting way to get exposure to new ideas in the field. Not a class to be too stressed about, but a lot of great ideas and techniques that are relevant to helping students manage their Yale experiences better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was an enjoyable lecture to go to and not too difficult of a class if you attend the lecture and do the readings. (Someone who'd taken the class in a previous semester told me that I didn't have to do the readings to do well on the exams. That was a lie. If you want an A, do the readings.) I'd recommend it specifically to first years - it's a good class to be taking as you adjust to Yale, and it gives you an interesting opportunity to reflect on how you've developed over the course of your first semester. Not to say it's not just as beneficial to students in later years - everyone takes away from it what they put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course if you're looking for a relatively easy, interesting psych course. However, it's not as big of a gut as some people say it is, but as long as you do the readings you should be fine for the exams ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. I don't think that the course is designed in a way that really promotes the understanding and application of the material being presented in the course. This course doesn't facilitate productive learning of all of the material, which is disappointing because I think that the material we cover in class is very helpful and applicable in everyday life. If this course was redesigned in order to really promote the understanding of the material and the application of the material to real-life situations that we would all encounter, then I may reconsider recommending this course to other students. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good course but it had periods that were very uninteresting. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to take if you have the time. It really helps you put things in perspective and gives you skills that will last your whole life. ",
            "\u00a0EI is a great class minus the fact that it was taught at 9AM and you had to basically talk about your feelings the entire semester (LOL - which I probably wouldn't have minded as much if the class wasn't right at 9AM). Regardless of that, I learned a lot about EI and how EI training is being implemented around the world. Try to read the outside readings because they will bite you in the butt on the test, if you didn't do them. Brackett is funny and fun to listen to, so it is easy to engage in the class. Also, you usually have to turn in a sheet of paper everyday saying that you were there, so if you don't like going to class, you will get docked on your final grade. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I think if you take this class seriously it can really help you become aware of your emotions. I referred back to the things I learned in this class many times throughout my semester and it really opened my eyes to a different way of approaching situations and trying to regulate my emotions. ",
            "\u00a0sorry,  I would not recommend. as much as it is a privilege to learn from Marc Brackett, his class is disorganized and based on pseudo scientific research and the tests are incredibly unreasonable. The workload is too much especially for a class that has such easy and digestible concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Although it is always a huge lecture, Professor Brackett does a lot to make it feel more personal. In every class there were opportunities to journal for a few minutes or talk to people around you, which made the lectures engaging. \r\n\r\nThe workload is pretty minimal but you do have to take the material seriously to succeed. On each of the three exams, about half of the material is taken directly from the reading so you have to do it at some point. Attendance is taken at almost every lecture by submitting a 1-minute written response to some question, so you should go to lecture to avoid getting docked a few points in participation.\r\n\r\nThis class gave me a lot of helpful tools to help both myself and others understand and express emotions thoughtfully! ",
            "\u00a0LOVED THIS CLASS. Emotions do matter and I thought this class was so important it should be required for all Yalies. Pretty low workload and if you really open yourself up to learning about emotions and why they matter, this class might just change your perspective on life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's an interesting class ",
            "\u00a0I think it's an interesting class to take, though I wish I had paid a bit more attention. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely a great class on interesting subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend. It's interesting and applicable ",
            "\u00a0No. Awful class. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly, especially if they are curious in the social sciences/child development areas - not necessarily psychology. ",
            "\u00a0The majority of the lectures are interesting. If you don't mind a lecturer who cold calls ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is very interesting and I think everyone should take it during their time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very useful for all areas of life. ",
            "\u00a0If nothing serious or traumatic has ever happens to you then take it. Personally, when Brackett lead exercises which asked us to relive every detail of difficult situations, it really affected me and put me in a terrible and sad mood for the rest of the day. Im not even an emotional or expressive person but I cried in a couple of them. The content isnt helpful really either. Its cool to learn why we have certain emotion states, but there are no helpful regulation strategies. He presents some, theyre just not useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably recommend this course. I definitely went back and forth throughout the semester, but I think it is good for Yale students to spend a bit of time each week thinking about their emotions (and emotions in general). ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course and I think everyone should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Emotional Intelligence is the kind of course where you get what you put into it. If you work hard in studying for the tests, you will do well. If you are engaged during lecture and try to apply the concepts in your everyday life, you will see their benefit. ",
            "\u00a0If you pay attention and care about the subject matter, this is an interesting course with a manageable workload. Professor Brackett is funny and relatively easygoing. Participation is appreciated and it has a lot of opportunities to both be fun and build insight. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any Yale student. First of all, the study of emotional intelligence is unique to Yale (especially since Salovey helped to develop the original concept), so students should take advantage of the opportunity to learn more about it. It is also very relevant to everyday life; no matter what you're majoring in, you could probably benefit from knowing more about how to recognize, understand, label, express, and regulate emotions. The exams were all reasonable (especially if you keep up with the readings and lecture notes) and the workload was light overall. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. I felt like I was wasting my time and didnt learn a ton in class. ",
            "\u00a0yea fam take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would say take it. It's pretty easy and interesting. "
