            "\u00a0Some sessions were stronger than others. Since most were guest lectures, it was usual for the lecturer to talk for 45-50 minutes, leaving little time for the students to give their presentations and little time for discussions with the class. While the invited lecturer is undoubtedly an expert in their field, the lack of discussion time available is a problem and should be corrected. ",

            "\u00a0One thing I did not appreciate about the course was changing the final presentation schedule one week in advance. I understand the reasons behind it but given that I am an APMPH student whose clinical time/family time gets planned weeks in advance, it is hard to make last minute adjustments.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I think some topics can be cut out from the course (lead session for instance) to allow time for global health to occur on two separate weeks, with perhaps different guests rather than a 4 hour extravaganza. \r\n\r\nThe time for presentations and perhaps number of presentations can be dramatically changed without the course suffering. While most of the articles were pertinent, I think reading one less and presenting one less would still have allowed for good discussion to happen. In fact, I argue that having time for discussion that was not rushed would have improved the course significantly. ",

Although the topics were interesting, most of them were overlapping with the other courses' topics that I took this semester. I cannot say that I've learned much. I liked the guest lecturers though. The Grand Challenge proposal was stressful but also was joyful. But I wish it was more clear in terms of the steps that we need to follow. Main problem of this class was nothing was clear until the very last minute. We were expected to present to two presentations for example, but it turned out that nobody knows it because we were not informed. As a student, I wish to be notified more systematically and timely. One last thing about this course was the students; majority of the class was not paying attention to the lecturers and presenters which I found so disrespectful and I believe one of the reasons for this distraction was the timing of the class. Everyone was so tired already and it was not easy to listen with a full concentration till 7 pm. ",

It does expose students to a breadth of people and literature, spanning the public health field, however, the overall lack of critical methodology, time spent reading publications and listening to professors of unrelated topic areas, and the final project, do not serve research-based students very well.
