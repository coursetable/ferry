            "\u00a0I developed practical knowledge of organic chemical syntheses by taking this course. I learned about Diels-Alder cycloadditions, Friedel-Crafts acylations, Fischer esterifications, alcohol oxidations, and aldol condensations. I also learned how to interpret NMR spectra. I developed lab safety skills, as well as technique skills. The course solidified my skills of performing reflux, recrystallization, vacuum filtration, IR spectroscopy, and TLC. ",
            "\u00a0Solidified skills in organic chemistry lab techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Reflux, TLC, IR, chemical synthesis ",
            "\u00a0Not much, other than seeing that the reactions you learn in orgo really happen. ",
            "\u00a0I learned and re-emphasized organic chemistry techniques taught in the first semester of the lab sequence. We practiced writing lab reports and improved our preparation for labs through experimental plans. The most challenging but interesting part of the lab course was learning about proton NMR. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to reflux. Took the class off-sequence, so it made me keep my organic chemistry knowledge fresh in my mind. Learned how several laboratory techniques work. ",
            "\u00a0Organic chemistry ",
            "\u00a0I reviewed many techniques from first semester orgo lab which was very helpful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course teaches reactions and mechanisms relevant to chemical syntheses very clearly. The TA lectures are clear, and the course packet has all information needed to prepare for lab ahead of time. The requirement to submit experimental plans before each lab ensures that every student knows what he or she is doing that day.\r\nWeaknesses: The only real weakness with taking the off-sequence lab has to do with the students taking it, not the instructor or TA. Some of the students taking the course obviously did not care about it and had no motivation to actually understand the material; they were only concerned with finishing the lab early. They also seemed rather disrespectful toward the TA. It was not the most intellectual environment. Again, the instructor and TA are absolutely not at fault here. ",
            "\u00a0The TA and Dr. Dimeglio were amazing and super helpful. The course helped me learn about lab techniques, it could be better if there was more experimentation rather than only following directions, but the course did meet the goal of learning lab techniques and learning practical aspects of reactions. ",
            "\u00a0Overall wonderful; always looked forward to spending Wednesday afternoon with my TA and lab ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty solid, for the intro orgo lab. But the course doesn't give any insight into what organic chemistry research might be, so adding that element will improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-designed and laid back course. Prof. DiMeglio is awesome and so supportive, as are the TA's. Just do your EP's and consult the course packet when you're writing the post-lab assignments and you'll do great. ",
            "\u00a0Overall good course. For the PLA and PLB I lost points for things I would never have predicted before writing them because they were too specific to be put in the writing guide we were to follow. I'm not sure what the solution for preventing that would be, but it was a nuisance. ",
            "\u00a0Really depends on the TA you get ",
            "\u00a0The grading in this course is ridiculous, though I am sure that the teaching staff of this course have heard this many times. It seems silly that students are losing points over formatting and typos so that their final grade is low, when in actuality, the students performed all of the experiments diligently, understood all the concepts, and truly felt they learned organic chemistry lab techniques. For example, I once received a 8/10 on an EP and there was no comment on why I had lost those points on my returned paper. When I emailed my TA to ask what I did wrong, he said I had not written the page number in the corner. This is not teaching me anything except resentment. I understood the experiment perfectly well, I had filled out the actual substance of the EP correctly, but I lost points because of page numbers. I understand that this course is supposed to teach not just chemistry techniques but also general experimental design and reporting practices, which is perhaps why grading is so stringent on formatting guidelines. But the grading does seem excessively harsh, especially because real journals do not even have this unforgiving of criteria! In the end, I can only conclude that this grading style is meant to demoralize students, because it is not serving to teach anything. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is incredibly well-organized. The workload consists of one experimental plan per week and two partial lab reports. The experimental plans are easy to compose and ensure that you actually know what you are doing when you get to lab. The lab reports are very easy and quick to write, especially compared to other labs offered in the Chemistry Department. The expectations for all assignments are made very clear before you begin working on them. You also learn a lot of practical techniques and reactions relevant to syntheses. ",
            "\u00a0Probably you're taking it for a requirement so :-) ",
            "\u00a0Need for premed ",
            "\u00a0Nope unless you have to take it, but I only say that the information from the course will only be necessary if you are entering the fields (major) relevant to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's very relaxing and teaches you how to be a better organic chemist. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you need to take it. The course was tedious at times because we had to make sure all work was formatted correctly and setups were done properly. This is how it should be, the course should teach conscientiousness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class, but really depends on the TA you get ",

Otherwise, avoid for sake of your sanity. "
