            "\u00a0Taking this course allowed me to have a greater understanding of the Chinese economy, and provided me with a broader perspective on the future that isn't simply centered on the West. I think that this course did an adequate job of describing the challenges that China has faced and will continue to face, and how those problems impact the rest of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about synthesizing social, political, and economic elements throughout history in order to extrapolate for the future of China. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the recent history of China (starting with Mao) and a lot about the issues facing China right now and what China should consider to fix these issues. Specifically we discussed issues about environment, current account surplus, corruption, social stability etc and how rebalancing could help address these issues. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a deeper understanding of issues underlying China's economic development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about modern China that I never really knew before. This country has so much to offer the world, and I wish more Yalies took this course to get a pro-China viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0Broad introduction to economic analysis of China, historical (post-Mao), present (2007-2017) and future. Roach is an expert in the field, and it shows. You walk away knowing a lot about a complex subject area. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the historical rise of the Chinese economy and transitional models that China employed as a means of generating hyper growth. We also learned about the many challenges and issues that china continues to face as it becomes a world power. ",
            "\u00a0This course left me with a very clear understanding of the codependence of the American and Chinese economies over the past few decades, and how it will evolve in the future. Additionally, I learned a lot of specifics on what exactly China will need to do to shift to a new growth model. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered various aspects of the Chinese economy and political system with a focus on how the Chinese economy is shifting. ",
            "\u00a0I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. It definitely has some interesting material, but it often felt more like a poli sci class than an econ class. Sure, Professor Roach includes lots of graphs with economic data, but you're really more responsible for knowing Chinese policy decisions. With that being said, I don't think this class really helped me better understand economics. Professor Roach pretty much gives you his thesis, gives evidence to support his thesis, and expects you to repeat his thesis on the exams and paper. The entire course can be summarized into about 5 sentences, and then everything you learn supports that. I felt that this made the material much less interesting since you're really being tested on reiterating what Professor Roach says. "

            "\u00a0Every lecture after the midterm was exactly the same. ",
            "\u00a0The course served as a great introduction to China's economy, but it can be repetitive at times. A lot of the points will also be obvious for those who closely follows China in economic news or have read Prof. Roach's op-eds and book. ",
            "\u00a0The course has certain themes and it sometimes feels like we are constantly discussing the same things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very knowledgeable professor, Interesting and edifying lectures, Freedom to choose topic for the essay, Interesting readings, Every lecture starts with a current event usually, really fair exams that emphasize students showing what they know\r\nWeaknesses: No major weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I think that the lecture and section periods both did a very good job of explaining the material, and providing enough context for the base ideas of the lecture to make the substance interesting. The presentations given throughout the semester in section allowed for a greater understanding of the material outside of what Prof. Roach chose to focus on in lecture. Additionally, at least in our section, our TF chose to give presentations that were outside of the scope of lecture, and thus provided a broader insight into the overall trajectory of the course. The class could see some more variety though -- I felt that if one had read Prof. Roach's book and headlines pertaining to China, it would be just like taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion sections felt a bit disconnected from the lecture material sometimes, overall very solid course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of interesting material presented in a very boring way. ",
            "\u00a0While lectures were very interesting, I think the structure of sections can be modified. When he had section wide discussions and debates sections was very engaging, but listening to student presentations on material we just covered in lecture was not, I don't think, the best use of time. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, boring lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course seems to rely on a central structure that helps you digest all the information, but I wish I had been made more aware of some of the tangential issues we discussed towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Roach gives very informative lectures, and the subject matter of the lectures is directly tested on the midterm and final. The paper is a good test of your ability to research a subject on China on your own. Very informative course. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was good: the first half better than the second, I felt. Section wasn't always super prepared but it was educational. Prof Roach does know what he is talking about and provided incredible insight. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a great course, but gets quite repetitive. Professor Roach has a clear thesis that he reiterates each lecture, and by the end it almost seems like every lecture is the same as the last one. Perhaps it would be more intellectually stimulating to discuss theories that he disagrees with and why they are or aren't wrong. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was Prof. Roach's lectures. Grade transparency could be improved with this course. ",
            "\u00a0To be honest this barely felt like an econ class. It's more of a poli sci/global class but with more economic graphs. My main critique is that the class is really more about learning Professor Roach's thesis than about learning about the Chinese economy. I suppose in some ways the class was well-structured, but not necessarily in a good way. Professor Roach has his central thesis that informs the entire course, and all the materials and topics support it. I don't think this class really teaches critical thinking. \r\n\r\nOne way to improve it would be to make it less Roach-centric; for example, discuss the opinions of economists or policy specialists that disagree with Professor Roach. When contrarian opinions are brought up, Roach pretty much refutes these to further strengthen his own thesis. I can't really blame Professor Roach for being biased toward his own opinion, but imagine if a history class were based entirely on the work of one historian. I think a great idea to improve this course would be to bring in other economists and have a debate between them and Professor Roach, with questions provided by students and moderated by the TAs. "

            "\u00a0Material gets very repetitive was interesting enough. Definitely skews towards being a gut. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because you learn a lot in class and during section, but it is also very straightforward and fun to engage with the material.  The course will also become increasingly relevant moving in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this course is general enough so that for someone who has at least an interest in macroeconomics, China, or an understanding of the rise of the global economy, then they would be interested in taking this class. It doesn't really require one to be an Econ major, but I think that if you wanted to get the content of the class without the commitment of actually taking the class, one could just read Prof. Roach's book. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course if you are interested in the future of China-US relations and China in general ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of interesting material, however it is presented in the most boring manner possible. Not that much work except for the presentation in section, the paper, and a midterm and a final. I'm not sure I'd recommend this class since there probably are more interesting Econ electives out there but it's still an interesting class to take because you'll learn a lot about China and it's economy. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class! The class is a midterm, final, 15 pg final paper, and section participation/presentation. The lectures are really interesting, but the whole course begins to follow a very similar story that is reiterated again and again. However, I think to understand the nuances and to get the most of the class, I would recommend doing the readings! I think at times it is easy to put this class off, but you should try your best to keep up with the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in the economic aspect of China, this is an informative class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good class to take for an econ credit. Even students who won t receive a major credit, I'd still recommend the class if you have any sort of interest in learning about China. The material is interesting and is well taught by professor Roach. ",
            "\u00a0China is a rising power in our world, and is vitally important for understanding the future geopolitical economic order; everyone should take a class like this. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great credit D class to take. Very interesting. Not a lot of work if you are taking it credit D ",
            "\u00a0Roach gives great lectures, even if they aren't the most engaging. They tell you his views on China but leave room open to come to your own conclusions, which will come in handy on the midterm and final. The paper isn't too bad either, and there is very light course load week to week. Great course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course and you will learn the basics of the Chinese economic system and try to understand how china can progress even further. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you're interested in the Chinese economy and where it's going in the near future. There is a very clear thesis to this class, so don't take it expecting to get a nuanced understanding of academic debates; you will simply very deeply absorb one particular view, namely that of Professor Roach. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in China and the Chinese economy. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I found The Next China pretty disappointing. The class is more oriented toward learning Professor Roach's central thesis rather than critical thinking. I don't think this class made me better understand economics. Ultimately, I guess the class suffers from being pretty gutty. If you need an econ/global credit but don't really like economics, this class is perfect because it feels more like a poli sci class often. The workload is pretty moderate, but I didn't find it that easy because you're pretty much graded on reiterating Professor Roach's opinion and I skipped class somewhat often. "
