            "\u00a0I learned a vast amount about modern Japan, and I also feel like my anthropological-style writing has improved. I came into the class having never taken an anthropology course, and I came out with a much more critical and less generalized understanding of Japan and feeling comfortable with writing an anthropological paper. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Japanese society as it exists today, and how it has changed over time. I also learned how to effectively write long papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the trends and institutions of Japanese society, as well as how to evaluate these trends in the context of future development and identity politics. I gained a lot of insight into the study of anthropology, especially with regards to how anthropological field research is conducted.\r\n\r\nThis course also taught me how to analyze cultural trends based on statistics and field observations/ethnographies in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the challenges that Japan has faced, are facing, and will face in the future. As this was the first anthropology course that I took, I learned a lot about how anthropologists see the world and how its a little different from other social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much more nuanced and well-informed view of modern Japanese society. The course raised aspects of life in Japan that I had never considered before, as well as topics that I had some familiarity with but had never considered in light of larger structures and histories of Japanese society. Every week was full of interesting readings and in class discussion that I was always eager to discuss outside of class with friends. The course also helped me practice my social science writing skills, and how to think critically and consider many sides to each issue. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of skill in drawing arguments and analyses from readings done in class. Additionally, I think my writing skills developed more throughout this semester through movie responses and papers. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamental aspects about Japanese society that explains the evolving trends of behavior. ",
            "\u00a0This class definitely provided a solid survey of topics in modern-day Japan, and consistently put our preconceptions about Japan in dialogue with the topics of focus. ",
            "\u00a0A better, more objective understanding od Japanese culture and the structure of society via its development following world war 2 through modern times. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed skills in reading comprehension and analysis by connecting oftentimes disparate readings with one another. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the modernization of Japan as well as the numerous factors (historical, political, etc) that are involved in curating the image of the nation that is widely understood today. The class also introduced ethnographic works and incorporated a variety of resources in explaining contemporary issues such as aging, the school-to-work transition, common stereotypes, the health system, and other fascinating elements of Japanese culture and society. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth understanding of Japanese cultural and social fabric since the post-war era; exposure to famous anthropological theories and their relevance to Japanese society ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the social structure of Japan and about the contemporary problems that the nation faces. It was a great overview and analysis of socioeconomic issues ranging from womenomics to the use of robotics to target low birthdate. The class also helped to define broader sociology terms that changed my understanding of social structures. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a working understanding of post WWII Japanese History. More detailed understanding of rise of Japanese housewife and salaryman, intricacies of globalization, and the burst of the bubble economy. Also became acquainted with some ideas/concepts key to anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of modern Japan and the cultural and historical circumstances that have led Japan to where it is today ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the cultural, historical, and societal changes in Japan in the Modern era. I also learned to analyze and extrapolate info from related texts, films, and sources. Overall, I learned about people's experiences in a nation and culture similar but different to ours in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about Japans political, social, and economic climate. ",
            "\u00a0This course does exactly what it says it will and more- I gained a much greater understanding of modern Japanese society and culture along with the history that lead up to it. However, the biggest lesson to be taken from the course is that there is always so much more to learn, and that issues are always far more complicated than they're made to seem. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt I came to understand the Japanese people, their culture, and their society on a much deeper level than I've been exposed to previously. By gaining insight into Japan's past, I saw how its social values and norms evolved throughout time and came to be what they are today. As a consequence, my view of the Japanese people was complicated, something that I believe really helped me realize the complexities of their culture. \r\n\r\nThe diversity in written assignments also helped me develop various writing styles and ways of thinking. For example, the midterm paper allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of Japan through a creative writing piece. This assignment allowed me to explore more artistic writing styles and made me think about how I could seamlessly incorporate aspects of Japanese culture through a character's actions and thoughts (whether I was able to achieve that though is up for debate!). This style contrasted with the final research paper, which allowed me to thinking critically about how my topic of choice could influence the future of Japan. I believe this assignment helped develop a more formal way of writing that is suited toward academic work. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I believe this course really helps develop a different perspective when examining a culture. I believe that the process of learning about another culture resembles scientific research. When I was working in a biology lab, I noticed that scientific findings can be quite contradictory as times: one publication may say this macromolecule does one thing while the next says it does another. Understanding culture is similar in several ways. For example, some people may engage in a set of gender practices to exert dominance while others may engage in the same set to promote equality. These types of complications are what make culture complex and must be embraced for a more wholistic understanding, a concept that wasn't so tangible before taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided an in depth look into modern Japanese society from the perspective of an introductory anthropology course. "

            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course was how wonderfully organized and thought-out it was. Every reading/film was fascinating and relevant, and the class itself was extremely engaging. I was never bored. Another strength was the degree to which I was challenged. This course didn't take over my life, but I also didn't feel like it was a breeze. It requires time and effort, but I never felt like that time and effort was spent in vain.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is the number of assignments. I think there only needs to be one film response rather than two. I didn't feel like I got that much out of the second film response. ",
            "\u00a0Essentially everything about this class was a strength. Professor LBvB is absolutely amazing, and she made the class extremely interesting. The only possible \"weakness\" of this course is that it requires a lot writing - more than other WRs; personally, I enjoyed all of the writings, but you should expect to dedicate a decent amount of time to this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class was extremely straightforward. There were never any surprises, and the syllabus is crystal clear with regards to what the class expects from students. \r\nContent-wise, I found the material interesting and at times challenging, but in ways that altered my perspective of how to best approach writing about social issues and economic trends. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I took this class fully expecting it to be a lecture, but the small class size led Professor LeBaron von Baeyer to occasionally give students the opportunity to discuss readings and course material. This was not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel that the in-class discussion component of the class should be more emphasized in the syllabus because it completely caught me off guard. Also, the amount of reading was quite a lot relative to other classes I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0I think that having TFs for the course was great. I think that the class would have to be much smaller if there wasn't TF support, as having Dr. LeBaron von Baeyer meet with 30 something students about their writing would be too much. But I really enjoyed the format of the class where we submitted discussion posts before class. I forced me to do the reading and engage with the material so I was prepared to be involved during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well organized and well structured. Everything in the course was interesting and well integrated, including film screenings, in class lecture and discussion, writing assignments, and readings.\r\n\r\nI have no particular recommendations to improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0It was very well thought out in terms of its organization of lectures and variety of assignments. Sometimes I fell a bit behind the readings and some of the readings felt more random and tangential from the purpose of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor LeBaron von Baeyer was fantastic. She gave us excellent lectures, fascinating readings, and copious amounts of rich feedback on work. When I was writing 10 or 15-page papers, this was extraordinarily appreciated! The only, extremely minor gripe I had with the class was its classroom structure. It was a lecture dressed up as a seminar, and juggled between Professor LeBaron von Baeyer lecturing our 30-something person class, small break-out group discussions, and responses to discussion questions written by other classmates the night before. It was really strange. Sometimes it worked, but there was something uncanny about knowing classmates in other parts of the room only by their voices and never being given much opportunity to interact with them (as one would in a seminar). I understand this is a limitation of the large enrollment class, but I think it would nice if Professor would either make it an official lecture class or cut it down to a seminar size. ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting course material and readings, however class size may have been too large for a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The modified requirements for those taking the class as a social science versus writing credit definitely eased the workload slightly. The freedom of choice for essay topics was also definitely a strength, as was the degree to which participation was encouraged in class. ",
            "\u00a0As a music student I had to miss or leave early for many classes due to conflicts with performances or rehearsals. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the teaching, the readings, and the overall organization of the course. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor LeBaron's selection of materials and topics provided a very comprehensive look into a wide variety of topics. Lectures were always engaging and thought-provoking and I found the weekly discussion posts helpful to summarize key points and arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings are informative, lectures are engaging, writing assignments reinforce understanding and provoke thought about Japanese society \r\nWeaknesses: readings are a bit repetitive and too long at the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0The class incorporates discussion and the class usually does the reading so people have great insight that deepens the topic. It was structured to help out students and I am not usually a great writer, but clear feedback from the instructor/TAs made the class of enjoyable and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I really don't have anything to complain about. It'd be cool to like go deeper on like understanding Japanese history both pre and post WWII. Most of my edits would be towards the teaching assistants, actually. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course with interesting material that truly inspires students to be interested in what they are learning. The professor was amazing and the assignments were a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-structured and allows for a lot of helpful discussion, engagement and input. The essay prompts are also thorough but usually pretty flexible. Maybe less nightly reading but besides that great class. ",
            "\u00a0The biweekly discussion questions were a fantastic idea because they made us actually do all of the readings, much to our enjoyment. This made paper-writing far easier. The in-class environment was full of students broadcasting their ideas or opinions, which I think is unusual in a class this size. Most people seemed to talk at least once in a given class period. The lectures provided info in addition to the readings, so nothing ever felt repetitive. Honestly, I can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This course is engaging and interesting. It provides many opportunities to think critically about the Japanese culture and society and to discuss these thoughts with your peers. The discussion-based nature of the course was definitely one of its strengths. Without them, I do not think such a level of understanding could have been reached. I also think the questions that students had to pose for each classes' readings significantly enhanced the level of engagement with and understanding of the text. \r\n\r\nIt's hard to think of any weaknesses off the top of my head, however. ",
            "\u00a0This course was accessible to non-majors, and lectures were engaging and interesting. Although the class was a small lecture, participation was welcome, and it had more of the feel of a large seminar. The course felt targeted toward first-years and sophomores, however, and some aspects suffered as a result (reading responses could tend to be fairly reiterative, and some of the in-class activities felt unnecessary, while more projects like the final research paper would have been welcome) "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Japan is a fascinating and complex country, and Professor LeBaron von Baeyer is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. The readings and films are really fascinating, and it was a genuine joy to go to class. Do be prepared to do a lot of writing: there are two weekly reading responses, 3 short papers, one midterm paper, and a final research paper. It is a lot, but it was pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; in fact, I have to many of my friends. Professor LBvB is one of the best professors I've ever had - she's intelligent, knowledgeable, caring, and gives great feedback. I went into this class as a STEM major with almost no knowledge about Japan, but the class immediately captivated me. The readings and assignments are all fun to do, and the class is extremely well organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in studying the cultural, social, and economic trends of Japan. This class is highly engaging, and some unusual yet captivating topics are covered, such as gender minorities, alternate lifestyles, and protests in Japan. The writing section was also very helpful because the TFs were always willing to lend their time to students for feedback and suggestions.\r\n\r\nProfessor LeBaron von Baeyer had a way of not making lectures monotonous by incorporating visual media, videos, and discussions into them, which I appreciated. Her passion for the subject comes across in her teaching which is wonderful, so I definitely recommend her course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I think it's a good WR class that is accessible to those in the science. It also cover a lot of information that I wouldn't have known otherwise, but it quite interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any student with an interest in Japan and Japanese society, regardless whether you grew up your whole life in Japan or have no idea what Japan is. I think everyone of all backgrounds can learn a great deal from this course and re-examine your previous views on Japan. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class was highly informative, but also didn't feel redundant. This class offered new perspectives on the western view of Japan and broke some myths surrounding Japan that I may not have even considered given the fact that I do not know much about it. The assignments are regular, so it is important to establish some sort of routine, but the workload isn't overly tedious or difficult either. \r\nThis was definitely one of my favorite classes this semester, Professor von Baeyer is very good at teaching and presenting material through different media. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Even if you have no idea if you're interested in Japan or anthropology. Now, if you're not used to reading 100+ pages a week, it may take some adjusting, but it is well worth it because the readings only get better and better. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course as a survey of topics in modern-day Japan, as the course is heavily geared towards addressing preconceived ideas about Japan which are challenged throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A variety of interesting readings and engaging, well paced lectures made this a very educational and informative course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is amazing even if you're not interested in anthropology or know very little about Japan. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course if you are remotely interested in Japan or anthropology! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, you learn a lot about Japanese society and culture, and Professor LeBaron is amazing. The grading is fair, and you get ample time to work on each assignment. The only caveat is that the workload is fairly large: you have to submit 2 reading responses per week and write multiple essays over the term ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in learning more about social structures and post modern issues. This class helps to discuss trends in several countries including low birth rate and high elder population. It gives you a lot of knowledge on Japan as well which is a nation that is often not studied or well understood outside of stereotypes. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. It's great. If even the name interests you, I'd recommend taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S FANTASTIC!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It's an amazing class for anyone interested in modern Japan and the effects of modernization in general. The professor is so engaging and the readings and assignments are fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to someone if they've ever had even the slightest interest in Japan. The class and course material was very well organized and the readings that supplemented lecture were all quite interesting. Class was guided by lecture, but there was still a lot of room for engaged discussions and everyone's interest in the class was evident in their participation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for a solid WR credit, or if you just want to learn more about Japanese society and culture. The discussions and texts are very interesting, and the professor does a pretty good job and balancing content and analysis. Also the workload is a good amount but not excessive. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone curious about Japan or just learning about other cultures and societies. Examining Japan through this course made me re-evaluate the society and culture I've grown up in over and over again, and the issues talked about in the course are relevant to many other contexts besides Japan. Overall, a course with a great professor, incredibly interesting material, and far-reaching implications. ",
            "\u00a0I actually think I've recommended this course to every one of my friends so far! This course was definitely one of my favorite because of how engaging and interesting it was. I feel that I learned a lot about Japan's culture and society and came to appreciate them more after taking this class. However, I think how much someone enjoys this course does depend on how much effort they are willing to put in. I came in with great interest in Japan because of my love of various forms of Japanese media. As a result, I saw myself devoting a lot of time into each assignment and got a lot out of the course by doing so. However, if I were much busier or less interested in the subject, such levels of engagement might not be attainable and therefore, neither would my level of enjoyment from the course. Therefore, I would recommend this course to anyone who's willing to put in some effort into really understanding the material. Strongly recommended for those with previous interest in Japan! ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I would particularly recommend this to students who are new to the field of anthropology, and those who are interested or have some previous knowledge of Japanese culture. "
