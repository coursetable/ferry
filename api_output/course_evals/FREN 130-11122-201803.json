            "\u00a0A review of a lot of the french I had learned in high school, as well as reading new books/movies and learning more advanced grammar topics. ",
            "\u00a0There are some great books and movies in this course (though some are better than others). The day-to-day work can be gruelling and very repetitive. You learn advanced verb tenses and other grammar stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Improved listening comprehension ",
            "\u00a0I developed many different skills that improved my French a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Shite ",
            "\u00a0Having not studied French for some years, the course was difficult but I rebuilt confidence and aptitude in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. ",

            "\u00a0Well structured and a good support system. Curriculum is very well organised, though I will say the professor says you're only supposed to have 1 1/2 to 2 hours of work each night but there was regularly more. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the worst part of my semester was waking up for this class. Best part was getting to know my classmates and the occasional good joke. Overall this course was very boring and needed more engagement. The amount we actually spoke french was so little its crazy. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: good material covered; enjoyed films and novels\r\nWeakness: meets a lot; a lot of work; you burn out; attendance policy is too strict ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well structured. If does move very quickly, so maybe if there were more time while learning grammar to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are well selected and the teaching is strong, however the course packet activities are somewhat confusing: often you will start an activity on a grammatical structure having not been taught how to use it, meaning you have no idea how to do the activity correctly, which can be frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The lessons in class came after the lessons in the handbook. The audio programs in the handbook were not that useful because it offered no understandable teaching of a lesson nor easily understandable explanation/answers to the correct answers "

            "\u00a0Yes, Madame Burton is an amazing teacher who makes you learn French at such a high level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because despite the workload it is a successful method of teaching french and I genuinely feel like I improved ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you have a good reason to learn french. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not because it is very difficult and has a huge workload for a mere language requirement. Unless French is that student's goal in life, do not take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who felt strongly about learning French. I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course was difficult but you do learn a lot, so if youre ok with that then its worth it. "
