            "\u00a0Some great cases initially, especially the Daily Table, Aravind and Kushi Baby. However, some others weren't really innovative or truly public health and it became monotonous towards the end. I think one or two of the weaker cases could be dropped for a more in depth analysis on content in the Professor's book. \r\n\r\nI appreciate the reason behind the classroom participation being graded, but at the same time it resulted in so many synthetic forced statements with people just saying things for the sake of scoring a contribution point rather than generating genuine discussion and it became irritating. There were also some people who literally did not say more than 1 or 2 answers the entire semester, so not sure how they can be effectively graded given such a huge chunk is participation.  This should be changed for next year. More written assignments would be better and reduce the participation grade in order to facilitate genuine discussion. Appreciate not everyone is comfortable speaking up in class, but still it's graduate school and everyone should have a go. So if you're not comfortable with classroom discussion then don't take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were the guest speakers, case studies, and the instructor and her ability to facilitate discussion and learning. As a forestry student, I would have enjoyed more of a focus on intersections of public health and the environment, but I also understand that that was not part of the syllabus. "
