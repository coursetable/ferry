            "\u00a0My grammar improved a lot in this course, especially more detailed topics. The presentations and oral exam also helped me improve my speaking abilities. The variance of the units also exposed me to a lot of new vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing, reading, thinking, listening, and speaking skills in Spanish. Beyond my immense improvement in language itself, I have come to appreciate even more Latin American literature and aesthetics through Professor Baffi. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking, reading and writing in Spanish improved quite a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Sharpened up Spanish speaking, reading and writing skills. We learned complex S clauses, passive voice, uses of SE, subjunctive, present perfect, past perfect etc. (more complex grammar structures) and how to incorporate that into our speaking as well as writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills to help me write, read and speak well in spanish. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: variation in readings and subject matter, good class discussion, good work with partners and small groups, enforcement of grammar. Weaknesses: sometimes we seemed to exhaust a subject rather than moving on when discussion ran out, some of the Supersite homework became busy work ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course and I would change almost nothing about it. If possible, I would have preferred to have read a little more literature at the end of the course. Despite this, I still loved every day of the class! ",
            "\u00a0It feels like a drag - constant assessments seem unnecessary. ",

            "\u00a0I do not think that I have heard anyone say a 100% truthful positive thing about the L4 spanish curriculum. There are many flaws. It moves very quickly and some of the assessments do not really give the opportunity to showcase the knowledge that they are trying to test. (Quizzes should not be so short and purposefully difficult where it is very easy to lose lots and lots of points because the directions are unclear.... (THIS WAS A COMMENT MADE BY A PROFESSOR!)  The book also is not necessarily the best for all of the material being taught. I understand that it is because it comes with the online component but even that is not perfect. It should be graded based on effort and completeness NOT based on the grades that VHL gives because you can get something completely wrong for putting a period at the end of a sentence or not capitalizing something OR just for not matching how VHL would write it even though it IS grammatically correct.... OH AND IT IS SO EXPENSIVE, which, when you have to buy a new code very year, is very difficult for those of us who financially are struggling.\r\nAdditionally, at certain points in the course it is slightly ridiculous to have VHL homework AND written homework AND to need to study for a quiz or prepare a group project. On nights before exams there really should not be mandatory VHL but rather suggested exercises. (To be honest I learned more from searching free online practice exercises for the grammar than I did using the VHL website). There were also points where we were very confused about what was going on because there were so many assignments/ things going on all at once.... even our professor was confused. I think that this needs to be smoothed out. \r\nThank GOD that everything was on Canvas this year, that made things at least a little bit more streamline. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student but it definitely is a lot of homework each night and there is at least one assessment every week that are pretty time consuming to prepare for so this class is definitely a commitment. The actual subject matter is never extremely difficult but the volume of work is definitely something to be aware of. ",
