            "\u00a0To think and reflect on our normal life and especially answer the question  that how we can live with the truth that we can't find the truth. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first time I took a philosophy/literature class. Professor North is very knowledgable. The class touched on lots of materials. He has a good control of the class. He also has a good sense of humor. The TA Ernest was very helpful and patient. His study with arts helped the class as well. ",
            "\u00a0I get to learn about many great theories in history like Lacan's seminar, Aristotle's text and some passages from Genesis. Also improved my writing skills and have a deeper understanding on the subject of dreams. ",
            "\u00a0First of all, I have learnt a lot of things about dreams, and how people talked about dreams. Secondly, the course provided me a different aspect to look into dreams and our life. Its not only about dreams, but also about human-beings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to reason in a philosophical setting and to criticize and analyze different types of media. I learned how to understand philosophy and hold discussions with others. "

            "\u00a0strengths: include many aspects and comprehensive\r\nweakness: sometimes some  point can't explain very clearly ,some confusion may come into being ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the material is really densed. They are more about creating an experience in my view. ",
            "\u00a0This course involves a lot of free discussions and interactions. The way of guiding students to think and solve the problems is great. But occasionally the amount of reading before each class is to much and students are unable to get well-prepared. ",
            "\u00a0It offers a wide perspective on dreaming, though a more thorough introduction to philosophy and analytical discussion is always helpful to ensuring that everyone is on the \"same page\" for discussions and analysis. "

            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0YES but NO\r\nI think this class is not for everyone. It requires a specific attitude toward science and philosophy. It's not very applicable. However, it's very thought-provoking. The readings are well organized. It's like an opera. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great class where you can read materials from different fields and learn. ",
            "\u00a0I will only recommend this course for the students with excellent English comprehensive and just want to have fun. If one is an international student whose mother language is not English, it will be really hard for him to follow the course since those words referred during the class are not that common used. If one want to learn practical knowledge or would like to search for an answer, the course wouldnt provide him with that. Thus, unless one is an excellent English user and only want to have fun, I will not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it; I think it teaches necessary skills and methods of thinking and analysis, and it helped me change my perspectives and worldviews for the better. "
