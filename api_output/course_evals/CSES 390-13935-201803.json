            "\u00a0This course gives each student a working knowledge of venture capital terminology and systems as well as literacy in several different, more specialized areas of investing and entrepreneurship. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the venture capital (VC) process (i.e. term sheets, investment selection, relationships between LPs and VCs, etc.) as well as about the world of VC - what it means to be a player in it, what people are like, how important relationships are in it. I also learned about different branches of VC like impact investing, tech investing, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about venture capital, including how to identify good and bad deals, negotiate term sheets, collaborate with startups and work to develop and invest in a community. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a very solid academic foundation in what it takes to create and finance a startup. We touched on what this process is like from the perspective of founders and the perspective of venture capitalists. Prof Torres also brought in a lot of engaging speakers and took us on a field trip to Consensys (a blockchain firm in Brooklyn) and Company (Grand Central startup incubator). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the mechanics of how venture capital works and some of the key dilemmas (business and ethical) VCs and entrepreneurs face. This is class is an excellent intro to the industry, and I learned a lot outside of the core topics such as what factors to look for in a team and how to do primary research. ",
            "\u00a0Started this course with only a superficial understanding of venture capital  This course gives a rare dive into the world of VC: the VC industry, finding good deals, term sheets, investment memos, building your network, talking the VC lingo, etc etc ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me meaningful exposure to Venture Capital as well as the world of emerging technologies. It shaped my career interests and thoughts on what I intend to achieve in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various topics in venture capital and gained a better overall understanding of the field. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of venture capital and the important ingredients for a successful startup ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT about VC.  The mechanics of it, the more ephemeral aspects of it, interesting cases and examples, and personal insights from professionals in the field ",
            "\u00a0The mechanics of VC investments and specifics in term-sheets, what factors to look for when evaluating start-ups, practical, ethical, and professional dilemmas in the pursuit of returns, how to build a start-up community ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the venture capital industry at large, and picked up a few lessons about life on the way.\r\n\r\nProfessor Torres comes to campus to educate and support his students, and goes to great lengths beyond the scope of the class to lift up anyone that he can.  For prospective students reading this review, take the time to engage with him after class; he's a great guy. "

            "\u00a0The course is great at being discussion based and prompting discussion from each student. ",
            "\u00a0Foremost strength of this course is Professor Torres. He is an EXCELLENT professor and a really fun person. He does a superb job of organizing the semester and each class period, yet he's receptive to student feedback and engagement. Professor Torres has a gift for teaching this class - he shows students that he has high expectations of them without making the course seem intimidating or like you'd need prior knowledge to participate. It's obvious he genuinely values each person in his class, whoever they are.\r\nThe ability to engage with players in the VC field is also a huge strength - I loved having speakers come to class and being able to hear their first-hand experience, opinions, etc. Professor Torres does a great job of bringing people in, preparing students for class speakers, and moderating conversation with them during class. \r\nReadings were also great and I liked the way the course material was organized. Also really appreciated the assignments - the open-ended and creative elements of the midterm and final were right up my alley.\r\n\r\nI only have a few, small improvements: I found the readings on the bitcoin/blockchain topics really hard to understand and would have liked perhaps a more basic, in-person primer before having to dive into those readings. Professor Torres also recognized that all the speakers he invited to class were white men, and I would have appreciated greater diversity in representation in the VC field. I think this will see a change next time the course is offered. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Torres is very adamant in answering our questions, connecting us to his resources and helping us grasp the material. As a low income student, I wish some of the course material was financially more accessible. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. More than any other class, I feel like this one has prepared me for my career and helped me decide what I want to pursue after college. Prof Torres was extremely passionate and engaging and the seminar style was perfect for class discussions. The extra speakers were fantastic. \r\n\r\nThe only way to improve this class is to ensure that it is offered every year as a res college seminar so that more students can experience it. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions in this course were great, and I felt the only weakness is that sometimes we didn't have time to come to a conclusion on certain topics, and instead had to move on. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the quality of the readings in the syllabus all of which were very informative and well curated. I also liked that we had a litany of professionals in the industry to give us a firsthand perspective on Venture Capital.\r\n\r\nThis course could have been improved by going deeper on the technical aspects of VC including term sheets and cap tables. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course was the variety of topics we covered. In addition, another strength of the course were the guest speakers that were brought in; they added another level of insight that we wouldn't have gotten from just discussing the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course, no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The way the course is structured is very well thought out. The readings were great, as were the blog assignments. Prof Torres also put together a great field trip for us One weakness was the lack of diversity in the speakers.  Another weakness was that sometimes it was hard to get a word in- one pitfall of having such a structured class was that a few times I was either cut off or not able to speak because we were rushed from one topic to the next.  I think that can create a sense of competing to speak, where a few dominant voices end up taking up the most time and space in class.  This left me frustrated at times.  On the other hand, I was grateful to have covered so much ground.  \r\n\r\nI really liked the investment memo, and wish it had been worth more of our grade!  One tweak for the future could be creating a google sheets where people can put the startups that they have claimed -  I reached out to a couple of people who were already being interviewed by someone for our class, so I think a shared document could help prevent that. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jorge is extremely relatable and personal. His enthusiasm and commitment to the course really made it shine. \r\n\r\nClass time was too short. We would have benefitted from longer discussions and time to question guest speakers who were top professionals in their fields. ",
            "\u00a0The class as I took it was a series of weekly seminar discussions where you really had the opportunity to engage and learn, or not.  At the end, there's a big paper--> maybe some work could be done to better balance the work over time.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, as a senior with other obligations, I was a big fan of this arrangement.

            "\u00a0If you are thinking of becoming a founder or are interested in VC as a career, take this course to give yourself a taste of the industry. I think everyone else will certainly learn in the class, but the material may be more technical or less interesting if you are not actively engaged with the industry as a career. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Professor Torres is great. You don't need to know anything about VC to be in this class. And if you don't know anything about it, it's probably not what you think it is. VC isn't at all like anything in the finance - it's centered around supporting people and exciting ideas. I really think anyone would like this class - it's high quality discussion (often with guest speakers who work in VC), interesting assignments, good readings, and a very cool professor. Take it if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you want an introductory course to Venture Capital, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely apply to this class. If you get in, absolutely TAKE IT unless you have another absolutely unavoidable conflict. This class will teach you so much about what the real-world of entrepreneurship and venture capital is like. It helped me better define what career I want to pursue after college, and it gave me tangible skills that I'll carry into everything I do. \r\nRegardless if you're looking into creating your own startup or becoming a venture capitalist (or neither), this class has a lot to offer you. Prof Torres is extremely engaging and dedicated to the class. The readings are interesting and make for great class discussions. The professor also invites a lot of guest speakers (I think we had 5-6, if not more), and we took a field trip this year to see Consensys (blockchain firm in Brooklyn) and Company (Grand Central Tech incubator). This class will introduce you to so many people and help you grow your career in ways you will not expect. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent whether you are (or are planning to be) an entrepreneur or are just interested in the content. 100% would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend because there is no class like it at Yale  well organized survey course with engaging material, guest speakers, and field tripyoull leave with an optimism for (also a more realistic view of) innovation and startups. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student interested in startups or VC. I think that this class is not good for those interested in finance broadly. This is one of the few courses at Yale that caters to those who are genuinely interested in starting their own companies or want to learn something practical about the outside world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. As someone who knew very little about venture capital prior to this course, I learned a lot this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely great course. Professor Torres is a fantastic teacher and the course material is incredibly useful/interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Can't recommend this class enough! ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  This class is engaging - you will never get bored.  You will learn a lot.  As someone who was interested in VC before, I felt like this course gave me a more nuanced and realistic perspective of the industry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Please take it if you're interested in becoming an entrepreneur, VC, developer, or public official dealing with tech and start-ups. You'll learn so much and leave the class with much more knowledge and confidence than before. ",
            "\u00a0Jorge Torres is just a swell dude.  He cares deeply about helping his students, and he makes himself available to educate people up to their level of interest in VC.\r\n\r\nThe class requires an application, and even if you're not super involved in the space, I highly recommend that you do apply.  He takes students of all levels of background & engagement, and really does what he can to give them a high quality education. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of the top 3 courses I have ever taken at Yale. If you have even slightest interest in startups or venture capital -- definitely take it. It is very well organized and the readings are phenomenal. You also have a guest speaker (usually, a VC manager) every other week, so it is also a great chance to network. The workload is decent but not overwhelming, especially if you are interested in venture capital. Be sure to start the final paper early, though. Professor Torres is very supportive and great at facilitating in-class discussions. Overall: 10/10 "
