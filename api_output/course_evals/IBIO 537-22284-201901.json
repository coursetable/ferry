            "\u00a0I really liked the style of the class (mainly a lecture, but with plenty of room for questions and student engagement) and thought that almost all of the lecturers were very engaging with interesting topics to discuss. Writing part of a grant is also a very useful tool that I appreciated having to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was well structured. Discussion was engaging and most new terms were explained as they arose making it easy to keep track of the discussion. Dr. O'Connor did a fantastic job of making sure faculty lecturers explained the terminology they were using and to stimulate discussion within the course by asking questions from time to time. I appreciated that homeworks were corrected in time and given back to students graded and with comments. Comments on homeworks were particularly helpful for future homeworks and for shaping our interpretation of the primary literature in general. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to have gone through the peer-review process that was discussed in the beginning of the course. Additionally, a 5 mins presentation on how to tailor a letter of intent, specific aims and the final experimental plan would have been nice to have. The examples provided for the letter of intent and specific aims were relatively straight forward, but I feel that for the experimental plan a 5-10 mins presentation on the most important points would have been nice. A good alternative would have been to provide a rubric or additional examples. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a wide range of topics, with an emphasis on translational questions. The term project is in the form of writing a grant. This project provided the students much information in what a grant should look like, what to include in a grant, and what to consider as a grant idea. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I would definitely recommend it to other students. The main reason being that the course is well-structured, facilitates learning, and keeps all students on the same page, something that many other courses at the graduate level at Yale are lacking (in other courses only students with background relevant to the research being presented actually benefit from lectures; this is definitely not the case for this course). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The topic is closely related to the health of people. The course teach the student to think about patients, and think with the focus on human immunology. I consider it valueble for we emerging immunologists to always pay attention to the translational meaning of our study. "
