One weakness of the class was that the instructor assigned a lot of \"pair problems\" during class, and we gave us way too much time for that because if we didn't know it right away, we were just sitting there waiting for him to explain the problem. I think that worked examples would have been a much better use of class time. ",

            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course was making students do pair problems. I personally did not like doing these problems as it made me uncomfortable to work with a partner when at times I did not understand the material. This aspect of the class would make me feel stressed and insecure about my math skills. A better alternative would be problems done for each individual to check understanding. Those who wish to work with others would be allowed to work with others, while those who were not yet comfortable could attempt to work out a problem on their own to see where they lie in terms of understanding a concept. ",
