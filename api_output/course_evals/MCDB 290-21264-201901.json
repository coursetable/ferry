We were told for the first exam to not write down everything [we] know.. just the answer and then in the 2nd exam a lot more points were removed for not providing enough detail for some answers. This is not to say exams were unfair (they were generally very fair), but these sorts of things can be a little annoying at times ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very effective course for teaching the material; there are no problem sets, no busy work, no extraneous text - the three midterm exams are non-cumulative and based on the lecture. As long as students attend lecture and pay attention, they have everything they need to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well taught and organized. However, it did feel rushed at some points ",
            "\u00a0I think the material is very interesting especially towards the end and it is presented clearly. The exams are fair and they are not cumulative, and I love how the class draws from cell biology, biochemistry, genetics. I think it is better than other MCDB cores out there. There is no busy work, which is great. The slides are printed out in color before each class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic course overall. Learned a ton, interesting, material, tests were well written and grading was fair, professors were great, pacing and organization great. Amazing class overall. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength was that all the information needed for the exams could be found in the lecture slides that were always provided and the lecturers always paused for questions and clarified anything as well as started off every lecture with a recap. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: little coursework outside of exams, interesting lectures ",
            "\u00a0This course  provides a broad introduction to microbiology, producing a tour of the entire field without going too much into depth in any one particular subtopic. The course lectures were interesting but could be disengaging as the semester went on. Both lecturers are prepared and passionate, and they succeeded when they connected with the students by providing real world examples of how course content links to modern day issues. The main issue was the opaque grading rubric for the three exams, upon which the entire gradebook is staked. I found that I did not receive clear feedback on improvements even after I had gone to the post-exam review session to talk with TAs about my exam. ",

            "\u00a0The three non-cumulative exam setup was perfect for the amount of material covered on each exam, and exam content and grading were extremely fair. Lectures were engaging, and the professors were cogent and excited to introduce both concepts and research in their fields. The professors printed slides for each lecture  which was sweet and extremely helpful, given that they rely on student thoughtfulness to sit down and understand a diagram to extract information, a useful science skill. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: topic material was very engaging and informative\r\nWeakness: lack of test preparation (no sections) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs and professors were always willing to hold office hours and review sessions. Having a review session was very helpful for every four lectures. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No answers provided to the practice exams which many students understand why this was the case. ",
            "\u00a0I think that while there were parts of the class were tested in a way that required the application of knowledge, much of the class is still regurgitation. While I know that it is quite difficult to write application exams in biology, I think more of the tests could be application based. However, I do enjoy that the final exam was not cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: no homework, tests, or quizzes, just three non-cumulative exams that allow you to pace yourself throughout the semester; two committed and knowledgeable professors, Jacobs-Wagner and Hatzios are quick to bring in relevant interesting outside info to supplement the material; lecture slides printed out for everyone as you walk into lecture; diverse student body from all four class years; frequent TA review sessions that are never overpopulated; recaps of the last few slides from the previous lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very few; the biggest I think was the overall curriculum, MCDB 290 is more bacteriology than a broad-spectrum microbiology course; non-bacteria material was confined to parts of the first lecture and the last lecture about viruses. Don't get me wrong: bacteriology is a fascinating and diverse topic but I think more attention could be given to other fields within microbiology. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its amazing professors (Prof. Jacobs-Wagner and Prof. Hatzios), both of whom demonstrated a vast understanding of the field of microbiology and its applications in medicine. One weakness of this class is that there aren't discussion sections to discuss the material, so you have to study the material on your own or go to optional review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that this class had Piazza or something so that students could engage with the content more. I often found that I had questions about specific slides, but the TFs are already pretty overburdened with holding office hours/review sessions that there isn't a lot of opportunity to ask exploratory questions. I think that the format as it stands - just lectures twice a week, and the only scoring coming from three midterms - is not conducive to active participation and learning. However, I think that the material is really fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Lectures fit together cohesively\r\nWeakness: What was considered a fully correct answer on exams seemed arbitrary at times. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a good pace and was broken up conceptually in a way that made sense. Office hours were available almost every day, which made them easily accessible. The independent nature of the course with no mandatory office hours was a pleasant change from other courses in the major. ",
            "\u00a0Love the connections to everyday life. Wonderful professors and excellent TAs this year. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course in general, but the fact that the grading structure is based on only two midterms and a final is something that could be changed since that makes it very hard to obtain feedback on one's progress in learning during the year. There are regular review sessions and office hours from the TA's which are extremely helpful, but still the only comprehensive practice/feedback we get are the tests. Even something small and simple like a weekly review quiz on Canvas would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The slides could be a little more comprehensive the second half of the year. Some of the wording on test questions was tricky and points were lost even where material was known. Great spread of topics and interesting lectures. Really nice professors. ",
            "\u00a0The grading of this class is solely based off of test results, which is difficult for people who do not test well. I think this class is also designed to be easy on the TAs, because most review sessions where based off of student questions and required little work from TAs. Although there were review session, they were not always helpful if the TAs were not prepared. ",
            "\u00a0well organized; lecture topics were organized with a clear progression that made all the topics make sense ",

        [
            "\u00a0Definitely over cell bio or mol bio...... a relatively painless MCDB core. Just study in advance and ask questions/clarifications ahead of time and you will be golden. The professors are both very engaging and knowledgeable in their fields, I highly recommend the class to nonmajors, and especially to MCDB majors looking to fulfill a core course requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Do you need a biology \"gut\"? If the answer is yes, this is a good course. The grading is pretty arbitrary and misses the forest for the trees (having to explicitly mention that you observe a Gram stain under light microscopy as was the case for the first midterm is silly to say the least) , but that's probably because the course is barely above high school biology in sophistication and difficulty. It's pretty easy and a breeze. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I am a non-Bio major and really loved this class. I was excited to go to class each day and never stressed about the material. My commitment mostly involved studying for one or two nights before the exams, so it was enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it. I think microbiology is one of the fields of biology where you can actually see direct connections to your daily life. There are only three tests and they are not cumulative. There is no homework. I think this is the perfect biology class. You learn a lot, and you get assessed fairly on your knowledge. It is one of the better biology cores out there, and it is a very memeable class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in biology or public health or cells. It was really informative and we covered a lot of topics. You will not understand everything the first time we go over it, but you will get so much help from the TAs. It was very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course. The professors (particularly Dr. Jacobs-Wagner) are incredible. Super kind, very engaging lecturers, committed to student learning, and teach well. Even though its a medium-sized lecture, they know many names by the end of the semester and reach out to the audience often. The material is interesting overall and the organization and pacing is great. The only graded assignments are three (non-cumulative) tests, which are very well written to test your knowledge and thinking skills, not just memorization. The tests are very reasonable and if you study you'll do well. Loved this course, probably my favorite STEM class at Yale so far, and it counts as an MCDB core class (at least as of 2019 Spring). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good course, but don't be fooled by others claiming it was easy; you still have to put in the work to get a good grade, which i did not get for the first two exams sadly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great class that is extremely interesting and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Good MCDB core course. ",
            "\u00a0I would tepidly recommend this course. To an interested student, the material may be intrinsically interesting enough that somewhat disengaging and long lectures may not be a deterrent. I think that this course can provide a solid introduction to microbiology, but it may not provide material at a satisfying level of depth--there is a stronger emphasis on covering a wider range of content, which I did appreciate to an extent. ",
            "\u00a0YESSS ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lovely MCDB core class, with an inspiring (all female) professor duo and interesting content. Good survey course, but also goes into signaling pathway details for those who want a bit of a niche challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course material, take if you're thinking about medicine/research ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great MCDB core course. I learned a lot and the support provided by the TAs and professors was great and not found in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0A solid MCDB core with only 2 midterms and a final; no quizzes mean you have to stay on top of the material but it does lighten the workload most weeks ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to those in the mcdb major. I think that the content of the class is quite interesting and the class isn't too demanding. ",
            "\u00a0I took MCDB 290 as a freshman and it has been one of my favorite courses so far. Material covers a wide variety of topics that have very practical implications in research, microbiology, pre-med/pre-vet. A very low commitment (yet by no means a gut) 250-level MCDB class that brings together students of all disciplines and years. Jacobs-Wagner and Hatzios are excellent and passionate in their fields, and the way they teach this class shows it. If your a student who can pace yourself on track and keep up with the material on your own, this class is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Microbiology to other students, especially if they are considering taking Microbio lab, as the two classes go very well together and teach you a great deal about what bacteria and viruses are, how they infect hosts, and why they are relevant to medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning about microbial life, as well as biology lab techniques/experiments to investigate microbial life. The lecture itself is pretty compelling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course helped me gain insight into how to think about research questions in the field of microbiology. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend any MCDB major or anyone interested in microbiology or immunology to take this course. It was structured and taught very well, and the lectures toward the end of the course seem like a good primer to many topics in Biology of the Immune System. The topics did not feel redundant or overlap too much with other courses I have taken in the department, which I thought was a good thing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good class if you're interested in microbio. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! Especially if you have any interest in bacterial microbiology at all. Professor Jacobs-Wagner is amazing, both inside and outside the classroom, and MCDB290 covers so many fascinating topics about bacteria (if you're looking for fungal/protist/parasite microbiology look somewhere else though as this course is mostly bacteria plus a little bit of viruses) that are amazing to learn about. As probably mentioned by others, the grading in this class is based on two midterms and a final which is a little bit annoying; for one thing the regular workload is very little since there is no homework but for another thing you'll need to be diligent about remembering or reviewing your notes. Take lots of notes! But awesome class, makes me remember why I love biology in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0yes definitely an interesting class ",
            "\u00a0It is a lighter core class than others, it is not at 9am, but it is also dry in more than a few lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for anyone looking to gain fundamental knowledge on microbes and their interactions with humans ",
            "\u00a0Strong lecture course, no section "
