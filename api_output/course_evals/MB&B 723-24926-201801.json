            "\u00a0Learned about many techniques that could be used in my research, information availability, and knowledge about my own 'thesis' project ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to really think critically about the data I am presented with and how strong it really is. It also taught me weaknesses in certain methods to look out for. "

            "\u00a0This course could easily become a full term course as it felt like much more could be covered than what is possible for a half term course. It is a good course that was not rushed nor condensed with too much information. It had a very natural progression for the type of questions being sought. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to learn more about the biology of macromolecular interactions but i t felt like we spent a lot of time talking about ways to measure and observe the interactions. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I loved it. Maybe out of personal interest and the class size was small which facilitated better interactions, but still very good. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0YES. Solid course, 10/10 would take again. Learned so many valuable techniques and resources that have continued to help with my research. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The small class size really allows you to engage with both the professor, TA, and other classmates. I believe this is a course that will teach you valuable skills that can be applied in a research career. "
