            "\u00a0This course changed my perspective on life. To think transnationally means to destablize national boundaries as meaningful and to think about how connected different parts of the world are. It means to deconstruct binary spheres of modern/traditional, global north/global south, academics/activism, etc. To consider gender and sexuality through this lens has taught me so much about transnational flows of goods, ideas, and capital and how they implicate sex and gender. Also the terms/categories/identities of LGBTIA+ and how they travel has been super interesting to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0A transnational approach to gender and sexuality (as the course title promises), which I understood to be a relatively radical, newer form of post-structuralist feminism that looked not at gender issues in isolation but often critiqued them in relation to issues of nationality, race, class, and so on. This class is a total take-down of militarized feminism, white feminism, neoliberal feminism/queer politics, and so is very helpful for people who already feel well-versed in these issues (as most people at Yale are)but want to develop sharper tools for thinking about them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to criticize and deconstruct binaries often embedded in gender and sexuality theories, including West/Non-West, Female/Male, Traditional/Modern, etc and then use these disruptions as tools towards analyzing how the flow of power and the construction of subjectivities can be problematized and expanded. I learned how to identify good theory from bad theory, how queerness can operate internationally, and how even my local surroundings is shaped by international flows of information and goods. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me gain an understanding of what transnational really meant which allowed me to look at things like language and identity in a totally different light. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis, questioning of binary, viewing issues and concepts through transnational lens. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill of learning how to visualize events and categories of thought alike through a transnational perspective. I cannot help but think about transnational implications of things that I experience in my life now. "

            "\u00a0The biggest strenght is the instructor, Evren. She was able to create an environment in which students could explore concepts freely even as she critically pushed against some assumptions we were making. There was an overall growth in learning collectively.\r\nAlso, the short papers we had to write were a unique assignment that gave us the power to theorize from our own experiences alongside scholars and texts from transnational feminists. ",
            "\u00a0This course has great readings, and is taught well. However, in seminar we often did bot get to go through all of the readings because the professor would let students say whatever they wanted whether or not it was productive. I liked how she encouraged speaking, but at times it would have been more valuable for her to talk or to challenge students thoughts. Debate was not encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class covers issues that should interest anybody interested in feminism, anti-racism, queer politics, and other types of liberal thought. The readings assigned for the class were really excellent and very thoughtful critiques of current emancipatory movements. Professor Savci was so, so, so kind and warm that she made every student feel welcome and listened to. She's also wonderfully eloquent and always has something insightful and interesting to say. The syllabus was really good because it is very cognizant about re-orienting the WGSS perspective away from America and 'mainstream' feminisms and queer politics, so you get great exposure to issues from all around the world and ways of thinking of that vis-a-vis broader power structures. The course workload is very light and Professor Savci is an extremely lenient grader. You get fun assignments were you think about course issues as they pertain to your life, so overall the class is really interesting while still fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Savci could've been more cognizant about organizing and leading seminars. As she was extremely kind and thoughtful, I think she also felt hesitant pushing back against what students were saying or cutting any student off. What happened then was often that class would devolve into a feelings-sharing session, barely related to the text, rather than critical analyses of the ideas offered in the text. This sometimes made reading the readings feel a little bit pointless, since we would hardly get through them in class. If Professor Savci could create a clear road-map and leading questions, I think the class would be a lot more enjoyable than it currently is. I also thought that the class could be more challenging in discussions, and Professor Savci could've pushed students to think harder to think about the concepts offered up by the very rich syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teacher is phenomenal- so intelligent, approachable, and well-versed in this area of literature. I felt extremely comfortable talking in the class about hard-to-navigate subjects and always found myself looking forward to our discussions. The readings selected were also INCREDIBLE and so interesting. I was legitimately excited to do the homework and take notes. It never felt like a waste of time.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Towards the end, it was noticeable that people stopped doing the readings, so our discussions grew weaker and Professor Savci began speaking more than before. She might need to re-think how to run class discussions when this happens to keep people more engaged/be a bit tougher on making sure reading gets done. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were very engaging. There could perhaps be a way to tie in even more contemporary aspects, such as ten minute discussion of a news story that week, or short video clip etc. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the professor. She is amazing and very good at explaining the course material and picking activities/ assignments that lend themselves to further developing the transnational skill set. "

            "\u00a0YES! EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE A CLASS WITH EVREN! If you are new to WGSS, this is a great place to start! Do yourself a favor and take this class, seriously. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in the subject. There is great opportunity and guidance to learn. At the same time if you dont care you can easily skate by without learning much at all. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Firstly, I believe that EVERYONE should take at least one course in transnational approaches to theory because I have never more strongly believed that this is a crucial foundation towards research and global analysis. Secondly, I think taking a class with Profesor Savci is a particularly special experience- I plan on following her to her other classes...she is that good. She is so warm, so strong, and so intelligent in how she runs discussion. I think Yale needs to tenure her ASAP. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I feel like it offers an important perspective. The kind of reading assigned in this class is unlike any other that I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in the interactions between nation states within our transnational world and aspects of gender and sexuality complexities within such a context. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I believe they do have to have some sort of preexisting inclination in WGSS to be fully engaged and appreciative of the course material but if they are, it is a definite yes. "
