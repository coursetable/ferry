It has a very strong biological focus, so you also end up knowing more about some of the disease mechanisms like HIV, HCV. ",

            "\u00a0I feel that the pressure of participation wasn't as effective in facilitating discussion. I feel that there would be more effective ways to demonstrate one's level of understanding of the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Having speakers from industry really gives a unique view on certain topics that could not have been obtained otherwise. Oftentimes, the student participation felt quite forced, so I did not really like this part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0If people did not read the articles, it can make the discussion aspect of the course a little more challenging. Also, forcing the class to go around in a circle to answer questions instead of allowing students that have insightful responses to answer the questions, I feel that my education was hindered for the sake of Class Participation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of primary literature, fantastic guest speakers, a very applicable and interesting course.\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally there were too many papers assigned for a single week (I think 3-4 is ideal, 5+ is too many to really understand). I thought an unnecessary emphasis was placed on everybody in class participating, frequently students were put on the spot to answer questions about topics they had no experience with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  good selection of papers, great guest speakers, accessible professors, manageable workload.  Weaknesses:  wasn't as much of a discussion seminar as it was quizzing people on the papers, majority of class time seemed like it was spent evaluating students instead of learning anything. ",

            "\u00a0The topics each week were all well thought out and interesting. Guest lecturers (who all work in industry) gave extremely interesting insights into the drug development process. However, the professors tend to cold call on students to answer questions about very tiny details in the papers we read every week, which made the class quite stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the courses subject matter was interesting, but the seminar format and requirement for every to participate in a discussion often times forced questions that required little digestion and thought over the material being presented.  Often times the questions being asked in class would have been more appropriately asked on a reading quiz rather than in front of the entire class.  Regurgitation of what is stated in the paper is not a discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the variety of topics, but I'm not sure having students present them is the most effective way to facilitate learning the material. I like that it felt like a discussion, though. ",
            "\u00a0student lectures are not good ",
            "\u00a0The topics discussed in this seminar were all  very interesting! I think one weakness of the course was low level of engagement from students. The topics while interesting were seemingly daunting for someone with minimal background in chemical biology. Maybe a brief background/introduction of the topic given by the instructors would have increased participation in the following student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a little demanding for those who haven't taken chemical biology before since it requires you to have some basic knowledge about it. If this course could spend some more time talking about some necessary basic facts it could be more helpful "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think this class is excellent for anyone who plans to do chemistry or biology and work in topics related to health. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I'd recommend it.  Its a bit of a weird class, so keep that in mind.  Its a seminar with a heavy amount of class participation factored into the grade, but dont expect too much actual discussion about the field - its basically just reading papers before class and then having presenters cold call students to recite the details.  Both professors are great resources though, and the critical analysis of the literature combined with the really insightful guest lecturers make this course worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class - it's really fun and you learn a lot from the scientific papers that the professors assign every week. It also trains you to read the papers in a very detailed manner, and critically consider their methodology and results. ",
