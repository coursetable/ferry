            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper knowledge of ways of reading. Coming into this course, my experience in high school and in Yale English classes taught me there was only one acceptable method of reading for theory and fiction -- the kind of close reading we are taught over and over. Professor Homans builds on close reading and shows how many other ways of reading exist, especially ways that center feminist and queer perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Various methodologies of queer, feminism, and gender theory for literary analysis. Emphasis on close-reading and tightly written essays. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths are the reading list, the reasonable and productive writing assignments, and Professor Homans expertise and attentive, generous feedback. The dynamic of class discussion was weird this year, maybe less because of Professor Homans and more because people engaged with the class at really different levels. ",
            "\u00a0While there was a heavy amount of reading at the beginning of the course, Professor Homans was responsive to student feedback and modulated the amount. One of the weaknesses of the course was that sometimes it was clear to me that people hadn't done the reading, but Professor Homans would think the lack of response to her questions was because her question had been unclear. (It wasn't! Her questions are great!) Professor Homans did sometimes structure homework assignments so students could choose which theoretical piece they were responsible for glossing in class, which was really helpful in terms of encouraging participation and making sure we all got what we needed to out of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a real and committed emphasis to frameworks that are traditionally left out of feminist and queer (I.e. trans studies, queer of color scholarship) \r\nWeaknesses: I think the reading load was a bit too heavy, making it hard for everyone to be fully engaged with the texts. Less theory would be helpful, I think. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Homans facilitates a wonderful and productive seminar discussion. She really values every student's comments and is sure to echo what they say and incorporate it into discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. I particularly enjoyed taking it at the end of my time as an English major, because it allowed me to read criticism in a way I hadnt before in the major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great texts, great professor. Will change how you think about reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you like theory, take it. If not, perhaps a pure literature rather than methods course would be better suited. Prof. Homans is great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, not just for English and WGSS majors, but everyone! The course is reading-heavy, but the material isn't as dense as one would expect. "
