            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about the Inca's political organization, architecture, and material culture. Favorite topics included the mystery of narrative quipus, inca metallurgy, and the socialist view of the Incan state. The course surveyed different major archaeologists' approaches to Incan archaeology and studied the incan artifacts in Yale's museums. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough knowledge of the Inca State, from its architecture to its culture to its downfall.\r\n\r\nEqually interesting, and given an equal amount of class time, is the history of archaeology and ethnography on the Inca, from the first scholars of Inca studies to contemporary developments in the field. There are a lot of politics, all of which are fascinating to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Inca/Andean culture and how to approach reading archaeological papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduces students to historical and archaeological methods that have been used to understand the Inca Empire from its formation until colonization, as well as Spanish rule and resistance to it throughout the colonial period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the Inca empire and its history and how its society functioned through reading archaeological papers and films. I developed a more nuanced look at the Inca Empire and how different perspectives about the empire exist based on the relationship the Incas had with other peoples during their reign. "

            "\u00a0Heavy reading composed of many sources of varying importance divided among students to present on in class. This didnt always work well because students only read the pieces assigned and presentations weren't comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0The class had an excellent set of readings, as well as engaging lectures and discussions. Prof. Burger is fantastic and really fun to listen to, and has a lot of experience in the field.\r\n\r\nOnly thing I can think of is additional visual aids, but thats it! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this class does not have a lot of coursework and class is a welcoming environment. One can definitely take this class if you have no prior knowledge on the subject. \r\nThe weaknesses are that the papers are sometimes confusing to read and that the mini-essay and the midterm were due on the same date. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar structure facilitated conversation and the asking of questions, but class was often taught in a lecture style because Professor Burger needed to convey seemingly endless, very detailed information that was historical, archaeological, and anthropological. Burger did bring in materials and showed images throughout the course, but it would have helped to have them shown as they were taught, rather than a few classes later. This did not take away from how engaging the course was. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a seminar style format, with students required to read selected readings and present them to the rest of the class for discussion. This allowed us to hear from each student and discuss the paper with them and the professor and TF. Also, the use of documentary films and pictures allowed us to put images to the stuff we were reading about, especially when talking about architecture and cultural materials. Not everything was read and discussed in class, so it might be beneficial to the class if there was a revision of the syllabus to focus on the topics we gave more attention to. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Incas were an ethnically and ecologically diverse empire of dynamic rulership and complex culture. they are a great empire to study from any perspective--economic, social, gender, colonial, art--and I had a great time in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. People should know about the empires and cultures of the Pre-Hispanic Americas. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I'd reccomend this course. It's very interesting, very manageable, and one doesn't need prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in anthropology or archaeology. Because this course focuses on Andean archaeology during the Inca Empire, having an interest in Andean or Inca culture would also make the class more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is important to understand the existence of not just the Incas but other native peoples on South America before the arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese. More so, this class gives us an appreciation of the archaeology and the fact that many of these structures and remnants of the Incas still exist, thus we should protect them and be wary of attempts to profit off of them and false narratives.
