            "\u00a0I gained deeper insight to the application of statistics. I also believe I developed a strong understanding of the calculus behind the statistics that I learned. \r\n\r\nI believe that the programming was taught in an easy to understand manner. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who had never taken calculus before, I think Lloyd is an incredible professor.  I don't think anyone could have helped us learn like he did.  I wish we had more time with Stata.  The calculus helped in econ, but I think learning calculus in tandem with applying it in the econ class was over ambitious. ",

            "\u00a0The course focused on  derivatives, some probability, regressions, and how to use Stata. What I enjoyed most was learning about the subjective nature of statistical analysis and how biases impact quantitative work. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great! A wonderful refresher of calc (with concepts explained in a way that actually made them make sense for the first time). I also feel like I got a decent beginners intro to STATA, which I plan to continue building on. The greatest strength was Lloyd - a fantastic teacher who was so committed to the students. We worked hard to learn because he worked hard to teach! ",

            "\u00a0This course was excellent at drawing a clear line between the discipline of calculus and the art of statistical modeling, particularly with its focus on the application of both skill sets to relevant, current issues in social science.  The capstone project was an outstanding and engaging final assessment of my ability to apply the tools and intuitions I'd developed over the course of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is really well organized and Lloyd is an extremely thoughtful and intentional professor. \r\nWeaknesses: The course can be somewhat unrelated to Global Affairs at times. The final project brings it back in focus, but it does seem to drift away from the study of Global Affairs during the bulk of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lloyd is a wonderful instructor. He makes sure to go over each step carefully and methodically. The level of preparation Lloyd shows in this class is simply impressive and many aspects of the class serve as a testament to his desire to see everyone really understand the material and succeed (regardless of their comfort level with quantitative analysis). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I understand that everyone comes into Jackson with differing levels of math/calculus proficiency, but I did feel that the first half of the class moved a little bit too slowly/many of the calculus concepts were not that necessary to begin analyzing basic level statistics. Alas, if you are mindful of the fact that this is more of a breadth course rather than a depth course, its fine. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like some of the programming parts of the course were difficult to understand and engage with. I would have appreciated if we could code alongside Lloyd to better understand the process. ",
            "\u00a0We've talked about this a lot amongst ourselves as students.   It seems to us that Lloyd loves teaching this material - so much so that he has designed a course that he wants to teach (not necessarily the course that would be of greatest use to us).  He consistently told us that we were going deep into the material because understanding the background of what Stata is doing is important.  But to be honest, virtually none of us in the program are going to be taking derivatives any time in our careers.  Spending two thirds of the class on calculus and only one third on research design and Stata is not a good combination for what we need professionally.  He says he was saving us time by not making us take a math camp over the summer, but I would have much rather been told I needed to learn calculus over the summer so that we could have spent the whole semester working in Stata and finding relationships in the data.  I had no idea calculus was going to be part of this class or the econ class, and I would have had a very different semester had I known how crucial it was to come into this program with a background in calculus. One other thing - Lloyd consistently went 10-15 minutes over at the end of class every day.  One student said he told them it's because in previous semesters the class was 1h30min, not 1h15min, and he has to cover the same amount of material.  When we only have short breaks between our classes, this doesn't work.  The material needs to be shortened.  Lloyd is an amazing teacher and a very compassionate human being, and I wouldn't trade him for a different instructor, but the course could benefit from a little restructuring. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor who really cares. It did not make me love stats, as some said it would. I think part of the reason that is so is that I did not think the course used data sets relevant to broader societal variables (beyond age and income). More interesting data sets would be good for this class. Also at the beginning, problem sets were not only long, but cumbersome. Half of the length would have been appropriate. Love Lloyd though - hes smart, energetic, and caring. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and classes were easy to follow. A little less time spent on the math part and more time on Stata could have been a better balance. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it takes students with little background in statistics and mathematics and gives us an understanding of descriptive statistics and multivariate calculus.  It also gives us the skills in Stata to be able to answer questions relating to datasets. ",
            "\u00a0I wish more time will be allocated to Stata teaching and reduce the algebra teaching in the first two weeks of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lloyd is a great teacher and his class notes and teaching in class plus officer hours was incredibly helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of homework! But I guess it helped ",
            "\u00a0Once we started working in STATA the course was less engaging, although I'm not sure how this can be improved as it seems to be inevitable given the nature of working in a programming language. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were good practice to gain skills taught in class. Course materials were well organized and could easily be found on canvas. It's really difficult, but more engaging ways should be found to teach stata in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a strong basis in calculus but kind of glossed over probability. It seems like a more balanced approach could be taken. I for one would have been willing to show up for math camp in the early summer. It may have been a bit painful but it also would have been a chance for the class to bond. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Everything, especially Lloyd's teaching.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, none. ",
            "\u00a0A math camp would have helped bring students on an equal footing with one another. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: painstaking breakdown of source material from the instructor--I haven't touched hard math skills in approximately 12 years, and Professor Grieger structured his classes, notes, and problem sets in such a way as to provide the density / repetitions I needed to regain proficiency in these skills, without making it fatal if I struggled in a particular area for some time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We went into great depth with calculus skills, but the programming skills required for the statistical modules felt comparatively rushed. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Devise a way for students to participate in the statistical classes with their computers so that they are programming in real time; some problem sets were difficult because they were not directly linked to the same skills we'd learned in class (different data sets, different methods of coding). ",
            "\u00a0This was taught very well- I thought we covered the material quickly but fairly thoroughly and I appreciated the emphasis on problem sets, as practice makes perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Very thorough, and well taught, section on calculus. Less engaging, and more difficult to follow section on STATA. Did not find this later section very useful or engaging. Not sure how much use a mandatory STATA course is. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, mostly because Lloyd is a great instructor. This could be a great introduction to quantitative analysis for those planning a career in non-research-based international development field.\r\n\r\nThis course is a requirement for Jackson MA students, so I am not sure whether recommend is the right word. The course does its job very well. ",
            "\u00a0If there was an option to choose between this class and a research design/Stata class, I would choose the latter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - the teacher is pedagogically very strong and the course well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Prof Grieger is an excellent teacher and has put significant thought into how to teach this course.  It is well taught and you will learn the basic skills necessary to analyse human survey data sets. The class goes at a pace that allows everyone to learn the material. This course is quite different from the biological statistics courses I have taken in the past - this is not the course to take if biology is your area of interest. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, great intro to statistics, taught in a practical and usable way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it helps you gain greater facility with analyzing and working with data. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not only considering what a specialized course it is within the program, with the math component covering both this and econ. But if someone needed that I certainly would. ",
            "\u00a0This is a required course. If a student has to take a statistics course, Lloyd is an excellent professor to take statistics with! As mentioned elsewhere, my preference would be for more focus on research design and applying statistics to explore research questions. That said, I learned a lot from this course and thought it was well designed and executed to meet the course objectives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend the course for anyone looking for a basic analytic methods course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great class to brush up and learn from scratch! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0100% and then some.  The cross-disciplinary design of this class (not just hard math, but math tailored to solving relevant problems in social policy) is precisely what I expected to be doing as a graduate student. ",
            "\u00a0I would to students that haven't taken math in a while, as Lloyd was excellent. "
