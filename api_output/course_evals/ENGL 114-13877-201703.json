            "\u00a0I learned about what academic writing is. I learned how to read material that is at a very high level. I also learned how to write a research paper and how to defend my writing style. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about having clear and concise writing that gets to the point logically and has a good flow throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of experience reading and analyzing dense academic texts, particularly in the fields of sociology and anthropology. I also improved my writing skills with feedback from peers and the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0This is an introductory course that teaches the writing skills you need for college-level writing. In addition, you get to do amazing readings that pertain to your section topic and also readings on how to write. ",
            "\u00a0This coursed drastically improved my ability to write concisely and effectively. It taught me how to think critically about each paragraph, sentence, and word I write. It showed me what technical aspects of writing make an argument effective or ineffective, and how to distinguish between elements of an argument. All in all, the course taught me how to think strategically when I write. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to structure a strong argument, read carefully, and access Yale writing resources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of academic writing conventions, tone, and style. I also learned how to write a research paper for a humanities class, which will be helpful in future classes. The greatest skill I took away from this course was concision in writing, which my professor highly emphasized. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was a decent introduction to what college writing courses are like, but I did not enjoy it. I would write my rough draft just for it to be torn apart so that I could re-write it entirely for the final draft. I didn't feel like I was learning how to improve my writing, just being told how awful it was. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful in giving my an opportunity to improve my academic writing skills. It would have been helpful for me personally to have spent more time explaining the different requirements of academic writing in different fields. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a must-take. Coming in, I was not confident in my writing abilities at all. This course teaches you the basics of how to write in a systematic way, which I think is helpful for someone that doesn't have a good foundation in writing. In addition, the readings were extremely interesting. I think even people who think they are good writers should take this course; you really learn to not only write clearly but think clearly as well. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the range of academic essays/writing we explored throughout the term. It was helpful to see a variety of writing strategies and styles. Another good part of the class was the rough draft, final draft process. I think most of my improvement came through critique \r\nI can't recall any glaring weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are that it is taught well and is engaging due to interesting reading material. A weakness is that the expectations can be high for incoming students, but provided me with an opportunity for growth. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the structure of this class--I felt like the first two essays were approachable, the third essay was challenging, and the fourth essay was a nice light piece for the end of the semester. The readings were excellent and an appropriate level of work to complete. I liked the small size of the class because some of my other classes were large lectures and the nature of 114 lends it very well to small group discussion. "

            "\u00a0Maybe different sections of 114 are better, but overall I've heard English 120 is overall more beneficial. Take that if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it's a great introduction to college writing. ",
            "\u00a0The main draw of this course is the opportunity to practice writing with regular feedback from peers and the instructor. There were also lively and intellectual in-class debates about the readings that I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take it. For the benefit of all the papers you will ever write. Just do it. Even if you think you're too good for this intro writing class, you'll learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think it's important that every student regardless of discipline learns how to structure an argument in writing. Concision and effective writing is useful anywhere. And this class showed me how to fine-tune my writing in ways I never really thought of. I don't think this is true for every ENGL 114 section. I credit a lot of this course's success to the instructor, Seo Hee. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because I was able to learn about a topic that was unfamiliar to me and to grow as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 114 is a good class to develop your academic writing skills before taking other humanities classes at Yale. My only caveat is that the class was more focused on writing in general than it was on the theme of \"Stress and Progress\" so I would have liked that to be emphasized in the course description. "
