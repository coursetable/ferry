            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to formulate a strong argument in a variety of approaches, from research papers to op-eds. We also learned about several theorists like Rousseau and Freud and how these thinkers continue to contribute toward society's outlook today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what constitutes a college paper and strategies to help me write more effectively and efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I improved my writing because of this course. I also was able to develop a proper form of developing ideas for use within an essay ",
            "\u00a0I gained a familiarity with the ideas and works of some famous \"social doctors\" including Rousseau, Weber, and Freud. I also developed a better understanding of specific societal ills, including the opioid crisis and cyberbullying, and learned how to better write a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I developed how to write an academic paper that can make a convincing argument and back it up with evidence.  I learned how to organize the content of the paper and how arguments are crafted with warrants, evidence, and ideas.  I learned how to gather sources and research for a large and intensive research paper which will help me in the future.  I also saw how hunches and feelings can be refined into an academic paper and how one should present themselves in an academic field. "

            "\u00a0There was a lot of really difficult, ambiguous reading in the beginning but it began to even out and become enjoyable. Great class dynamic, excellent professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include a fascinating topic, well planned syllabus and highly organized class time. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like it was slightly rushed including 4 essays in the course. We could not give each unit enough time. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the strengths of the course were the discussions and the fundamental aspects of writing an academic paper.  Reading and dissecting other essays from people we read in class was especially helpful as well as peer review.  I thought that there was a lot of flexibility and encouragement of original thought in the papers which was nice to gain confidence writing. "

            "\u00a0If you want to experience deep thinking and be able to view our society through several different lenses in order to clearly evaluate its overall \"health\", and want to see where systemic faults lie, all while improving your writing, then take this course. The interactions between students and professor were enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was by far my favorite course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that you would take this course if you have some writing experience but try another course if you don't have a lot of experience ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The topic was very interesting; we had countless great, thought-provoking discussing during class and I always felt very engaged. This was also an extremely useful class to learn how to properly write a college-level paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the topics covered are interesting and give the student flexibility in what he/she can write about.  The readings, if they were difficult, were broken down in class discussions by other students of the professor.  You also learn how to write in a cohesive and convincing way. "
