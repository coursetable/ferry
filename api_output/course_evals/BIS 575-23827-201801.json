            "\u00a0I think this course's main weakness is its lack of structure. There does not seem to be any overarching organization. The guest speakers were interesting, but I think they also contributed to this feeling of not knowing the key takeaways of the course. ",

            "\u00a0This course is excellent. Kind Professor, well designed class, evenly distributed workload every week, easy exams. I really think it's worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Makuch evidently knows the subject matter in great detail as he formerly worked as a special government employee at the FDA. However, the course was at times difficult to digest and could have been presented differently - sometimes it felt like it was all over the place. I came out not really understanding where someone in public health could work in regulatory affairs - even though the professor mentioned several times how possible that was. I am really interested in the topic but unfortunately was a bit disappointed in the course. The subject matter was interesting but the use of several guest speakers didn't seem warranted. \r\n\r\nIt might be improved if the material was presented differently. The course text was also outdated and the inclusion of more current events/articles to prepare for class would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a comprehensive intro to regulatory affairs. But it depends on students on interests a lot. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- a very practical course that teaches you the in's and out's of drug development and approval. The speakers were all great and brought real-world examples to the classroom. \r\n\r\nWeakenesses- a little unorganized with course materials ",
            "\u00a0Good overall introduction to the regulatory field. I liked that the course not only focused on the US, but also the respective regulatory bodies in the EU and Asia. I would've liked course materials (powerpoints, homework solutions, and important announcements) to have been released in a more timely manner though. The last month of class was all guest speakers, which was a good illustration of how class material relates to current industry. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Messy lecture notes. The professor did not care about teaching. Professor Makuch should really spend some time to correct the typos and improve the structure of the lecture notes and slides. ",
            "\u00a0This class was pretty poor. The highlight of this class is the guest speakers that came to talk about their work in the industry. Some of these speakers lead a class that actually taught us a concept, but many just shared their experiences through stories. Both were valuable. When the professor taught, he more or less lectured off the slides, intermittently throwing in stories that seem helpful and interesting at first, until you realize that he doesn't quite know the details of different things he's mentioning. I think his knowledge base is pretty limited and the greatest benefit of taking this class is perhaps the knowledge he has about some of the opportunities in the field and his connections. "

Though it is good information to have in general and understanding how the FDA works is vital to public health practitioners, a career in regulatory affairs is likely going to be for someone with scientific background and/or biostatistics. It doesn't seem like there is much of a place for others in this career path. The course includes several guest speakers who were very informative but ultimately the information could have been presented much differently/ more systematically. ",
