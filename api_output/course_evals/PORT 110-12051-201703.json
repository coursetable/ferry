            "\u00a0I learned a great deal of Portuguese, which was a pleasant surprise considering that this was only L1 ",
            "\u00a0At the end of this class you will have developed significant speaking and listening ability. You will be able to understand spoken portuguese at a rudimentary level and you will have a strong grasp of the grammatical and syntactic aspects of the language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to formulate well organized sentences in my first foreign language quickly in the first few weeks of the course. I also reinforced my skills in working with others as a group and public speaking in a foreign language. "

            "\u00a0The Portuguese department excels at having incredibly energetic and engaging instructors. The text could be improved and made more lively and user friendly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the small class size which allows students to be more engaged with the instructor; the opportunities for office hours also are very convenient for extra tutoring. The instructors effort in ensuring that the students have the materials necessary to complete homework is also a strength. No real weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Intro Portuguese is without a doubt the most fun class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course may seem intimidating at first but it is very well organized with a textbook that facilitates learning in clear ways. The instructors usage of the Portuguese language from the beginning of the semester may make one feel uncomfortable and unlikely to continue the class, but grasping the language and executing it well comes quickly due to the great instructor.
