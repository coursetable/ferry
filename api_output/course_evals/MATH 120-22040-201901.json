In terms of weaknesses, the course was somewhat poorly organized; the biggest weakness by far was the drastic difference in teaching styles between the different instructors. To be frank, nearly everyone who takes this course knows that, if they are not fortunate enough to be assigned a certain instructor over another, they will have to work twice as hard over the course of the semester in order to understand the same material simply because it is not taught as well/clearly.
