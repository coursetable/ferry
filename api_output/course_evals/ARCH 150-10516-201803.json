            "\u00a0Architecture courses are great at Yale because it gets you looking at New Haven in a whole new way. ARCH 150 made me notice subtle architectural marvels and it made me really think about our relationship with buildings. The assignments were great, I could really exercise creativity and experiment with mediums and methods. By the end of the course, I think I've developed better observation skills, better sketching ability, and better design methods, as well as learned to think outside the box. ",
            "\u00a0I got a better understanding of architecture in all its forms. We covered everything from architectural design, to theory, to urban planning. The weekly assignments tested my drawing abilities but also caused me to notice details in the things around me that I hadn't noticed before. ",

My drawing definitely improved a lot and I just learned very interesting stuff about the world of architecture. I feel like now I can walk around cities and places and be able to truly appreciate the buildings in detail. ",

These were reinforced by weekly assignments, being mostly drawing as well as model building and writing. \r\n\r\nMy capacity to understand architecture and its affect on and relation to humans developed greatly. My drawing skills also improved. ",

Each week focuses on a different element of architecture like materials or form, and the lecture goes over many examples in which the professor explains how the element is expressed. I also learned some very very very basic technician skills in regards to drawing architecture. I think you get what you put in for this class. Its easy to slack off and spend 10 minutes on each assignment, or you could spend hours. If you want to take away concrete knowledge and skills, this class also isnt for you. Youll more have a general understanding and appreciation of architecture. I am not an architecture major, but the course is designed so its very accessible to anyone even if you have 0 drawing skills. ",

I also learned a ton about architectural thinking, theory, history, and works. But really, since this is just an intro course, I think the most important thing that a student can gain from it is a love for architecture and an interest in learning more. I was really undecided coming into this semester, but this class convinced me that I want to major in the Architecture! ",

I also greatly improved my drawing ability, as weekly assignments and note-taking were primarily drawing, ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introductory course to the design principles behind architecture. You learn the basics about form, material, space, shape, etc. More than anything, this course encourages you to be an active observer of the spaces around you. I would say that this course teaches you less about what is \"good\" or \"bad\" architecture and more about observing and understanding why buildings were built the way they were. I also improved my sketching skills through the drawing assignments. ",

            "\u00a0Intro to architecture provided me with the skill of seeing. This course is about learning how to see light, materiality, and space. I truly improved my drawing skills, having come in with basic perspectival drawing skills, I learned how to express architecture in more ways. Among such representations was section, axonometric, and plan. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about what it means to have a labor of love. The workload is heavy, and more so if you want to stand out. But, in my opinion, it is also extremely fun and satisfying. This course taught me that sometimes to excel you have to be willing to put in an ungodly amount of work.\r\n\r\nIt taught me what creativity really looks like. It is more than simply doing the assignment. It is taking risks with the assignment. Not just putting in a lot of work -- but being comfortable with simple, yet striking, ideas. Having the courage to think your work is interesting when your instructors don't. Letting go of fear so you can feel safe enough to try many things -- some of which might be great, and most of which will probably fail. Trusting your gut. All things which are cliche, but which I didn't necessarily *deeply* understand until I took this course. Now I do. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were productive & interesting & all the assignments were the perfectly challenging. My TAs were supportive & helpful & made coming to section every week fun. The readings for the course were interesting, but not necessary for keeping up with the class. There  were also SO many to the point where it was difficult to read them being that you didn't have to. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a fantastic survey of architecture as a practice and as a tool for describing space. There could be more emphasis placed on what it means to be an architect and the day to day lives of architects. There could be a little more feedback, especially at the midterm, but I never felt frustrated with how I was doing in the class the emphasis was always placed on learning and improvement rather than grades, which was very comforting. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the focus on personal work, doing whatever drawing or thinking feels best do you is a great strength. I think to that point the course could have more concrete goals and feedback that students base their learning on. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: sections were engaging\r\nWeaknesses: feedback on assignments could be ambiguous at times ",
            "\u00a0i enjoyed the drawing assignments and most lectures (when i went... 9:25 on monday is hard), however it was not the most engaging class and its hard to motivate yourself to go to lecture ",
            "\u00a0I loved how the course was structured  I felt like I was learning a lot every week, and every lecture was genuinely interesting. I wish I could have gotten more feedback, but I think the midterm review sufficed. Although it was tough in section, because I was not a good artist, it was still a lot of fun looking at other peoples' drawings. I wish we had more \"office hours\" with our TAs, even when it was just a regular weekly assignment (as compared to a Design Problem). ",
            "\u00a0Had a very positive experience! Maybe could learn more about the actual techniques for our more hands on projects ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the weekly assignments, I thought they were interesting and fun to do. I think sometimes lectures were a little meandering and while they had general subjects, the lecture topics always felt broad which made the lectures sometimes feel less useful. Still a fun class and I did enjoy going to lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are fairly interesting but don't seem to relate so much to the drawing assignments given at section. The drawing assignments were also quite interesting and challenging. I really did not enjoy the lack of transparency when it came to grades. I have no idea how I did in the class and never was able to tell whether I needed to change anything in order to improve, as all comments were very ambiguous. It would have been very nice to see a more concrete grade at the midterm review. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures used the same buildings over and over, which could get repetitive. Also, there would be a hundred slides a lecture, so the material is spread thin. Purves is an amazing narrator though, and the ta led sections were great. ",
            "\u00a0The final project was not well organized in my opinion. The critique did not offer student participation and the critics spoke for about 4 hours without going in depth into any truly interesting concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths; great lecturer! His passion for the field really carries through. The weekly drawing assignments were also great, as it didnt feel like homework and was fun to do.\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the readings were very abstract, and I didnt end up doing many of them. We also didnt receive much guidance on the final project (which is the point); however itd be nice to know how we couldve improved it. You also dont know your grade at all during the semester. ",

            "\u00a0This course benefits very much from having been offered for many years - it is well structured to give the student a well-rounded and general overview of architecture. It was extremely accessible (and of course enjoyable) even someone who had no prior experience and simply wanted to explore a new field. The satisfaction and reward you gain in this class very much scales with the amount of work you put in it - it can be very low-workload or very time-consuming, depending on what you want to achieve through the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the professor - hes been teaching the class for a while and has worked out a good framework for communicating principles of architecture. The biggest downside is that you have no idea what your grade is in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting, but I wish the lectures could be incorporated into the assigments more than just the paper. The majority of the assignments in the class are drawing, and although the themes of the assigments fit that week's lecture, it is possible to complete the assigments without ever attending class. I also wish I would have a better since of what my grade was going to be throughout the semester. Even as I am filling out this survey right now, I have no idea what I am about to recieve. I know my TA's said good things about my drawings, but then again, they said good things about everyone's drawings, so I'm a little scared to say the least. ",

            "\u00a0This is a very good introductory architecture course, but you do feel extremely behind and inferior if you do not have any past architecture/drawing experience. Lectures and assigned readings almost seem unnecessary for the assignments but they are also interesting. TAs are super cool and helpful; they know a lot and give a lot of guidance if you want it (and sometimes even if you don't). ",
            "\u00a0This class is a wonderful intro. It is not high stress, but still provides a good overview of architecture as a discipline and a field of study. Professor Purves is a real strength -- he's a total gem. I found his lectures to be extremely engaging and meaningful. Our TA's were also all fantastic and really inspiring. Each section has two TA's, which I find really nice. The sketching assignment and design projects were quite fun and the paper was really interesting to write. The only weakness I would say is that some of the guest lecturers were not as good as Professor Purves. But not all of the guest lectures were bad -- I absolutely loved Trattie Davies's lecture on shapes! ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course is that the readings were not completely connected to the lectures and never discussed or gone back to, so I had little motivation to read them. Also, I received almost no constructive feedback on my sketchbook and design project, only specific positive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Every week, you attend section, which is led by two architecture grad students. Your weekly assignments are usually sketchbook drawing assignments, although there is one model-building midway through the semester as well as a group assignment that may or may not involve sketching. Section was generally helpful and feedback was almost always positive, but because of my limited sketching skills I felt like I was sometimes being critiqued on my drawing ability more than my ability to interpret form. I definitely felt limited by only being able to sketch; I wish there was an option to build models each week/more weeks instead of sketching. I definitely prefer working with my hands more, and if you don't want to sketch then this isn't the class for you.\r\n\r\nI think this class was great in that it really made you question your design choices and aesthetics. Why did you draw this building from this perspective in that way? Seeing other peoples' work in section was also very enlightening and interesting. Professor Purves is also a very good lecturer and I appreciated the diversity of his lecture topics as well as the numerous guest lecturers he brought in. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the lectures a lot, and the project assignments were very fun. I think the paper is not super necessary. I also wish the class was not at 9:25. I know that it may seem like college students should be able to wake up in time for the class, but I was somehow always 3 minutes late no matter how hard I tried to be on time. Professor Purves seemed kind of upset that many students arrived a few minutes late and I definitely felt guilty every time I walked in late, but I think the problem could be eliminated almost entirely if the class were at 11:35 or later. \r\n\r\nMy major critique of this class is that more women and people of color designers should be included both in lectures and on the reading list!!!!! I don't know much about architecture but I KNOW there have to be a few minority architects out there, but I really don't feel like we talked about any of them. I combed through the entire reading list and I could only find one single architecture-focused reading in the entire reading list and the reading list is freaking huge. It made me really disappointed as a woman of color interested in architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Guest lecturers were a great addition to Alec's lecturers, and also a great intro to the Architecture department. I hope to see more connection with readings in future courses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were in the section meetings. I truly learned the most from my TA's, David and Sam, and from the students that I met with once a week. The lectures were not as interesting, and seemed a bit rushed. We went through too many slides for me to be able to fully comprehend and appreciate a singular case. ",
            "\u00a0The readings need to be parsed down. On top of the weekly projects, they are too disparate, too long, and not focused enough to be worth spending time on. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were its accessibility to people with no background in Architecture and Its sketchbook assignments and sections were you got to engage in architectural critique and discussion. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were that: 1) the reading was not necessary to do and was not at all integrated into section or assignments. 2) The lectures became boring because we never got past surface level information about that days topic. 3) The guest lecturers were often very bad and presented little information or were problematic and defended gentrification. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course was the lecture, as they were brilliantly designed and delivered to cover a wide expanse of topics and keep students engaged. The drawing and design assignments were fun and thought-provoking, and reviewing the weekly assignments at section caused students to take them seriously. One weakness was the lack of emphasis on discussing the readings in lecture or section, such that students were not motivated to engage with the great literary resources. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of good info and allowed me to explore skills I hadnt had a chance to. This could be improved by making the course lectures more engaging. ",

            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Alex's lectures are a pleasure to sit through. The assignments are fun, and the overall workload is not bad. The final assignment (the lampshade, not the paper) really helps you grow as a designer and starts forging bonds with other potential architecture majors. This has been my favorite  class at Yale so far (definitely helped by the fact that I love my TAs) and though I had a really difficult time with the final project at first, it has turned out to be one of my favorite experiences at Yale.

I walk around now noticing so much more about the buildings (& world) around me than I ever did before. As someone not planning on majoring  in architecture, this course made me appreciate the profession & study so much more than I could have imagined. ",

Wonderful course for anyone of any major, great way to learn new and interesting ways of looking at things, for me (a deeply non-art, non-architecture, non-spatial person) it was a great way to stretch my brain and the ways I was able to think about the world. Engaging, interesting projects and material. The TAs were all phenomenal, available, knowledgeable, and critiqued you based on thought, effort, and creativity, rather than technical skill (phew). The kind of course where you tend to get what you put into it, but even if you don't put in all that much, what you get is still well worth it (though I'd recommend putting in as much as you can). Only two downsides: first, there's no numerical grading throughout the course whatsoever. You tend to have a sense of how well you're doing, though honestly who's to say (as we haven't received our finaland onlygrade). Second, there are a few guest lecturers scattered throughout who vary in quality. Since Purves is across the board wonderful, it's a bit annoying to hear from someone bland when you're used to hearing from him. Really not a major concern though. Overall, highly recommend. ",

This was possibly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, even though it wasn't for my major. I genuinely enjoyed every assignment, even if I wasn't the best artist, but the TAs were so nice and encouraging, and helped a lot. This is an amazing course with really interesting lectures, and it isn't a lot of work. ",

I didn't end up taking this until my senior year, but if I had taken it Sophomore year, I would certainly have taken more classes in architecture. The lectures are engaging, the projects fun, and the sections not nearly as intimidating as I first thought. The workload is pretty low because we never do anything with the readings, and the drawing assignments are a welcome break from the grind of problem sets and essays. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0yes, was a great class for non majors as well to think about structures around us ",
            "\u00a0I mean it's required if you want to major in Architecture, so you have to take it and it's really not too bad. Some days it might feel like you're not getting that much concrete knowledge out of it, especially from going to lectures, but overall it did improve one's comfortability and skill in design and sketching. TFs were accomodating and gave good feedback, but don't expect to like suddenly learn how to draw architecture or walk away with a really concrete understanding of the history of architecture. It's definitely an intro class, but overall it was pretty lowkey (although you do have to put time and effort in) and you do gain a footing for architecture in terms of knowledge and skill. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think the course is a great start for anyone whos remotely interested in architecture, even if you dont want to major in it. It leaves you with a better appreciation of the subject, and I love how Pruves incorporates many examples from Yale buildings so you can walk around campus and look at things differently. In terms of workload, attending lecture is a must as thats where you get the main takeaways of the class. There are not much readings, however theyre sometimes dense/abstract. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they want a better understand of architecture as an area of study ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, even if you have no prior experience in architecture. I am not a prospective major, but wanted to see what architecture was all about. I came out of the class with a deep appreciation for the field. I also definitely improved my drawing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class legitimately made me reconsider my major in a stem field and consider architecture. You learn about how architects think on a high level, and you will gain a much greater appreciation for all the beautiful buildings at Yale, among other places. Also, the sketchbook assignments are a really nice change of pace from psets. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has ever had an interest in architecture. As a non-architecture major, I found the first couple drawing assignments very intimidating, but I soon realized that there were a lot of other people in the same boat I was. I learned a lot and the content was always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- great overview and introduction to the fundamentals of architecture, especially for someone who didnt have much background in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are at all interested in drawing/architecture, this is a good class to take. I am a primarily social science type of person and I took it as my 5th class, and I'm glad I did. It was something different for me, challenged me, and was a good change of pace from my other work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0YES! I really learned a ton from this course. I came in unsure if I was really interested in Architecture, and I've left the class totally obsessed. I think the class is really wonderful, because as you go through it you can sort of delve into the material as deeply as you would like. You can spend as much or as little time as you would like on the drawing assignments and you aren't really expected to do any of the readings and. So if you want the workload can be really low, but I personally did almost all of the readings and found that they really underscored the lectures and made my course experience much richer. The lectures, themselves, are for the most part really lovely and engaging (except for a few guest lectures that could be hit or miss). Professor Purves is so excited about architecture and seems to really love teaching. I always found myself wondering where 50 minutes had gone at the end of lecture. Every week you have a drawing assignment of some sort, which are super fun -- its really nice to take a break from your regular coursework once a week to draw! Plus you really learn a lot about architecture through drawing it. And then at the end of the week you have sections, which are really nice, supportive environments to share your drawings and get to interact with two really cool TAs. One thing is that you don't really get any grades throughout the semester; you just find out you're grade after the class is over. So if you're someone who might stress about that, I may not recommend the class. However, I actually found it nice. I almost never thought about my grade during the class, and found that that helped me be much more focused on enjoying learning about architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure. Very interesting lectures and the assignments are cool. ",
            "\u00a0As a student not planning to go further into architecture, I would absolutely recommend it to other students in my position. I became fully submerged in a field completely unfamiliar to me, and the course got me thinking and seeing the world and structures around me in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student. You definitely don't need to have an artistic background to take the class. This course gives you an appreciation for the spaces around you and especially for Yale's beautiful and architecturally diverse campus. You will learn a lot, become more aware of your environment, get better at sketching, and have a low-workload but stimulating creative outlet through this class. Also, Professor Purves is wonderful and very kind, and the teaching staff are all very nice and accomplished in their own rights. The weekly workload is not bad. The final project will take a bit longer but also not terrible. Yes, take this class!! ",
            "\u00a0This class is great! Definitely take it if you like looking at buildings and/or want to improve your technical drawing skills. I didn't think my drawing skills would improve as much as they did and I'm really happy about it. If you take this class, definitely invest time in drawing and put a lot of effort into the projects. There isn't a ton of work for this class so it's really nice to have the freedom to get creative and be proud of what you create. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for an easy humanities class, it is a great choice. Naturally, a good opportunity to know more about both architecture and specifically the Yale program. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great introduction to architecture, both in theory, history, and actual practice! I appreciate that the course allows students to experience all three. It is also a wonderful introduction to much of the faculty of the School of Architecture-- very thoughtfully done. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially those who may want to take an architecture course but may not intend to major in architecture. It gave me a greater appreciation for the discipline and demystified some of the intellectual barriers that a presupposed. I would not recommend this course to a student who is very serious about practicing architecture, i.e. creating many structures and plans. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but I would make sure that the student enjoys drawing (and feels comfortable doing it) first! I enjoy drawing, but I felt like I didn't have the necessary skills to feel comfortable with the assignments for this class. We weren't really taught the skills we need to be able to draw well, per se,  just skills we need to draw in the context of architecture. This made the course particularly challenging for me. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in architecture, I would recommend taking this class. You won't necessarily walk away with the ability to identify buildings and those that designed them at the drop of a hat, but this class provides a more innate understanding of what makes for a compelling building and the fascinating ways in which architects balance form and function. The more laid-back grading really allows you to enjoy the experience of learning, and each of the lectures made me think about the structures that surround us everyday in a new way. You will be expected to draw, but don't let that scare you away - everyone comes in at different levels (there's no judgement) and leaves capable of capturing the essence of architectural drawing regardless of where you began. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about a relevant field and take an interesting course with not an unreasonable amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think anyone who is interested in architecture or is artistically inclined at all should take this course because it is a great survey course that is both incredibly interesting, and hands on in the application of concepts. "
