            "\u00a0I learned to think in more of a global politics framework when it comes to genocides and what tools are available to prevent atrocities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about landmark mass atrocities, international organizations, and political hurdles to action. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the global climate surrounding humanitarian crises. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge on the breadth of mass atrocities have been committed in the last century outside of the obvious ones like  the Holocaust/Rwanda.\r\nAn understanding of how international law views these atrocities and the politics behind naming them genocide\r\nA better understanding of the UN/UNSEC and their role in preventing atrocities\r\nSome insights on how these atrocities can be prevented in future and the difficulties in doing so. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much about genocide- the Powers book that grounds the course is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The class focused on international policy responses to mass atrocities. We started with how the term \"genocide\" came about and from there mostly looked at historical cases of mass atrocities (after the Holocaust though we did also touch on Armenia), how the international community responded, and how it could be better. Skill-wise you practice making a policy-brief and doing a simulation. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an astounding knowledge of genocide and the international laws pertaining to it. Truly an amazing seminar in that regard. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the history of genocides and mass atrocities and about the ways in which the international system has tried to address them. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of genocides throughout history as well as how the international community responds to them and subsequent effects. ",

            "\u00a0It seemed disorganized in terms of syllabus direction of the seminar content, and it would be better as a weekly seminar instead of meeting twice a week. The reason was for guest lectures' accommodation and the Rwanda video link: the video link didn't occur and the guest lectures were unnecessary and not always exciting to learn nor entirely crucial for the course content. Overall, it was interesting in its subject but the readings were not always discussed and too repetitive. It would be better if the readings were shortened. ",
            "\u00a0The GSP lectures were incredible and probably my highest point of engagement as many of the case studies were very dense. The courseload was fairly high due to meeting two times per week and needing to complete readings. The Syria simulation also improved student engagement. Sometimes it felt like the class got bogged down in the political complexity of each atrocity so that it was hard to back up and see the big picture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths : Short sharp lectures, engaging readings (albeit really long at the beginning of the semester), classes aren't one way talk shops and instead always involve discussions around readings/topic for that day. This keeps the class engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the Professor leads section very well. The weakness is that most other students did not do the reading, which was frustrating for moving along conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Content was really interesting, you get to learn about all sorts of cases of mass atrocities that you didn't even know existed. The Syria simulation was also a really interesting experience in taking the views of certain actors (also reveals just how hard international action is. The class also had a ton of guest speakers from the Genocide Studies program, some of which were really interesting (and it's always nice when they substitute for readings). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's little incentive to do the reading because Simon rarely refers to it, and much of each seminar consisted of a lecture-style summary of the mass atrocity (perhaps as a consequence of there being so many atrocities we cover). ",
            "\u00a0Really great course! Simon runs the seminar really well and the material is engaging if you're interested in genocide studies, international atrocity prevention, and the UN. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Simon is very knowledgable and I learned a lot but the course itself was not well-structured. ",
            "\u00a0Loved learning from Professor Simon and the other incredible guest speakers that he brought in.  Readings were well worth-while, but perhaps could have been addressed more directly in class.  Also, if there were slightly less readings I think it could help with the direction of discussions and engagement with the class (though the readings assigned were wonderful) ",
            "\u00a0great use of GSP seminars to supplement our regular sessions - we heard from a fascinating array of experts in the field ",
            "\u00a0I think the one way it could be improved is if we studied some sort of timeline of events at the beginning of the semester so that we were very clear on exactly when each genocide happened, etc. Sometimes the readings explained them well but sometimes I had to do a good amount of googling because the readings assumed I knew, and then the many events we looked at and the responses to them began to blur together.

            "\u00a0It is a good course for learning more about the challenges facing peacekeeping and limiting political violence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! Professor Simon is definitely an expert in the topics covered and the syllabus allows for deep engagement with historic events still shaping mass atrocity prevention today. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Prof. Simon is an amazing discussion leader. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! For those that either want to work in the area of atrocity prevention or for those from  'volatile' countries this course will help give you a better understanding about how atrocities are planned, executed and how they can be potentially prevented. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend, Professor Simon is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it though I wish the course had more assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would. Professor Simon has an expert grasp of the material and was always insightful while allowing students to challenge the conventional thinking on mass atrocities. The guest speakers and the simulations were great and helped us to approach the subject matter in practical ways. ",
            "\u00a0On the spectrum of free-for-all discussion on one side and full on lecture on the other, Simon definitely trends towards a lecture focused, more guided approach to seminar, so if that's your style definitely go for it, though if you tend to not like that in a seminar then you'll find it hard to be invested in this class. The content was really good, and I think essential to know for anyone thinking about a career in international affairs or diplomacy. Workload was also not too demanding, either. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really good seminar with interesting material. I also liked Simon's teaching style and appreciated that he really pushed back against points students would make and force us to explain ourselves and look at things from different points of view. He also gives helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must-take for anyone who is interested in genocide studies or intervention. Professor Simon is so invested in helping everyone learn the material and is super kind and easy to talk to. The level of interaction in the class was really awesome, I loved the guest speakers, simulation activity, and the level of participation. The final paper I wrote for this class was one of my favorites. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, this course's material could be learned from a book on mass atrocities like Samantha Power's A Problem from Hell, the course added nothing to merely reading that book. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in foreign service this class really helps you refine your regions of interest for future study and passions for a future career.  Do be warned that there are not a lot of success stories in genocide history so the material can get rather depressing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - though genocide may be a relatively rare occurrence, the dynamics affecting state willingness to cooperate under institutions like ICC or peacekeeping are worth studying because they shed some light on state cooperation in general "
