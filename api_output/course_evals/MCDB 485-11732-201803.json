            "\u00a0This senior research course has been very interesting and rewarding. I have appreciated the chance to work long-term on my thesis focusing more specifically on one biological process rather than many. For the first time, I am seeing the pieces of evidence that come together to make a scientific claim. I understand the pace and organization of a lab and setting up experimentation. The organization of evidence finding, analysis, then interpretation is something that I have been able to apply outside of the course as well. I find that this clear cut experimental approach is helping me with my public health research which is much less clear cut. ",
            "\u00a0You work in your lab so you'll be learning different things. You will write a proposal and grant proposal, which are good skills to have. ",
            "\u00a0Became a more independent and productive member of my lab--the value of this course and the senior research in general is very contingent on the quality of the lab that you are in and the mentorship that you are able to receive there. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt an awful lot in this semesters research - being independent, conducting own experiments and analysing results with software (which I previously had not done). ",
            "\u00a0Plasmid construction, assays, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and CRISPR methods ",
            "\u00a0Research skills in my lab. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work more in depth in a wet lab environment, thinking about the questions I want to pursue, what skills and techniques I need to learn, and to plan over the course of semester and a year to be able to accomplish these tasks. Also the grant proposal taught me what is required to write a grant proposal. ",
            "\u00a0Working in a research lab down at the med school, pretty cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of my research was on AV fistula, so I learned a lot about that and that Vascular system ",
            "\u00a0This was a senior requirement, and I think most insight and skills developed depend on your research mentor and principal investigator (PI). In my experience, I worked closely with my PI and he was very constructive and realistic in developing a good project for me. ",

            "\u00a0I am learning to apply many of the lab skills I have learned in my pre-med classes in real life. Not only am I understanding the experimental difficulties of research but also learning to navigate trouble-shooting when results don't turn out as planned. I am thankful to be in a lab that aligns with my interests and goals "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the ability to get a more hands-on experience in lab, see what it would be like to be a graduate student in biology and have your own project that you are working on. \r\nLimitations: It is VERY hard to be productive in lab if you are just beginning your senior year, or if you have never spent a summer/a period of time doing full-time research in your lab. MCDB does not require you to be in a lab before this class which I think is a significant weakness, as being in a lab and doing your own research is truly the culmination of the major and it is difficult for that to be meaningful without significant lab experience. PhDs take 5 years, so in one semester it is hard to feel like anything was accomplished. ",
            "\u00a0Different PIs have different requirements that seriously effect the long term joy students have while doing research. Also, some contact/feedback from the professors of the course would be nice - either at the beginning of the semester, or if they had office hours, or even if we just had an initial meeting where we had a chance to meet them.

            "\u00a0I think this course really depends on the PI that you are working with. I mostly worked with a mentor, assistant research scientist, in the lab, who was very helpful throughout and I maintain a great relationship. It helped me really connect with the people in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0The model doesn't necessarily lend to equitable situations-- thankfully I have a great mentor and PI who would be responsive to questions and help  with reports/proposals. Not everyone might have this luxury. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is well-structured to meet the demands of many MCDB majors finishing their senior requirement. The information/syllabus given was helpful, but I think the difference between the initial proposal and the final proposal could be better--as in, there would be better development. However, I understand that not much progress can be obtained in 2-3 months depending on the project and student schedule, so this is understandable. ",

            "\u00a0There should be more face-to-face between seniors and the MCDB 485 course instructors. There should be weekly drop-in hours in which students can come by to ask questions about the course, research methods, etc. \r\n\r\nStudents work in different labs and interact with the PI differently, so having a consistent instructor to meet with is important.
