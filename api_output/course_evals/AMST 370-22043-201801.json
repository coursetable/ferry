            "\u00a0I loved analyzing physical works as opposed to text. This class taught be how to be creative as well as analytical/logical. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of major 20th-century dancers, choreographers, and choreography and improved my writing skills. A lot of this information presented in the class was new to me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better articulate and describe dance through writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze different styles of dance to see both what separates them and how they're connected and feed into each other, now and over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze and write effectively about dance and performance. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved dramatically by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about the history of America's prominent dance techniques and choreographers. Additionally, I feel as if I learned much about creative and critical writing, and honed my ability to use precise language to make a clear and strong point. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of dance and gained a lot of insight into the figures that have shaped dance today. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the physical classes where we actually got to dance. I also loved the weekly routine- we just watched dances and discussed them. Such an ideal Monday afternoon, I truly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated that we went through edits to written exercises in class and discussed improvements - these sessions really helped me pinpoint areas for improvement. Seibert was very passionate about the material and I enjoyed class discussions. The sessions led by dancers were also fantastic, as I could better appreciate the thought and skill behind dance. I wish that the scans of the readings were higher quality though - they could be hard to read. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the way Brian encourages us to be to be specific with our language. Unfortunately I did not learn much dance history, but I did enter the course with a strong background. ",
            "\u00a0The course focuses on how to improve writing, so it feels like there are tangible ways to improve as the weeks go on. The different styles of dance that we touch on are interesting, and some of the videos are rarely accessible beyond Yale, so it's great to be exposed to so much dance that isn't able to be seen elsewhere. The guest lectures are also really cool because you get to dance with people who have worked with the choreographers we study and you can actually feel the techniques we try to discuss academically in your body. There is a lot of material assigned every week, though, so it's often difficult to prepare for lecture discussion without spending hours watching videos and reading texts. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course could have been more focused on the history of dance as opposed to critiquing dance. It was misleading when I initially enrolled in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The individual class sessions were interesting, but there wasn't always a clear through line of the course. I wish we'd spent less time discussing videos in class and more time either on our feet or talking more in depth about the history and context of the dances. It's also a long block of time, so I wish we'd broken up discussions with either a break or a change of topic in the middle. ",
            "\u00a0The things we did in class barely did anything to actually help with writing skills, we just watched videos. Totally unhelpful and dont take this if you actually want to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great combination of reading in one's own time, gaining historical context, watching videos, getting a more precise feel for the dancing of interested, in-class discussion, improving one's ability to articulate their opinions and often providing a new perspective, and learning the dances themselves. The time spent actually standing up and dancing was very valuable, and each of the guest teachers who came really added a lot to the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of providing an overview of the history of dance. The writing component was extremely difficult and was hard to grasp what Professor Seibert really wanted the writing to look like. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely but you have to be interested in dance and willing to mentally/physically get into it! ",
            "\u00a0I have never taken a dance history class before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. History of Dance changes with the professor and given his background, Professor Seibert probably focused more on writing technique than previous professors. I definitely saw my writing improve over the course of the class and enjoyed the writing exercises. I would recommend this class to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend to anyone who wants to dissect dance with people who care. It is very much a writing credit (we're writing every other week on average in addition to the final paper). That being said, the professor tries to emphasize ways to improve your writing and dance is just something really interesting to write about. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student with this professor. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING CLASS!!! Must take!! Brian is an amazing professor, and he really lets you explore any interpretation and relationship with dance. Even if you have no dance experience or if you are a professional, youll have a great time and learn a lot of history. The workload is manageable and Brian gives great feedback and help so that you steadily improve. Great class, great prof, great time overall! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The workload is low in terms of page count, but he expects a lot of care in the assignments so it balances out well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not, dont waste your time ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all interested in dance or the performing arts more generally. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think I would if they were prepared to try out a very different style of writing. "
