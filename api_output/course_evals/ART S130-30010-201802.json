            "\u00a0I have been painting for over 50 years.  My reason for taking this basic painting course is that I never finished art school so I don't have a degree.  The basic lessons I already knew, however Sophy showed me a different way to approach painting. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned all the basics having to do with painting, including technique, color, and composition. With each class demos by the instructor demonstrated a new concept in order to elevate our pieces, whether it referred to brushstroke, color mixing, and more. ",
            "\u00a0basic background in color theory, experimental work in painting technique like choice of tools, lighting, composition, brushwork ",
            "\u00a0I was able to paint by observation through still lives and landscapes. I was also able to know the different techniques that could be used to make a painting more appealing through learning about the color theory and applying it in my paintings. Another thing that I learned was how to create a portrait. ",
            "\u00a0-color theory\r\n-art history\r\n-general technique ",
            "\u00a0It was a good introduction to painting still-lives. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned to further develop my skills on observational painting. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my knowledge of color theory and my ability to paint from observation. I was especially interested to learn about how a color is affected by which colors appear near it, since this means that it is possible to mix the wrong color when you are trying to match what you see but the paint you are mixing is next to a different background color from the background of the color you want to match! And I learned that a shadow always has color in it; it isn't just gray but is usually a less intense version of the color of the object it falls on. I also learned to pay more attention to the texture of my brushstrokes and to enable them to better match the texture of the objects I was trying to represent. Furthermore, I learned a lot from the critiques and the opportunity to see my classmates' work. I saw how different people's impressions of the same painting could be, and the feedback the professor gave to my classmates was always, if indirectly, applicable to my work as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the skills to mix a specific color and got helpful advices of the steps of creating a painting.Moreover, I learned the idea of  ground color in creating an emotional envirnment. I developed my ability to utilize the primaries in my paintings and learned to understand the effect of different kinds of brushstrokes when delineating an object. The professor led me to analyze the basic elements of a painting and encourage me to expand my own inner thoughts of the idea contained in the painting, which helps me to develop my ability to look through  artworks in a wider context.

            "\u00a0I think Sophy engaged with everyone and was respectful to the students work.  She was very patient and explained what her expectations were. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include: gaining criticism from both the instructor and peers, and increasing in difficulty in a logical way (starting with basics like monochromes and moving towards full color compositions). \r\nOne weakness included the rushed timing of each project and inability to gain insight during the processes of completing each painting (which is admittedly inevitable during a month long class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well organized but not restrictive--the sequence of assignments pushed us toward working on increasingly ambitious, detailed pieces\r\nWeaknesses: maybe just that it felt a bit rushed over the summer ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that the student receives feedback quickly, but since the course is only in a 5-week period, there is a lot of workloads to do. Another strength of this class is that the student could paint whatever he or she wants, but since students are only here temporarily, students don't really have the materials they would like to paint. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Sophy is very knowledgeable about various artists and the practicalities of painting. Having our 'own' studio spaces\r\n\r\nweaknesses: Like many Yale art classes, this class was very labor intensive. The number of assignments and pace of the class sometimes hindered my ability to complete my best work ",
            "\u00a0While this course provided a good introduction to painting from observation, there was very little actual instruction. In my opinion, an introductory art course should be about improving practical skill, and less focused on the content and \"message\" of the work. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it progresses in terms of difficulty and allows the students to develop our skills by completing tasks with various difficulties and focuses. The weakness of the course is that each task could have been discussed more. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good introduction to ways of thinking about color, and how color interacts with value. I thought it was good that we had flexibility in how we applied paint, and that we looked at different artists' techniques. It was helpful to visit the art galleries as well, and to choose a particular painting as our inspiration for our final project. However, I think the selection of painters whose work we looked at could have been more balanced; most of their styles were quite modern, and it would have been interesting to see more techniques from other time periods. I also really appreciated how much individualized feedback each student had, from both the professor and the other students. I liked getting the opportunity to paint outdoors as well, and to paint each other, since these exercises helped me develop my speed, both in observing and in painting itself. I also enjoyed the space where we worked; the studio was spacious and we had the supplies we needed. However, I wish we had tried several different painting media rather than using only acrylic. ",
            "\u00a0The advantage of taking this course is that it provides a good chance for students and the professor to discuss various thoughts and there is barely no pressure in giving your own opinion towards the idea if an painting. This course can help you develop your basic painting skills while recieving good feedbacks from the professor and other students who take this course.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that the intellectual challenge of this course may be insufficient for students who are looking for it. Since this course are mainly focus on painting and color, students who are lack of skills to maintain the original look of a set of life drawing  may find it difficult to keep up. "

            "\u00a0Yes.  I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in art and want to pursue it further. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is both enjoyable in its projects yet challenging with its approach to technique, and is therefore a class artists and others alike will find educational and fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend it, but during the school year so that it wasn't as pressed for time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a great opportunity to learn about the color theory and apply it in one's painting. The student will be able to improve his or her artistic skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that often times art is an overlooked aspect of the 'liberal arts' experience and I learned so much I would've never known. ",
            "\u00a0While I think that this course provided a good outlet for structured practice at painting, if the student was actually interested in learning how to paint, this is not the course for them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that are interested in painting and visual presentations in general despite their previous experience with painting because this course allows each student to progress with respect to their own skill level and feedbacks are constantly given for students to reflect. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who either had some painting experience and was hoping to improve, or was a beginner but was very serious about learning systematically. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who only enjoyed doing abstract art or art from their imagination, because the majority of the projects were from observation only, and we were aiming to reproduce as closely as possible the colors and shapes of the subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in painting and color and who is looking for a relaxing atmosphere to share his or her painting  and feedbacks, because this course can satisfy his or her needs above well. "
