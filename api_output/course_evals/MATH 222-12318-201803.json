Though, instead on spending the last week reviewing content we could have learned more--I wish we covered the entire book (all the eight chapters) rather than just 6. We also skipped over some material (least squares) that I wish we would have learned in class. ",

In particular, aside from the three classes, there were also two (highly recommended) discussion sections, which adds up to a total of 5 meetings per week. That being said, the material was taught in such a clear and nicely-paced manner such that it was not completely necessary to attend the sections. \r\n\r\nIt could be improved by providing more concrete application examples of the material. We skipped the most applicable section of the least-squares.\r\n\r\nThere could also have been greater communication between the TA and professor in terms of material covered in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nLectures were always clear and concise. Caglar is an exceptional lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nPacing and workload were suboptimal at the start of the semester, but this was improved after student feedback\r\nHomework solutions were not posted consistently ",
            "\u00a0The course follows a very didactic sequence, and the material is not too complex. However, although it is called Linear Algebra with Applications, we didn't quite cover any applications. I would see this course as an easier version of 225, since proofs are not required. ",

It isn't set up like most math textbooks. Some problems take forever, some don't seem to have a question in them. The applications of linear were not presented clearly. ",

However, I didn't find the textbook very clear or helpful and I hope that future professors of MATH 222 find a better linear algebra text. I would also hope to see more applications of the material taught in the future. ",

Perhaps Yale should take a page from other schools, and teach multivariable and linear as a single, integrated course, and have a continuous curriculum into differential equations.\r\nI also signed up for this course because it would have applications instead of proofs, unlike MATH 225, but instead, we were still taught proofs. The only thing was, we weren't required to know them. So a lot of time, in my opinion, was wasted. ",
            "\u00a0It was honestly a great course, I just didn't apply myself well enough. I think this course would have been better as a seminar, to improve student engagement. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: A manageable workload, and professor Uyanik is quite warm to students. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The TF-led section were scheduled at times that were not very accessible to a lot of people. If you take this class in a 5-credit semester, be prepared to grind. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have been better organized in terms of feedback. This was no fault of the professor, but the graders who failed to return corrected problem sets promptly hindered my ability to study properly for some exams. In addition, peer tutor hours on Sunday were useful since homework was due on Monday but the other peer tutor hours took place too early in the week for that session to be useful. ",
            "\u00a01. Professor is very clear when teaching - it is easy to follow the material and read the textbook to learn if need be. \r\n2. Weakness - p-sets at the beginning of the semester were unnecessarily long and tedious ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I don't have qualms with this course. It was very strong and I don't know how I would improve it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this year the class is taught by Caglar Uyanik and he is the greatest strength of this class imo. He is a really chill person and explains the material really well. The exams are very fair and test what Caglar tells you will be tested. \r\nWeaknesses: the computational aspect of this class can be reduced a little bit and replaced with more conceptual stuff (I really wish Caglar had given more focus on proofs, because spending 20 minutes calculating the inverse of some ridiculous matrix or the determinant of a 4*4 matrix is just too boring compared to doing a conceptual proof). The class does require conceptual understanding though so don't think that simply knowing how to calculate things will make you do well (there are True/False questions on the exams that are like mini-proof/conceptual questions).\r\nAdditional weakness: apparently each time this class is taught by a different person so what I wrote down here might not apply to whatever version of MATH 222 that you will be taking. Do look up the instructor for your semester (I've heard from a friend in my class that the last time she took 222 she dropped it because the instructor was pretty hard and gave ridiculous exams that resembled nothing in the homework sets). ",

            "\u00a0Course was great and well structured, only weakness was that the graders didn't grade our last three homeworks, and that is no fault of the professor. He made numerous attempts to contact the graders and the Mathematics DUS as well but they either refused to do anything or ghosted him. Really unprofessional on the Math department's side. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was one of my favorite classes the past semester. Well-structured, the professor clearly cared about the students, and content was conveyed effectively through very clean lectures that made sense. Caglar is a great professor. The only thing I might have liked more would have been to explore some of the proofs and logic more as a class--but that is difficult to do with a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course in the professor! He was super understanding of students and always available to help out. ",
            "\u00a0It wasnt incredibly application based until the end ",
            "\u00a0I think lectures are very informative and for the most part taught us everything we needed to know for homework and exams. The material that was covered was distinctly what was on our exams which was very fair. There was also a logical organization of the course in regards to how we worked through each chapter. There was also plenty of opportunities to clarify information in the course by attending office hours, discussion sections, and by speaking with the professor before or after class. This class could be improved by helping clarify answers to homework questions because their current solutions that were provided were brief and didn't offer much of an explanation. ",
            "\u00a0Great explanations and good practices in lecture. But sometimes felt a bit discontinuous between sections. ",

            "\u00a0strengths were that is was pretty straight forward material and the lecture was easy to follow/understand. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths are that the material in itself is not extremely conceptually difficult, and it is very interesting. The math is pretty intuitive and feels profound. The class also builds neatly upon itself. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a very well taught course - everything you need to know is covered well in lecture and the psets help solidify the applications. At the beginning of the course, however, Caglar was a little unclear (when talking about the 4 fundamental subspaces), often going over the same thing multiple times but in different ways. Perhaps that could be due to the fact thats its his first time teaching this course. Afterwards, that improved however. If you ever feel lost, I would recommend looking up MIT linear algebra notes online - theyre very useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely well-taught. It was very well organized in a way that facilitated learning. It covered a few topics on linear algebra, so it was not overwhelming. I really enjoyed that the lectures were handwritten and were not seen through projector slides. It kept the pace of the course consistent and slow and we were always sure that we would never miss something. It was also a very good motivation for attending lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Change textbooks. It is a terribly written and organized book. Get to determinats sooner. It's weird to keep them at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The class seemed to go smoother than what had been forewarned by previous takers. Assessments were fair, and homework assignments were not terribly long. Your performance in the class is purely a reflection of how well you know the math. ",
            "\u00a0I wish psets were more of grade because they were long ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Caglar Uyanik was an amazing teacher. He put so much time into explaining the topics, holding review sessions and answering questions during office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is an application based class. Proofs could make it better, but because of the nature of the Math 222, there is not much proofs in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers relevant topics with plenty of examples and online resources. That said, the textbook feels very dated, and often times important concepts are hidden from the chapter reading only to be discovered in the actual problem sets (ex: relevant theorems are often stated in the problem sets). The greatest strength of this course is that, when taught with an excellent instructor like Professor Uyanik, the material is clearly presented, easy to understand, and accessible. Unlike other math classes, the material does not feel intangible. ",
            "\u00a0Very orderly and coherent, computationally heavy. Does not go in depth. Perhaps that is how the class was made to be. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the course was very bad. I did not feel that Professor Uyanik prepared me well for the first midterm exam, I had to teach myself everything through YouTube and reading the textbook. The second 2 sections of the course got better, but that's largely because I realized I just had to teach myself a lot of the material and the material builds heavily upon itself, so it forces you to figure out what is happening. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class, could be improved by going faster to cover more material. ",
            "\u00a0Quizes would be better instead of homeworks. For midterms 50 minutes is not enough. ",
            "\u00a0The class can be frustrating, not due to the class structure, but rather just by the fact that there is such a variety of students with different backgrounds. Some people know more than others. But if you take advantage of all the resources (professor, TA, etc), there are ways to succeed. The topics are interesting, though I don't feel like there were many \"applications\" and the content was sometimes more theoretical than I anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clarity of presentation of material and expectations for homework and exams. Flexible office hours from tutors, the TA, and the professor himself, such that almost any schedule could be accommodated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have liked to see more coverage of Least Squares, an applied concept important in Economics and many other disciplines. While we learned concepts relevant to this technique, covering actual problems would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Caglar was an excellent professor, with clear, straightforward lectures, and I definitely felt like I learned a lot. I do think focusing more on the applications of linear algebra could have been helpful, but I understand that there was not much time for this. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the format of the course, but I think it may benefit from a structure like Math 120, where there are several smaller sections. However, you would need to ensure that you have the adequate amount of teaching staff to teach the course well. "

The course is well structured and easy to follow -- one of the most well taught math classes at Yale, where the pace and content maximised my learning. I didn't spend most of my time trying to reteach myself the material, but could spend most of my time practicing using the material. The information is also useful to Computer Science and Physics, for example. ",

It could be that you like data science and want to get to know it a bit better. That said, I am not someone who needed to take this class, and I did not get as much from it as I'd hoped. I can do some matrix manipulation, but I am missing the bigger picture -- the applications. ",

Be warned that the subject matter can be a bit dense at first, but if you hang in there it can be rather satisfying to see how all the concepts interact (that's coming from a humanities major). The midterms are fair enough, but be warned that their shorter length means a few small mistakes can have a big effect on your overall grade. ",

Caglar is an incredible, caring, funny professor who was welcoming during office hours and great at explaining the course material. ",

Not much previous mathematical knowledge is required to participate as we mostly worked with matrices and their many applications.

Also, it's a major requirement for many STEM students and is a painless version of 225. ",
            "\u00a0Easy fifth if you decent at math with Caglar ",
            "\u00a0Yes but beware. Looking back, I do enjoy the material but I had to teach myself leading up to the midterms. The beginning 1/3 with professor Uyanik will be rough but once you understand the foundation the course builds upon itself so much you will be fine. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!!!!!! No doubt about it. This is one of the best math classes I've taken at Yale and is taught by an amazing professor! You'll be inspired to take more math classes after this! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend ",
            "\u00a0Most people take this as a requirement, so you probably have to take it. It's a lot of work--psets take a while and the best way to study is to do tons of practice problems. Go to section and office hours and find people to work with. Prof. Uyanik is a clear and fair professor and his exams are also fair. ",
            "\u00a0You don't take linear algebra unless you know you have a reason to be taking this course. So if you have no reason to be taking this course, I don't think you're going to get much out of it. That said, as a graduate student with programming and statistics experience who avoided taking math courses during my undergraduate career, I found the course very rewarding as it explained the mathematical basis for techniques that I had been using for years. Very happy overall with my experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, if Caglar is teaching it! The workload is actually pretty big (and the material is not easy), but I definitely understand a lot of linear algebra now, and Caglar is one of the nicest professors I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was taught very well as a course, and Caglar made it engaging and understandable. If you like math or need to take the class, Math 222 taught by Caglar is a good class. "
