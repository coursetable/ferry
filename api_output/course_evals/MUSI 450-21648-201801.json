            "\u00a0We learnt about a lot of the cool things we can do with Max. ",

            "\u00a0I developed an incredible insight into MAX and Konrad showed us dozens of incredible things that I can now use for future projects. It included so many things including, synthesis, crazy step sequencers, many ways to organize midi, loopers, buffer based effects, live visual building through jitter and I could go on and on. \r\n\r\nI think Yale should be very happy to have a genius like Konrad on their faculty. All my studies with him have been extremely valuable ",

            "\u00a0The main strengths of the course are the very interesting course content and Konrad's ability to create a 'chill' atmosphere in the room. \r\nWhile I really enjoyed the course, there are two areas that I think the course could improve on: \r\n(1)Mandatory labs did not feel super productive or useful. I think this can be improved by either having well-defined exciting tasks to do in lab or making lab optional office hours instead. \r\n(2) We didn't really cover many \"advanced topics\". It was very exciting when we covered some and I wish we did more of it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a really well designed introduction to Max. Class was really helpful to learn about new objects and the Assignments/Sections were great to figure stuff out on your own. I thought the first few assignments were really helpful in getting a working understanding of Max without being frustratingly difficult and after that it was nice to have a lot of freedom in deciding what to program for the later assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths incredible amount of information and useful things\r\n\r\nWeakness, I cant think of one.. ",
            "\u00a0its a great crash course in max, and it gives people space to work on their own projects while guiding them with helpful assignment. I think class time at times could be more effectively spent, as it sometimes got to the place of \"look how cool this is\" etc. "

            "\u00a0This is a highly engaging course for people of all skill levels. I entered the course knowing almost nothing about Max/MSP/Jitter and can confidently say that I have learned skills that will serve greatly me in the future (in a variety of musical/performance/artistic contexts). You'll come out of it with chops! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone who likes both music and technology. Max is a very useful and deceptively powerful programming language to have in your repertoire. Konrad's enthusiasm for Max is contagious, whether it be making high-pitched voices into the microphone or putting his face on a spinning 3D object. ",
            "\u00a0Really good course if you want to learn how to program in Max MSP. The course itself is not that hard but Max is a complicated program so if you have the time you can invest a lot and really learn a lot from this course, though even doing the bare minimum you will learn a lot. I came into this course not being comfortable working with Max and now I feel a lot more confident in programming with it. Konrad is a Max-wizard and the perfect person to teach this course, watching him build a crazy patch on the fly during lecture is a lot of fun and kind of incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. So much to take from it. ",
