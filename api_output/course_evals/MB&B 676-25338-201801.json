Learned about the proper way to keep records and convey your results to readers. Learned about some of the things not to do in terms of research, such as plagiarism and messing with results. In all, received a broad overview of what being a good researcher means and how to do it in addition to getting exposure to what not to do and the negative results that come with it. "

            "\u00a0It's an important course that isn't always engaging. Some lecturers spend more time on having discussions with students than others who merely lecture from slides. An ethics course is best presented as a discussion, and for the most part the course meets that expectation. ",

I think that it gives you the details that many people leave out and can help you in the future with your graduate studies where you will be living it out. I think that it was very nice to hear some stories from the different faculty members that they used as learning experiences and that we can use before we reach that part of our research careers. "
