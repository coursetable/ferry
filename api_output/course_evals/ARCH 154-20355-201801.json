            "\u00a0I was challenged in this course to really sit down and draw for the first time and in doing so my love for drawing and my ability to articulate space on the page increased tremendously. ",
            "\u00a01) I improved my drawing skills\r\n2) I learned about drawing as an \"essay\" by developing ideas in drawings\r\n3) I learned to select particular aspects of drawings/sites that I want to emphasize and thus making my drawing tell a story ",
            "\u00a0I believe that after taking this class my drawing skills have really improved. This course helped me understand the different techniques used with charcoal and pencil. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a love of architecture. I was able to engage with drawing in a different way than I was used to. In this drawing class, I learned technical things about the architectural process. Along with these things, I gained a new appreciation for the architectural buildings and features around Yale's campus. "

            "\u00a0Definitely strengthened by not doing so many assignments like in the past. I do wish we had spent less time in the beginning fussing over the plan and section drawings and more time developing the expressive drawings like the bundle assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1) Every class was held in a different venue (different places around Yale), which made the class very engaging and learned me to appreciate Yale architecture better\r\n2) A lot of attention to students and personalized feedback\r\n3) Opportunity to learn from others\r\n4) Focus on ideas in drawings, rather than the mechanics of image-making ",
            "\u00a0The assignments are one of the biggest strengths of this course. They were always interesting, with a level of expectation that challenged the students in the course. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in architecture, this course can be a helpful step along the way to getting to really appreciate drawing more. You don't have to take it to be successful, but is a good use of time and a good way to practice more. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course, since it was one of my favorite courses taken at Yale so far ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student because the course is different than any other course I have taken. It is a very interesting ad fun class to take that will surprisingly challenge you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it has many benefits. It is challenging at times, but yields great results if you embrace the difficulty. "
