            "\u00a0A very important course for laying a strong epidemiology foundation. While the course is an important one, class was not engaging. It mainly consisted of the professor reading off of the slides. However, there is weekly homework that helps you master the material, and this was integral to my success. The TFs were lifesavers. They created section slides to summarize each week's lecture material with easy-to-understand explanations and practice problems. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well designed and well taught. Weekly sections were a strength of the course because students were constantly reviewing the material and practicing answering questions/performing calculations. The problem sets were challenging and reinforced course material. This made exam preparation easier and improved my understanding of the material. Overall, I do not think the course could be improved. The teaching fellows were excellent and their review slides/jeopardy-style reviews were very helpful as well. ",

To improve, you should get an instructor that actually wants to teach an intermediate/ beginner epidemiology course. Professor Risch's uninterested nature came through during our lectures exemplified by his reading verbatim off of the slides and adding nothing of value to lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The beginning of this course was slow. Prof. Risch just read off the slides, so by the end of the class very few people attended lectures. The TAs were the saving grace of this class. I did almost all my learning through them--their slides and section materials. It's disappointing because this is really important information for future public health practitioners to know. ",

The Friday discussion sessions review the concepts covered in the lectures and summarizes the key points, and they are helpful for solving the p-sets. The exams are a little bit challenging though. There were several multiple choices in each midterm that worth too many points. The all or nothing nature of multiple choices made it hard to get a good grade for the exam. But the issue resolved for the final. I can see that the professor and TFs really values the feedbacks from students. Overall, it's a great class! ",

I also like the discussion session, which clarified most of my questions. ",

            "\u00a0Epi II was the most frustratingly, poorly taught course I have ever encountered in my entire life and a reason that I have told people not to attend the Yale School of Public Health out of the simple fact that such a fundamental course on epidemiology was so abominably sub-par. I cannot begin to express my sheer frustration with the fact that my $60,000 is going towards this course and the instruction directing it-- my only suggestion for those who will be forced to endure this course-- SPEAK UP. However, since no one in the administration legitimately reads or takes seriously the responses of these evaluations (otherwise Harvey would not be teaching any course), let me air my grievances for my own sanity by providing objective explanations for why this course was so utterly terrible: [1] monotone, painfully boring lectures: the lecture material was presented in such an unengaging apathetic, indifferent tone (with the exception of Harvey's demeaning and pretentious comments that I will get to later) that pretty much everyone stopped showing up to class; [2] confusing, uninformative lecture slides: even the TAs told us not to look at the lecture slides because they were so opaque and difficult to get through; [3] intentionally deceitful and ridiculously absurd exam questions: I have never in my entire life had as much difficulty comprehending exam questions as I have in Epi II. The exam questions were so poorly worded and constructed that the TFs even admitted they would not have arrived at some of the answers. In particular, some of his questions required extrapolation that was not even remotely feasible based on the knowledge we were presented in lecture. His rationale for these questions is that he \"wants us to think like epidemiologists\" and that epidemiology is naturally a \"nit-picky\" science-- No, it is actually not. Epidemiology is actually quite straightforward. But Harvey made the discipline of epidemiology so ambiguous, more confusing than when I had started the course, to a point where I actually (and yes, I realize how terrible this is as an MPH student) despise the content of the course; [4] his derogatory, demeaning comments towards others in the field of public health and own colleagues-- Harvey's elitist mentality (ref. his email title) carried over to an insane degree in this course, where he often put down other epidemiologists because they approached things \"incorrectly.\" I was drawn to public health out of the genuine good-will that public health researchers and practitioners have, but Harvey, whether intentionally or not, characterized a very negative aspect of epi research. Yet, as frustrated as I am by this course and Harvey's instruction, I almost feel that YSPH is more to blame. I actually feel that Harvey does not realize how poorly taught this course was and do feel that he is genuinely a good guy who wants us all to appreciate epi. I am more frustrated by YSPH, who should either obtain an effective instructor for this required course or provide Harvey the resources that he needs to become a more competent instructor. Lastly, the TFs were an immensely redeeming quality of this course and were the most approachable, incredible group who imparted so much knowledge on this course. I don't know what I would have done without them but truly hope that YSPH seriously and critically evaluates this course for the future.... since it clearly hasn't been done yet. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the recordings of the lectures. I think the midterms/finals were a bit more complicated than what was taught in class and we should be given more time to complete the midterms. ",

The course may have relied a bit too much on the professor's way of thinking as the TF's often disagreed with his methods, which led to a lot of confusion.  The strength, though, comes in the fact that the course required an immense amount of individual thought instead of just regurgitating facts. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course stemmed from the involvement of the TFs who did most of the teaching. They were all willing to put in extra effort to ensure that we understood and were fairly tested on the material. The weaknesses, on the other hand, stemmed from the professor, who delivered dry and engaging lectures in class. I truly wish that the class had examples that required involvement from the students but instead, Professor Risch read basically word-for-word from the slides and finished 20-40 minutes early during nearly every class period. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt like a literal repeat of all the same material from epidemiology last semester up until the last month. I would have appreciated that we instead build from where we left off instead of wasting months relearning topics in the manners the professor preferred just because he preferred them and has no respect for the ways others practice epidemiology. The textbook we used did not feel helpful and lecture definitely was not helpful. The material was not broken down to digestible amounts at a time and when students asked the professor to explain something in a different way it seems like the professor believed he was doing that but his second or third explanation sounded no different from the first. The homework assignments were unrealistically long and complex, again, the textbook and attending lecture not once prepared me to complete problem sets without attending office hours too. Exam questions were often unclear and the recommendation we were given by some TFs was to essentially learn to read between the lines for the professor's specific preferences. That is not a form of learning I appreciate nor would consider learning. The lack of moral was clear in that students often never attended lecture at all. We needed more practice under lower risk circumstances in order to apply the knowledge of the course and not just memorize it. We also needed more examples of the material during lecture. "

Also, his slides were just written blocks of text which made many question why they came to lecture. ",

He's deep down very nice and supportive of students, but at times I wish he separated his opinions from the actual material and presented students what the general scientific consensus is, especially since we're still in our early stage of our career. He definitely has a lot of opinions, but for students new to epi, there should be room for students to develop their own views about the material themselves. His quirks definitely got their way in how exam questions were written; at times it felt like we had to understand \"Prof. Risch's language\" as opposed to understanding certain terms in a more conventional way. He definitely cared about teaching and it was clear that he has spent a lot of time developing the material for the course.

            "\u00a0Epi II was the most frustratingly, poorly taught course I have ever encountered in my entire life and a reason that I have told people not to attend the Yale School of Public Health out of the simple fact that such a fundamental course on epidemiology was so abominably sub-par. I cannot begin to express my sheer frustration with the fact that my $60,000 is going towards this course and the instruction directing it-- my only suggestion for those who will be forced to endure this course-- SPEAK UP. However, since no one in the administration legitimately reads or takes seriously the responses of these evaluations (otherwise Harvey would not be teaching any course), let me air my grievances for my own sanity by providing objective explanations for why this course was so utterly terrible: [1] monotone, painfully boring lectures: the lecture material was presented in such an unengaging apathetic, indifferent tone (with the exception of Harvey's demeaning and pretentious comments that I will get to later) that pretty much everyone stopped showing up to class; [2] confusing, uninformative lecture slides: even the TAs told us not to look at the lecture slides because they were so opaque and difficult to get through; [3] intentionally deceitful and ridiculously absurd exam questions: I have never in my entire life had as much difficulty comprehending exam questions as I have in Epi II. The exam questions were so poorly worded and constructed that the TFs even admitted they would not have arrived at some of the answers. In particular, some of his questions required extrapolation that was not even remotely feasible based on the knowledge we were presented in lecture. His rationale for these questions is that he \"wants us to think like epidemiologists\" and that epidemiology is naturally a \"nit-picky\" science-- No, it is actually not. Epidemiology is actually quite straightforward. But Harvey made the discipline of epidemiology so ambiguous, more confusing than when I had started the course, to a point where I actually (and yes, I realize how terrible this is as an MPH student) despise the content of the course; [4] his derogatory, demeaning comments towards others in the field of public health and own colleagues-- Harvey's elitist mentality (ref. his email title) carried over to an insane degree in this course, where he often put down other epidemiologists because they approached things \"incorrectly.\" I was drawn to public health out of the genuine good-will that public health researchers and practitioners have, but Harvey, whether intentionally or not, characterized a very negative aspect of epi research. Yet, as frustrated as I am by this course and Harvey's instruction, I almost feel that YSPH is more to blame. I actually feel that Harvey does not realize how poorly taught this course was and do feel that he is genuinely a good guy who wants us all to appreciate epi. I am more frustrated by YSPH, who should either obtain an effective instructor for this required course or provide Harvey the resources that he needs to become a more competent instructor. Lastly, the TFs were an immensely redeeming quality of this course and were the most approachable, incredible group who imparted so much knowledge on this course. I don't know what I would have done without them but truly hope that YSPH seriously and critically evaluates this course for the future.... since it clearly hasn't been done yet. ",

Of course I think people studying epidemiology should take this course, but all other disciplines have so much to gain from taking it that I believe they should as well. If public health aims to be a truly interdisciplinary field, the more of us that have common training, the better. ",
