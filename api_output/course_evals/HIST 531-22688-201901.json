Perhaps list on the course guide the language expectations? "

            "\u00a0For anyone who is looking to engage with more medieval material, learn from someone who is not a traditional faculty member, and get to spend time working with invaluable material, I would highly recommend this course. It was a great class where we got to meet other members of the Yale community, read current material from up and coming scholars, learn about the state of the field, and interact with current PhD students. This class was amazing and it allowed me to expand my academic interests and be in an environment where they can learn from students in other fields. ",
            "\u00a0Sure! The opportunities to engage with the materials at the Beineke is a huge bonus, and the course content was interesting. "
