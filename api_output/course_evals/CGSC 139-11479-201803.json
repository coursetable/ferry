            "\u00a0This course gave me so much insight into the ways that infants (as well as a variety of animal species) tackle the cognitive challenges they confront on a daily basis. I really appreciated the wealth of experimental evidence the class shared as well, as it gave me an idea of the empirical methods by which one can try to understand those without language, as well as the accompanying limitations. I only wish the videos from lecture were uploaded onto Canvas to make exam prep easier. ",

            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge and insight from this course. Having never taken a developmental psychology course before, I learnt a lot about the theory behind the development of animal and human brains. This might seem like useless knowledge for a non psych or cog sci major, but I would disagree. Understanding the development of human babies, in particular, will likely affect how I interact with children. Depending on what your plans are in terms of having a family, this course could be majorly useful for you! ",

            "\u00a0So much! It really is such an information-packed class. I learned about the cognition of infants (and, in turn, how this impacts adult behavior) and animals of all kinds. There were varying concentrations like morality and social cognition, and all in all was a wonderful introduction to some of the material in the cognitive science field. ",

            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about both animal and human cognition, from a variety of perspectives, which was particularly interesting. I came to understand that cognitive science truly is an amazing field of study, and that there is still so much to find out. This course got me very excited about animals as well, which I knew very little about previously. ",
            "\u00a0One of my two favorite classes at Yale. Dr. Wynn does an awesome job of explaining childhood and animal cognition, with an emphasis on what the similarities are and what could be considered \"uniquely human.\" 10/10. ",

The combination of developmental psychology and comparative cognition lend to interesting discussions about what is uniquely human. Professor Wynn explained many psychological principles and previous research that pertain to this subject area. She highly emphasized empirical research in the field as support for the broader trends that she claims affect specific groups. ",

            "\u00a0This course was my favorite of the semester, and I wouldn't change a thing. Lectures were engaging, readings provided a diverse array of studies to consider and a balance of perspectives on different questions brought up in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- amazing lecture, great and intellectually stimulating essay prompts, very fair exams, caring TAs, caring professor \r\nWeakness -- literally the only weakness was that both the tables and the chairs in the Rosenfeld lecture hall had wheels on them so it got annoying but the course had almost no weaknesses in my view. perhaps a little more clarity on what is expected as far as how much empirical evidence you needed in the first essay assignment. I felt like the inclusion of empirical references was an assumed known for students, but as someone who is not a psych major I didn't know that was a requirement! also would be nice if prof. wynn had office hours so that we could get to know her -- for a professor who seems very refreshingly down to earth but brilliantly accomplished, I was hoping it'd be a bit more accessible to reach her but she never responded to my emails either. ",
            "\u00a0The best thing about this class was Professor Wynn. She is amazing and makes you want to come to class and engage. She is passionate and a great lecturer. There were no weaknesses to this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course covers the most interesting part of every realm of infant and animal lives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Projector stopped working a few times and we didn't get to watch fun videos. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Very well organized, interesting, well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings (particularly the review articles) were rather tedious. Studying for exams was also a bit stressful, given the sheer volume of material. Otherwise, it was an interesting survey course that covered a lot of interesting topics and left me with a newfound interested in comparative psychology. ",
            "\u00a0NO weaknesses! Dr. Wynn is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0This class has one of the most engaging lectures I have ever encountered, the slides are informative, visually appealing, and funny. Professor Wynn intersperses video clips from documentaries and youtube videos to supplement scientific studies, making the class both more entertaining and easier to remember. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very engaging course, and Professor Wynn was awesome. Was dry at times especially with hour and 15 min classes but it was an interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was very well presented. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well taught and Prof. Wynn is very lively and entertaining, as she is so invested in the subject material. Although the readings were posted and could be referenced on exams and essays - they were not really necessary. Sometimes they increased the breadth of what we were talking about, but studies discussed in class were often well-outlined to the extent we needed to understand. Essentially, one could put minimal work into this class and still have the capacity to succeed, but for those who are more interested in the material - the additional readings offer more depth and can be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the course include the instructor's energy, creativity, and attitude of engagement. It was successfully comprehensive in that we covered many topics, but was weaker in the structuring of these topics. Overall, I think the greatest weakness was the non-linear structure of the course, both between classes and within class presentations, as well as the professor's contradictions and empty spots in the research she was presenting on. The course could be improved by citing the studies more often and coming to class more thoroughly prepared with some of their more important, salient details. It would be nice to move a bit slower, in terms of the pace of the slides. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures and found the readings to be interesting and to relate to the material taught in class. Professor Wynn is fantastic and makes the course very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0loved the content but i wish it was presented in a more organized manner. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course. The content was super different from what Im used to (physics) and incredibly interesting. It reviews a number of really interesting theories in psych. I also think that Professor Wynn is a really talented lecturer. She brings a lot of excitement to lectures and organizes her slides in a way that makes all of the concepts she covers straightforward to understand.\r\n\r\nHowever, the class was also way to easy. I read maybe two out of the roughly 40 papers we were supposed to read. I was rarely on time to class, and often missed it entirely. Each essay took maybe 4 hours to write. Including the roughly 3 hours of reviewing slides I crammed in before each test (one of which I did fine on and the other one I felt good about), I spent a grand total of about 18 hours of time on this course outside of class (1.5 hours per week). Although I loved not having to spend too much time on this course, I think that assignments are perhaps simple to the point of weakening the courses ability to incentivize people to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes over a lot of material, leading the course to have less of a laser-focused drive as seen in some other courses. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as in this case, for this course, breadth is more preferable than depth. Of the many subjects that it does go over, the course presents them in an interesting and unique way. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the lectures in class. Professor Wynn would include short videos and pictures of cute babies and animals that engaged the class. I wish there would've have been a sort of rubric that explained what she expected in our essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really good overall. I think the powerpoint presentations could be slightly more organized - there were times when there would be lists and numbers would be skipped, etc. But overall the class was excellent and Prof. Wynn did a great job. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class would be better suited to a 50-min lecture, even if that meant having it three days a week or having a discussion section. I felt it was a bit too long. Besides that, everything was great! ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting, especially for students who might have never been exposed to any psychology related classes before. The reading themselves, though not necessary to complete in order to perform well in the course, were also very interesting to supplement the class material. That being said, I believe I would have benefited more if we had been allowed to take notes on our laptops in class. Professor Wynn did not allow this in order to encourage full attention and to prevent any distractions. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the topics and thought the assignments were very conducive to our learning.\r\n\r\nI just wish that the lectures were better outlined and we were given the names of the studies were discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- course is very well-paced and material is interesting ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging, I wish the slides had a bit more information on them because it would help when reviewing them later but as long as you go to lecture you'll be fine ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Material is super interesting and the lecturer is incredible. \r\nWeakness: a bit more guidance before exams would be great (was there for midterm but absent for final). ",
            "\u00a0The class was incredibly interesting, thought provoking, and overall educational. There are no clear weaknesses to point toward - the lectures were well run (Professor Wynn did an amazing job), the review sessions were structured and helpful, the TAs were helpful, very reachable, very approachable, and interactive. The class could have potentially benefited from an weekly optional section, but the review sessions were strong enough to offset any such necessary weekly review (and I don't know how many students such a commitment would draw) - overall awesome class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n-Excellent Lectures\r\n-Fascinating and cutting edge content\r\n-Well developed course\r\n-Excellent instruction and availablility from both professor and TAs\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-only real critique is that sections would encourage deeper engagement with subject matter ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wonderfully taught! Truly engaging despite the size of the class, felt somewhat intimate with questions encouraged.\r\nWeaknesses: Little to no feedback on essays. Each ended up fine because grading was generous but I do wonder how some work could be improved for future social science papers. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very good course and very interesting, however, lecture could be somewhat repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome. Strengths are the material is interesting and interactive, as are lectures and Professor Wynn. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the class was very engaging and interesting and the essays were fun to write. The exams were also very fair and the TAs were extremely helpful in answering all of the questions we had on the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wynns lectures were always very clear and well organized. All the content was very interesting to study and I never felt like we were being taught pointless information. The TAs were also very available to chat and I never had unresolved questions prior to exams. Overall the main strength of the course was its organization and relevance to cognitive science. I would maybe just change the weight of the grading: 70% of the grade depended on 2 exams, which was a little stressful. But the exams were never too difficult, so that wasnt too much of a concern. I also would have liked to have more feedback on my essays. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Wynn is an absolute G. I think this is the first lecture where i haven't missed a single class just because she made me look forward to every single one. She made difficult cog sci concepts interesting and easy to understand, and the class/evaluations fair. Can't say there were any bad sides - the teaching staff, the material and the exams were all dope. ",

The teaching fellows and the instructor were all very passionate and eager to make the concepts of this course understood be all! There are not much weaknesses for this course, except that the concepts covered didn't seem to correlate until the very end. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great and the videos are also helpful and engaging when shown in class. Some readings may have needed more clarification. ",
            "\u00a0If you go to lecture and pay attention, you will do completely fine in the class. I thought the course covered a lot of different topics and I would have actually been interested to have a few days where we looked at one or two case studies in more depth. The feedback I got on my papers wasn't really helpful and I felt like the grades were a little subjective but I thought the exams were fair and graded leniently. ",
            "\u00a0Better TAs ",
            "\u00a0The course is heavy with content, but the professor does a great job breaking down the information and presenting it to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a wonderful introductory psychology course, explaining some fundamental psychological principles that interest both majors and non-majors. From my experience, not many intro courses do a good job of striking that balance, but this course offers students that much needed foundation to understand and appreciate more specific findings. After learning these basics, this class covered such specific findings, leading to more engaging and tailored teaching.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I found the structure of the course a bit challenging at times. It was a mid-sized lecture, but I think Professor Wynn likes the experience of a smaller lecture or seminar. Therefore, she opened it up to questions when there was time (which I enjoyed), but I am not sure it was as effective of a discussion as she might have wanted it to be. In the future, it would be interesting to offer this class (or a similar course) for a smaller group so that the Professor and the students can engage with the material in that way. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that it covered lots of topics within the subject of the mental lives of babies and animals. Weakness was the lack of detail in some cases, although this allowed for a greater number of topics to be covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structured quite well--there were no surprises as far as the workload was concerned. You could expect to read three to five research papers per week, and take detailed notes each day in class. The tests were manageable, though not necessarily \"easy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little to no way to gauge improvement in paper-writing (there were three papers throughout the term), and I felt the grades I received on them were rather arbitrary. The design-your-own psychology experiment at the end of the term was like pushing me, a first-year student without experience in psychology, into the deep end. Perhaps it was not graded as harshly as a paper for a 200 or 300 class would have been, but it took a lot to figure out how to design an experiment on my own with no prior experience. That being said, I feel like I learned a lot and am excited to take more courses in psychology. ",
            "\u00a0The layout of the course in terms of notes, the Canvas site, and accessibility of the TA's were all major advantages to this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in developmental psychology or animal cognition! It was fascinating material taught so well by Dr. Wynn, who always went above and beyond to help us understand abstract concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! Professor Wynn is incredible! The material is super interesting and full of fun anectodal stories about the development on young babies and animals! Super informative and enjoyable class! ",
            "\u00a0Mental lives was PHENOMENAL. If Professor Wynn teaches it again, please do take it. Every class period was so enjoyable  one of those rare classes you can go, sit back, and just have your mind blown from all the cool things you learn. The three short essays were honestly so fun and thought provoking, the TAs were exceptionally kind and helpful, lectures amazingly well taught and planned with serious concern for being engaging, understandable, and accessible, and the exams were the most fair Ive ever had at this university (highly appreciated that they were conceptual and not rote memorization regurgitation like in intro psych). Honestly, if you are a first year or sophomore even remotely interested in psychology or people or animals or human nature or philosophy or evolution or literally anything, take this class!! I took it as a junior and wish I had found it or something like it earlier on. Dont let intro psych discourage you from psychology if youve taken it and gotten a less than ideal grade. The field and discipline requires so much more than the ability to spit out information, and this class will remind you of the value in your ability to think and be inspired from and even be skeptical of the content you are learning. Take it and you may be surprised with where it leads you and your interests :) Also just once in a lifetime opportunity to have Professor Wynn (whose own studies have been so, so, so influential to psychology) as a professor. I hope she continues to teach this undergrad lecture because Yale and young people really, really need more intelligent, caring, funny, thoughtful and able to teach researchers and academics and communicators like her. Will be a huge loss if she discontinues the course! I hope she knows how influential it was to my happiness, growth, and ability to be inspired by my academics this past semester. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely, from the adorable baby videos to the fascinating facts that you learn from everyday class. The assignments make you think about things you wouldn't think about normally and I found all of them fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. There was not a single uninteresting class (except for one when the projector / computer wasn't working). You learn about social psychology, cognitive development, and new research through fascinating experiments performed on babies and many other animals. The professor is knowledgeable and conducted many of the experiments herself.\r\n\r\nThe three 4-page essays due throughout the semester were definitely a time investment, but the prompts were interesting and straightforward. There are also two exams that cover general concepts in the course. ",

Professor Wynn makes it really accessible to students of every background (even if you've never taken a psych or cogsci class before) and is generally a really great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend this course! Id say fairly easy and fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very useful for understanding how we end up as we are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, but only for students actually interested in the material. It is a very specific subset of information, and sometimes I caught myself asking why I thought I wanted to take an entire class dedicated to this subject. However, I did learn a lot of interesting facts that can often be brought up in real conversations - which I think makes a class worthwhile. There are three essays that can each be accomplished in a few hours, and the tests are so straight forward if you know the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you are truly interested in the subject material and want more examples to research, absolutely. For a more intro-level course, I wouldn't recommend it as much. ",

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student! The content was super different from what Im used to (physics) and incredibly interesting. It reviews a number of really interesting theories in psych. I also think that Professor Wynn is a really talented lecturer. She brings a lot of excitement to lectures and organizes her slides in a way that makes all of the concepts she covers straightforward to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course topic might seem like useless knowledge for a non psych or cog sci major, but I would disagree. Understanding the development of human babies, in particular, will likely affect how I interact with children. Depending on what your plans are in terms of having a family, this course could be majorly useful for you!\r\n\r\nIt is also super easy. I read maybe two out of the roughly 40 papers we were supposed to read. It appeared that having not read 38 of the assigned papers had no effect. I was rarely on time to class, and often missed it entirely. Each essay took maybe 4 hours to write. Including the roughly 3 hours of reviewing slides I crammed in before each test (one of which I did fine on and the other one I felt good about), I spent a grand total of about 18 hours of time on this course outside of class (1.5 hours per week).\r\n\r\ntl;dr Interesting content, great lecturer. Its a Gut with a capital G. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good for any student curious about it subject manner. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This course is very cool and engaging. You learn so many things you didn't know would even exist. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an interesting psych course. I would especially recommend this to someone who has not taken other intro-level psych classes. Having taken both intro psych and cog sci, though, some of it was a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any STEM students who need to fulfill distributional requirements. It was a very interesting course for any major. That being said, it might benefit you to have taken an introductory psychology course in the past. Many concepts were foreign to me prior to taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0yes! very interesting and not difficult ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was my favorite class of the semester. The professor was engaging and the material was cery interesting. I looked forward to going to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! 3 essays, 1 midterm, 1 final. Both exams were very straightforward and the TA's are very clear on grading. They know you're not a psych grad student so they're not too harsh. ",
            "\u00a0An experienced psychology junior/senior would find this class easy; a freshman or a sophomore would definitely find it more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend it - it's an intro level psych course, and you definitely don't need any STEM or PSYC background to do well in the class or enjoy the material. The class is extremely well taught, the material is interesting, and the work load isn't significant - it would be an awesome 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0The course introduces critical thinking as to internal and external understandings of how individuals and social groups develop in both healthy and unhealthy ways. I highly recommend this course for science majors and for humanities majors. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was one of my favorite classes thus far. If you are even remotely interested in how babies and animals develop and how they view the world, take this class. I took it to explore my interest in psych and cog sci and it definitely reaffirmed great interest. Dr. Wynn is lovely, and her TAs were great and kind as well. Maybe think more thoroughly about it if you are easily frustrated by less concrete conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good psychology/cognitive science class that was interesting but also not necessarily need to take. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if the material sounds interesting to you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite class and I found myself sad it ended! Because of this class I am considering double majoring and adding psychology or cognitive science. Professor Wynn is an excellent teacher and she really transits her passion for her work to her students. I raved to my suitemates about how interesting this course was, I absolutely loved every topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I learned so much and lectures were always great. Please take this course, whether you plan on majoring in cogsci or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its Avery interesting, enjoyable, and challenging course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, super interesting and prof Wynn is great. Very similar to intro cog sci though. ",
            "\u00a0Hundo p, one of the best two best classes I've taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would!  Lectures are amazing and the essay assignments are interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course not only to psychology or cognitive science majors, but to people who simply want to learn more about the minds of animals and babies. It was a great class that did not need any background information or knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The concepts are very interesting and if you love babies and animals, you'll have a blast taking this class! The essays and tests are all moderately easy if you attend class everyday, take notes, and read the articles! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, really interesting and rewarding and not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in education or early childhood development I would definitely recommend taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the content is very interesting and can be applied to real-life situations. Students can learn a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in the psychology major as well as students considering completely unrelated majors. I think the topic is very interesting and engaging. Professor Wynn is a special instructor and a wonderful lecturer. Her exams challenge the students appropriately, asking them to apply their new knowledge in unexpected ways. Also, it is fun to watching short videos of cute babies and animals! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because every lecture was very interesting, and it was often easy to follow even with no previous knowledge of cognitive science or psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student, though specifically to students with a background in psychology. If you are okay with learning how to read abstracts and write papers for psychology on your own, like I was, then it was certainly a fun course to take as a first-semester first-year. The material was suer engaging, and oftentimes current, which amounted to an exciting course. Professor Wynn is so much fun to learn from in lectures, and reading her articles for homework made the course feel very special, not to mention that she could answer questions about her own studies specifically. Overall an amazing course; however, consider the learning curve if you are new to psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as it covers such fascinating and interesting material, and as the midterm and final are weighted so heavily, you are encouraged to continuously review the lecture material and this helped me develop studying techniques useful to other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an extremely interesting course that can completely change your view of human nature, so I think everyone should take it at least once. "
