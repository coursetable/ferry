            "\u00a0I learned much about the biotech industry, particularly the business side. Learned a lot of the in's and out's of certain companies and their drug launches. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about how drugs are developed, from the lab bench to the patient ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you about drug development and helps you develop skills to value biotech companies. It helps one understand the mechanism of action for important drugs and the impact that certain medicines have had in healthcare. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn how to estimate the size of a market, value a company, and think critically about actual business problems that pharmaceutical/biotech companies face. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of developments in the pharma industry and how one can view the business facets of the sector. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how a drug goes from being found/created to marketed, how to create market forecasts for drugs, and how to evaluate biotech and pharma companies "

            "\u00a0Its a good class with great guest speakers. The readings could probably be pared down a bit since I dont think anyone reads anything aside from the cases after the first few weeks anyway ",
            "\u00a0This course is really interesting and I enjoyed looking at pharmaceutical companies from both a biology and business perspective. Sometimes it felt like there was too much lecture-type material at the start of class and that took away time from discussion. Otherwise, the class was well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't really change anything about the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great professors who are deeply engaging. The only thing I would have liked to have had is analysis of life sciences businesses outside of the drug development sphere. ",
            "\u00a0Class was designed to be very engaging and interesting. There was never a moment where I felt bored in class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is not a seminar all the time as much of the class are the two professors giving lecture but this is essential as they understand so much more and have information to give. You learn a lot though. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good class if youre interested in the topic. Raskin and Dash do a great job of co-teaching and bring in some amazing guest speakers. You dont need a science background (theres basically no science after the first few weeks anyway), but knowing some basic finance/accounting principles and Excel will help a ton for the midterm/final. The final project is also incredibly long and tedious, though it doesnt require much actual thought. ",
            "\u00a0YESSS! Best class Ive taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that examines the pharmaceutical industry from both a biology and business perspective. It helps you understand the process of drug development and what goes in to producing important medicines. The workload is fine and the professors are great. Definitely take this if you are interested in the industry. ",
            "\u00a0I would encourage a student of any major to take this course. I think there's something here for almost everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you have a passion for science and are looking to apply this either in the medical or finance fields. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a very specific field: biotech. A must for any student remotely interested in the business of pharma. "
