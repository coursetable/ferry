A lot of that could be cut out for more interesting material or more insight/interesting examples we do cover. \r\n\r\nAlso, the problem sets designed by the TAs were often vague, poorly phrased, or flawed, and that could be really frustrating. They should be more thoroughly vetted. ",

Moreover, I understand that this is a department-wide policy, but the policy that only 1/6 people get A's is absurd. Based on the distribution of this class, you almost need 100% throughout the course to get an A. ",

That said, Eva and the TAs really did try their best to make the class as accessible as possible, offering lots of office hours, homework/midterm solutions (post-submission), interspersing fun videos and \"lighter\" things in between the deep quantitative modeling, etc. That said, office hours/TAs were sometimes difficult to access on tough pset days, but I guess that's a nature of the class difficulty and tough pset weeks.

Problem sets were extremely helpful in understanding the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were painfully slow.

Prof Chalioti was the only person where it would be useful to go to her for help and her office hour times were limited (as there's only one of her so that's understandable) I just wish that the TF quality was higher so we didn't have to always rely on just the professor to get help outside of class times. \r\n\r\n\r\nPSETS seemed MUCH harder than any other materials that we would get during class, either during the lecture (i would be 100% on board with what was being taught in lecture but then have no idea how to even start a problem set problem) or during tests the PSETS ended up not being good resources to study from because their difficulty was so variable compared to the actual midterms/test which seem more ordinary and also based off of lecture. I appreciated them being GRADED on effort but I wish that there was some sort of additional feedback given when an answer clearly ended up being wrong etc. but I just wouldn't realize that because no one would correct my PSET and for awhile I assumed 10 = i did everything right rather than I did everything but could have been right or wrong. ",

Had the practice problems been more similar to the slides from class, I think the performance of students would improve. ",

Also, the problem sets were completed for completion which was great because I could still work hard at understanding the concept without the pressure of perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe slides were helpful but she went through challenging concepts too fast and left those to the TAs (i.e. Slutsky's equation) and kept repeating easy concepts (i.e. risk).\r\n\r\nWe need more practice problems! Also, it was frustrating that this class was curved because everyone did too well leading almost to a downcurve. Students were separated by only a few points, usually attributable to simple errors rather than different levels of understanding the material.

I think the course could be improved by creating a clearer structure for how to approach problems, that is, teaching specific methodologies for specific types of problems. What I feel happened in the course is that we were taught strategies for specific problems (as they were shown in lecture), but those strategies often were insufficient to solve problems in problem sets /exams. Also, there should be better coordination between TFs and the professor to ensure similar equation formats and similar notation are used. It is a small point but the differences can become confusing.

What needs to be improved, however, is very simple. The problem sets, practice material, and exams need to be written in a way that the average student can understand. There were frequent problems with subject verb agreement, grammar, and variables that unnecessarily caused ridiculous problems. Additionally, the notation used was inconsistent and very bothersome.

There were definitely times in lecture when she moved WAY too fast over some pretty complex math concepts (and then way too slow over pretty basic conceptual stuff) so I thought there could've been a better balance between those (e.g., more time on math, slightly less time on easy-to-grasp concepts). It was also frustrating that the level of difficulty on the problem sets was waaayyyy higher than anything we saw in lecture or on the exams--a better match up between those would be a huge improvement.

The problem sets were generally good though in preparation for the exams and in helping us learn how to tackle traditional problems, but there was no real incentive to do them because they were graded for completionthe only things that really mattered in this course were the midterms and final, which perhaps contributed to my lack of engagement. ",

With that being said, the teaching (both in lecture and section) was not particularly effective and often only reached about 10% of the class. The other percentage of the class were left feeling discouraged and defeated. I personally felt as though I had to teach myself and the TF team was not particularly helpful. There should have been a bit more coordination between TAs and emphasis on student comprehension. ",

Professor Chalioti made things easy to understand in the time she was given to teach tedious and complicated concepts in class. Unfortunately, the class itself has too much material to cover in just one semester that makes it nearly impossible to have every method explained during class and takes a lot of time to learn on the student's own time, through no fault of the instructors. ",

The lack of organization of the course prevents a student from learning it visually or pursuing it at a deeper level. There is no skill in its content -- the inexorably long psets, without sufficient in-class explanation and only 'just blindly do this' explanations of tired TAs who cannot singlehandedly repair the teaching deficits of the class, make this class simply a war of attrition. The impossible length of the midterm exams striate students in a way that has nothing to do with understanding (and rewarding those with rote tricks or cheats). ",
