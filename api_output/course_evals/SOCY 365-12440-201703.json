            "\u00a0I developed the ability to understand motives behind both political actors' and journalists' actions. This class brought a better understanding to why and how news is made and published. I also got a better understanding of fake news and what may be perceived as fake news. ",
            "\u00a0This class encouraged me to be really attentive and reflective about politics, journalism, and how they fit together.  It was really interesting to study things relationally. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong analytical and critical thinking through a political lens. ",
            "\u00a0I was fairly familiar with the (political) dynamics between politicians and publics/politicians and journalists before taking this course, but I thought our emphasis on sociological lenses through which to evaluate these was really helpful, even if dense and leading to sometimes awkwardly quiet discussions. Overall I'm walking away with some new frameworks to think about interpersonal and political relationships and I think I learned a good deal in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to the worlds of journalism and politics, both of which I had had no previous experience. The homework also required me to practice reading comprehension and concise analytic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learn about how the politics in the news corporations work and the mechanisms that guide its decision making ",
            "\u00a0how to research, critique, analyze, and synthesize theory and historical context with real time themes, concepts, and events as they play out in the modern world "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the professor is extremely knowledgable and that the class progresses in a manner which allows for excellent learning. The weakness of this course is that sometimes it can be too theoretical rather than practical. ",
            "\u00a0Great format with lecture/discussion balance. Readings were all very well explained by the professor and students different perspectives were great. ",
            "\u00a0I think the syllabus was pretty cohesive and Professor Mahler did a great job of facilitating discussions where some participants either hand't read or didn't understand the readings (especially once we got into the sociology-heavy parts). I wonder, though, if I was able to make sense of the readings more because I've had a bunch of experience in government/political work and really pay attention to the news. Otherwise, I think expectations for assignments were extremely clear and we had ample time to get everything done. Really good overall. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is that some of the sociology readings were very dense and heavy, but then I thought we had really great class discussions regarding even the most confusing material. ",
            "\u00a0Other than the confusing span of readings on me-they relationships, the course was simply phenomenal. The readings were accessible yet challenging, and Professor Mahler did a great job of prodding for deeper and deeper engagement with the material in seminar. I will never consume news the same way again. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is Super smart and can really bring the lessons out\r\n\r\nWe had too many news of the new assignments which lacked any new real material ",
            "\u00a0Mahler does an excellent job engaging with his students and with his curriculum, in a way that feels thoughtful, efficient, and flexible; \r\n\r\nthe only way i would recommend improving the course is to eliminate class days where class time was spent just watching videos, or sitting through a documentary, since that can easily be done outside of class and feels like a waste of his talent and expertise; "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students! It is a great class that applies to one's everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if Professor Mahler is teaching it. Great class! ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course with the caveat that there's really little room for BSing if you haven't at least looked at all of the readings, if not read them in full. Sometimes this led to very one- or two- or three-sided discussions in a room full of people. The course gets into pretty dense sociology of relationships and it's hard to participate if you haven't at least familiarized yourself with the language. Don't let that scare you, though! It's very beginner-friendly, as far as sociology goes, and everything relates back to politics in the end. Professor Mahler is a great discussion leader and the course is a great way to get some academic background in the dynamics of relationships that you probably know a little about already. If you're engaged with the content, you'll get a lot out of it, and it's really not that much work, either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an interesting seminar that helped expand my knowledge of the field of journalism and my understanding of politicos, in general. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class. It offers a really interesting perspective about how news gets made, while also introducing some fascinating sociological theories that help you understand the concepts even better. The first half of the course is focused more on current events and changes in news making, and the second half of the course deals with that while also looking deeper at interactions between people, particularly in public life. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT. This course will change how you consume news for the rest of your life. If you have even a slight interest in some day running for public office, TAKE IT. If you have even a slight interest in journalism and its role in sustaining a deliberative democracy, TAKE IT. The course illuminates many interesting characteristics of political news making in an accessible manner. Professor Mahler is also dope as hell, and it is evident that he puts a lot of time into curating a thoughtful selection of readings and fostering deep discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes! ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course that blends political science with sociological theory. Professor Mahler is smart and engaging. Workload is very fair for a seminar, neither easy nor overly time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. My favourite seminar at Yale. Its Super tough but its fun to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of a newsroom ",
            "\u00a0Mahler is an excellent professor, thinker, and communicator; knows how to read a room, knows how to engage with every student, is considerate and thoughtful about how his syllabus / workload interacts with his students and his goals for the class, and consistently adapts his curriculum to maintain a fresh, varied, and relevant perspective; you can really tell he is at the frontier of his field of study, and i think every student will walk away from this class with useful perspectives they can apply no matter what their field of study.
