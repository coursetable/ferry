            "\u00a0A good overview of corporate finance ",
            "\u00a0I came in to this class with very little finance background. As an Econ major, I decided it was time to no longer shirk my responsibility to learn something about finance. Even though I don't plan on a career in the field, I am super happy I took this class. Kelly made it very approachable and manageable, building up from easy to digest concepts and adding complexity as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0Basic finance knowledge ",
            "\u00a0A primer course on corporate finance and how businesses choose their capital structure. ",
            "\u00a0Great class for introduction into financial concepts. Information that is helpful for interviews as well as general knowledge prior to entering the financial services industry. ",
            "\u00a0Stronger understanding of capital structure, valuation, corporate finance, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate various corporate finance strategies including new investments/projects, leveraged recapitalizations, leasing vs. buying equipment and mergers and acquisitions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the concepts and practice of corporate finance at the firm level, or at times from the perspective of an investor. ",
            "\u00a0An introduction to the basics of corporate finance. "

            "\u00a0Strength: Prof. Shue's lecture slides are very well organized\r\nWeakness: Material tends to be a little dry ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Kelly is an absolutely killer lecturer. The class was manageable and well crafted. \r\nWeaknesses - 3 hour lectures can be rough, but honestly Kelly made the time pass more quickly than many of my 75 minute course. \r\nTAs - Natalie was incredible, but Chen really was not helpful at all. ",
            "\u00a0Good slides and insightful lectures, but cases are not emphasized in the course. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most well-organized courses I have taken at Yale. The slide sets were extremely well-made and self-contained, and the course progressed in a very logical fashion with each lecture building on previous concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class and was engaged for the full three hours. However, I felt like I would have retained the class material more if there had been two classes per week or if there were review sessions for class material (not just problem sets). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well-organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poor TA organization and support of learning beyond immediate classroom material. Biggest issue is that this should not be once a week for 3 hours - far too long. Split it to twice a week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is well-structured and builds upon itself. It is very applied, and all of our problem sets are situational and allow us to apply our new knowledge to evaluate an opportunity or tradeoff. The professor, Kelly Shue, is super cool and very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of the course was the instructor, and her passionate teaching style. The course could have been improved through its level of engagement, particularly during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were always engaging but they were long - nothing to improve upon but just the nature of the class itself. More case studies might be helpful for the future. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend if you're interested in corporate structure and finance in general, useful information to know. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. The structure of the class is great, so take it regardless of the professor, but Kelly really made this class for me. Her lectures were super interesting, and she made these concepts really easy for me to understand. \r\nI highly recommend this course, even if you don't have a background in finance (I didn't). She gives supplemental stuff for those of us who haven't ever been introduced to valuation, and it didn't take more than an hour of work to catch-up and be prepared for the course. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a must for people going into a career in finance ",
            "\u00a0For someone looking to learn basic concepts of corporate finance in a very straight-forward fashion. Not very applicable to summer finance internships, but focuses more on theoretical ideas about what a company should be doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great whether or not you are planning on entering the financial services industry. Some basic concepts that everyone should know. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as this is a topic youre interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an absolutely critical and necessary course for anyone interested in finance and the corporate side. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if the student were incredibly interested in the ways that businesses tackle financial problems in corporate structure and investments, or how decisions in large firms in terms of their financial management are made. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they had a desire to work in finance since these skills are directly applicable. "
