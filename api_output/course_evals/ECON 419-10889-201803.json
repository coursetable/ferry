            "\u00a0I systematically learned the knowledge on time series analysis, and econometrics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad overview of financial econometrics during the first segment of the course. I also got a taste of cutting-edge research in nonparametric econometrics. ",
            "\u00a0A broad introduction to time series econometrics (with applications to finance). Everything was covered extremely quickly, so I wouldn't say I have in-depth knowledge of many of the techniques, but the term paper does a good job of reinforcing your knowledge of one topic. I also actually became decently proficient in LaTeX and R thanks to the problem sets and final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of basic and more sophisticated time series models. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep understanding of various topics in econometrics that will be applicable in my future academic and professional pursuits. "

            "\u00a0In this class, professor Chen is famous in this field, and she has strong knowledge to teach with logic. What's more, this class is with small scale, which means each student has deep involving in each class and can get feedback on time. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar format engages students. I got more exposure to research in this course than in most. However, the second segment of the course could have been more organized. Communication regarding administrative matters, such as grading, could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0I would've liked to have had a more rigorous syllabus - the course was originally designed to be like a journal club, where each student presents on a topic at each lecture, and Professor Chen fills in the gaps. Unfortunately, everyone finished their presentations by early November, so there wasn't much structure towards the end of the course. This could perhaps be improved by having each student present twice. The term paper was truly a highlight of the course - I really enjoyed applying both theoretical and computational techniques I learned from the course to real world data. \r\n\r\nIt also would've been nice to get feedback on assignments - problem sets were never returned, and presentations weren't really graded. ",
            "\u00a0While the course had interesting material, it was incredibly poorly organized and it was clear that the instructor was not invested in its success. Teaching at the start of the semester was incoherent and, with many of the topics taught through student-presentation, clarity of understanding of the topics wavered. We have yet to receive any feedback on any of our submitted assignments and there was virtually no support for our final project. Prof. Chen is incredibly smart and has taught me much about robust approaches to modelling, and the use of assumptions within econometrics, but until she invests more energy in her students and organization, avoid this class. ",
            "\u00a0The highpoint of this class was definitely the last third, when Prof. Chen presented papers and recent research. Prof. Chen is obviously brilliant, and presents the more difficult topics in the course with the greatest clarity and enthusiasm. It's almost a shame that she also has to teach ARMA/GARCH/etc.; while I was initially frustrated by the fact that most of the early course consisted of student presentations, I later appreciated the way it got the basic material out of the way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The seminar style of the course allowed for students to focus on areas where they were interested in. We all had to do the same problem sets, but we got to pick our own topics for the presentations and final papers. I liked how this enabled us to explore areas that are most-relevant to our research interests. Having a final research paper instead of an exam alleviated some of the stress that arises from learning complex material and instead prioritized hands-on learning. \r\n\r\nAlso, I appreciated the professor's  choice of course material; she selected chapters from a couple different textbooks, but she only picked textbooks that we could get digital copies of for free (through the online Yale library portal). That was a nice change of pace from the normal exorbitant costs of econ/math textbooks. The main source (Ruppert & Matteson) was also particularly helpful because it focused on applied examples and included R code. I personally learn much better through applied examples rather than the theory/math, so the textbook readings and problem sets complemented our seminar lectures really well. \r\n\r\n \r\nWeaknesses: Feedback (both qualitative and quantitative) was very limited. It was difficult at times to know how we were doing in the course and if there were areas that we needed to work on. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were definitely its material and Professor Chen. Time series analysis is incredibly interesting and has implications as far-ranging between fMRI analysis and financial forecasting, and Professor Chen is a giant of the field. It was really great getting the opportunity to pick her brain twice a week every week for all of my fall semester! I think the major weakness in this course is its lack of structure. Since the class was fairly large this semester, the majority of the lectures were taught by students. The presentations all were quite good, but it was hard to learn anything from them. This was because the majority of them were chapters (from the assigned textbook) that were plastered (sometimes quite literally) onto powerpoint/LaTeX slides. I think this facet of the course would have been less frustrating than it was had Professor Chen NOT been such a good lecturer. The few lectures that Professor Chen did teach were by far and away the best ones in the course. I think that future iterations of this course should include lectures predominantly delivered by Professor Chen, with the students being assigned small subsections of each of the topics as opposed to all of the topics as they are currently. I think that the course would benefit from there being more guidance by Professor Chen for paper topics as well. The only direction we were provided was \"pick a method, pick a dataset, apply method to dataset\". This was quite problematic, as quite a few of us were fretting during reading period trying to figure out topics. The structure provided in Ray Fair's Applied Microeconometrics class is probably best for classes such as these: Recreate results from a published paper; write a short paper by like Fall Break; extend said paper until reading period.

            "\u00a0Yes since this class is popular and the knowledge in this class is basic for economy. ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot out of this course, and would recommend it to the proper student. However, the disorganization would negatively impact the experience of some students. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in econometrics and quantitative finance, this is a good course. You'll get a good basic understanding of a lot of the techniques in use today. The research paper is also good practice for a senior essay. However, you have to be particularly motivated to get much out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's more or less the only econometrics class after 126, so if you're interested in more sophisticated econometric modeling it's a must. Not too much work, and Prof. Chen is brilliant. The class transforms into a more \"topics in recent work\" style lecture toward the end, which is the highpoint of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Chen is a genius and definitely knows her stuff. The quality of the course remains consistent throughout, so shopping period is a good way to get an idea of what the course is like. The topics get more complicated as the semester goes on, but there's only four psets from the book so most of the knowledge you gain from this class comes from self-study and lectures. You gain what you put into this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If students are interested in pursuing their own research, or interested in potential jobs in quantitative finance, this course will be extremely helpful. "
