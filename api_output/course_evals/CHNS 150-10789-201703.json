            "\u00a0In addition to learn a lot of new vocabulary words, I also learnt how to integrate them when having a conversation with someone (so the application of the word in real-life context). ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese has improved in terms of vocabulary and I now have a deeper understanding of Chinese society and culture. I would also that my listening skill has improved, although my speaking not so much. ",

            "\u00a0I learned more about the Chinese culture and language. My grammar, vocab, an speaking skills were also expanded upon. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to use formal Chinese grammar structures and vocabulary and additionally enhanced my understanding of Chinese culture. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that it did introduce a lot of new words. However, the learning would have been better if more time were spent on a set of words so as to make sure that the students truly know how to use them. ",
            "\u00a0The course is enjoyable and avoids some of the pitfalls of Chinese courses by not hammering down too much work. It helped me broaden my vocabulary and develop a good understanding fo contemporary China. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic and I would not change it.  I appreciated the text book which was interesting and included important information about China's history and culture.  Our professors were engaging and caring and the class was a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0The grammar could have been taught a little differently to ensure that it sticks. Otherwise, the classes were taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job forcing students to engage with new vocabulary and grammar. I also appreciate that assignments require students to hone every aspect of learning a foreign language: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. I would have preferred, however, if the course had given more time for students to engage in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class was most engaging when we had discussions and insight into the origin of words and phrases, but could get a bit tedious when we focused too much on repeating grammar structures, although I do see how that too is important for memorisation. ",
            "\u00a0The overall structure is very strong. The fact that the assignments are dispersed between hard-copy homework and online homework was a bit confusing. Otherwise, teaching was very clear and structured. "

            "\u00a0Take this course!  The material is more interesting than previous Chinese classes but the instructors are of the same caliber as the other Chinese professors.  They are caring and go out of their way to help every student succeed.   Your Chinese will improve a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the course was very interactive and enjoyable. ",
