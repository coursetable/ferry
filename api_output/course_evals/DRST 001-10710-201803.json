I became a dramatically better close reader and writer, and the opportunity to discuss major works of the Western Canon successively allowed me to appreciate several texts I was already familiar with in a new light and come to develop an appreciation for texts I had not read before taking this course. Discussing these works as part of a \"canon\" or tradition made it possible for me to think broadly about the nature of antiquity, the West (whatever that is), and literature more broadly. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of reading very fast is both a strength and a weakness. It's difficult to go in depth on all of it, but they do their best to go below the surface on every text. Some of the reading felt slightly out of place (like the Bible selections). ",
            "\u00a0I like the way that the professor is accessible to the students. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Slanski is amazing and is the star of this course. I didn't like how fast-paced DS was, but that's in the nature of the program. Prof. Slanski did a great job finding depth among the breadth of what we did, so I'm grateful for that. We did have to skip so much of texts, making the readings feel like they weren't always worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought we didnt spend enough time on some books like the Bible, but that is the nature of DS.  Otherwise, the course was fantastic and it was amazing to see how so many texts of the western canon cohere. ",
            "\u00a0There's a bit too much reading to get done sometimes, and many times we never go over ALL of the reading in class ",
            "\u00a0It is impossible to read deeply, and literature -- of all the disciplines (history, politics, philosophy) -- requires deep reading. One must follow the arc of a narrative and give oneself up to it. It is not simply an idea that a text offers. A work of literature gives content to one's impression of the world. How can this happen within a survey curriculum? I am not entirely sure. Perhaps a greater emphasis on the aesthetics of a work, as opposed to its canonical referentiality. If you read the canon chronologically (as you do in DS) these connections are not hard to find. But what needs to happen with a literature course is that the beauty of a work, its form, its images, are made visible, as opposed to simply its ideological importance, or the what happened in Chapter 24 summarizing approach. But perhaps this is an unfair criticism. ",
            "\u00a0There wasnt much preparation for writing the first paper, which was a steep learning curve. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was well-structured and paced; unlike my friends in other classes, I found the routine of Directed Studies refreshing and helpful, though I recognize that this class still posed a large workload. Sometimes there was simply too much to discuss in class, and I would have appreciated a way for us to engage with texts more thoroughly. I enjoyed the reading and writing assignments greatly, and Professor Slanski often encouraged us to take risks in our writing that allowed me to become a more well-rounded essay writer. Though the Western canon notably does not focus on women writers and characters often, I was surprised and grateful for the opportunities that professors created for us to discuss issues that arose with female characters in detail, including Sappho's critical reception; consent and violation in Ovid; feminine tropes in The Odyssey; Clytemnestra's grief in Agamemnon, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar style really makes this class. I could engage deeply with the texts because of the small class setting. ",
            "\u00a0Like all DS courses, I wish that some of the lecturers were better prepared, or structured their lectures in a way that was more insightful or conducive to learning. I sometimes felt that they were very all over the place and not cohesive. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think the professor's dedication to reasonable arguments was helpful because it forced me to be more careful when making assumptions about the text. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you want to gain a broad overview of the Western Canon. If you prefer close-reading short sections of text and delving deeply into a single text, other courses may be better for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would.  Literature is a great way to decompress from some of the rigor with which the other DS classes approach material. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend Directed Studies to other students (pending, of course, an interest in the humanities). It was obvious that this course and program was well-curated to develop more efficient, effective readers, strong writers, and well-rounded people. It is amazing how much more I understand about the world around me after a semester in Directed Studies, whether it be New Yorker articles or the literature I read in my spare time. The texts we read are influential for a reason and this program is truly the best way to encounter them. ",
