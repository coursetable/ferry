I now understand how to approach and value forest and ecosystem services projects. I also find that I can apply this knowledge to other projects, such as a proposed mine, and be able to understand and assess that project's value according to environmental laws and regulations. ",

            "\u00a0Not quite as applicable or engaging as I expected. I suspect the class was a bit too lofty for the expectations of the students, most of which do not intend to get into finance. ",
            "\u00a0Decently, but the ecosystem service side of the class was lacking in depth. Lots of forestry topics. The class featured a HUGE emphasis on discount rates, and I still don't feel like we were given any real quantitative or satisfying way of evaluating what discount rate to use for projects. It became a bit of a running joke with students. ",
            "\u00a0They fell short of my expectations. I do not feel like we touched on the complexity of any one topic with enough depth and we paid no attention to the ecological side of things. I find many of the topics we covered very interesting and promising options for conservation but the way they were presented just felt like a broad description of what they were. For example, in the payments for ecosystem services lectures, we were introduced to many different scenarios and what the status quo in the field was but did not touch on whether or not the financing accomplished its conservation goals, what the impacts were, how it fit into larger environmental contexts, and did not talk about the ethics of such activities. \r\n\r\nMy expectations were surpassed, however, in the field experience the lecturers had. I felt that some of their stories from their work and descriptions of how many deals go down were very valuable insights to help understand the field better. \r\n\r\nOverall, this felt like an introduction to the idea of conservation for a financial investment group that might be interested in exploring the idea more than it did a class for students interested in conservation and how various financing mechanisms can help accomplish their environmental goals.

            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the very real-world assignments. However, for students without that experience assignments that have more given variables (rather than requiring assumptions) may be appropriate, especially for the first few assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are having real-world practitioners reaching the course, but the weakness is that they rarely speak to that experience or the projects theyve worked. I understand some of that is due to a need for confidentiality, but it would be really helpful to ground these concepts in a few real-world examples from professors experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be much improved if rather than approximately 3 hours of lecture it was divided into 2 hours of lecture and 1 hour of lab. At times, lecture felt like it was wasting time by discussing the same concept with multiple data examples. It seems the concepts could be condensed into 2 hours to allow for hands-on application through time spent in lab exploring excel. Many of us benefited greatly from the TA's workshops and office hours, during which we could actively use excel to try out concepts, formulas, etc. A strength of the class is the fact that it is taught by practitioners who have experience and therefore insight into the material. This made the class much more interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The modeling aspects of the homework assignments are quite useful. The lectures are focused more on going through material that students could easily learn from assigned readings. I think having more of the class focused on lab work doing hands-on modeling would be much more useful. ",

            "\u00a0Lab hours would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0They need to hold some class time in the stats lab going over the models. They also need to actually show how to model timber ",
            "\u00a0The readings were good, but there was too much assigned. The classes were far too long for what was needed to accomplish. The information could be vastly synthesized. I think focusing on just a few key concepts with a series of applicable examples would be better than the technical textbook-type work we were learning via powerpoint, which is much less useful for non-finance students. ",
            "\u00a0Dominick and Deborah were trying to walk a line between (generally) disinterested Master of Forestry students who were taking the class as a requirement and Master of Environmental Management students that wanted more on the ecosystem services side of the class. It's a tough line to walk, but I was surprised they did not respond by making the class more rigorous. They seemed satisfied to mostly regurgitate data and information from publicly available reports such as the State of Private Investment in 2016. They both have a lot of experience in these kinds of markets but seemed loathe to speak from a point of their personal authority in the subject matter. The most interesting parts of the class were when we digressed from the lecture slides and Dominick and Deborah relayed insights from real deals they had looked into. We need more of that!\r\n\r\nThe course was not very in-depth considering the niche subject matter. I wonder if the ecosystem services and forestry components should be split into two classes. \r\n\r\nThe final project is really cool. We get to dive into a \"Data Room\" of a real wetland mitigation bank deal. I appreciated that it synthesized most of everything we had covered in the course. If there was more of this kind of thing sprinkled throughout the course I would have felt better about taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0The excel workshops were very useful and I wish I had more access to that kind of skill development in my other courses. Even still, though, I do not think I was able to take my excel modeling to a point of professional competency for the financial field even though I did improve. Dominick and Deborah were good resources to have with all of their experience and I feel I under-utilized that aspect of the course. \r\n\r\nAs for the weaknesses of this course, I will be blunt- it was very boring. In their defense, the time of day and length of the lectures is a difficult spot to hold, but many of the lectures were not engaging nonetheless. At times, mainly when the lecture consisted of reading bullet points on slides, I felt there were better uses of my time. I know classes are not there for my entertainment, but this course took many topics I was interested in learning more about and turned me off of them. "
