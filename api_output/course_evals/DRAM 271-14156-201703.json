            "\u00a0The workload is not very heavy. ",
            "\u00a0It was great that Joey didnt add to our already-crazy workload with his class, but I think it might have been good to have some reading and/or responses to help us engage directly and think critically about the contracts and budgets he would talk about in class. Not much work, but a little, to keep us invested in the documents. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It is a discussion based course. The summary powerpoints for each class might help easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This course was organized fairly logically, moving through the steps Joey went through in producing Gentlemans Guide to Love and Murder. That said, the lessons of the class were focused on an overview of the process, with GGLAM as the example - but what about the major challenges that can arise during any one step of the process? Sometimes, I wish we had gone into greater detail about any one of the documents we reviewed, or had an opportunity to practice the kind of judgment that Joey relies on as hes negotiating all of the deals that go into a commercial production, instead of only relying on a budget exercise at the end of the semester for practice in the kind of thinking Joey has to do. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Joey is a unique professor with several years of experience in the industry. I really like his teaching style and openness. I appreciate he created a safe learning environment that makes students participate more. ",
            "\u00a0Joey always wants to make sure that we understand the way he thinks, and the way he does his work. He is great at answering as many questions as come up to make sure that we understand the concepts hes discussing. He is lively and personable, as well, which gives the class the freedom to ask any questions that come to them, and to engage him in conversation about the work. ",
            "\u00a0Joey provided for me another class that was very enjoyable this semester. Having worked in commercial advertising, it was nice to hear about the management side of theater in the commercial world. Additionally, Joey is very easy to talk to and I felt that he was willing to help in in every respect with whatever question we had. It was an inside view into a curious aspect of the industry and it was very enjoyable. "

            "\u00a0Seminars by the lawyer and marketing directors were really useful. ",
            "\u00a0Our class in NYC with the other GGLAM team members was great and added to Joey's portrayal of the experience in a large way. It made it feel much more real and it was nice to hear their challenges from their piece of the puzzle. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is best for those drama school students who have learned other related subjects and doing an internship. ",
            "\u00a0I learned plenty from Joeys class, but the only reason it will be hard to retain is because the broad principles were easy to get, but we never practiced the individual lessons. That said, the documents he gave us are all great examples of subscription papers, cast agreements, and budgets, so those documents will be something I will certainly reference during my career. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by reorganizing structure, compact teaching materials and make those available online, using powerpoint for key points and takeaway. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had a chance to interact a bit more with the ideas and materials of the course. As it was, the course was largely lectured or dictated to us, with Joey just running through a huge list of points he wanted to get through, illustrating them with war stories from GGLAM. Occasionally, I wished he would ask us questions that allowed us to exercise our judgment, or given us short exercises in budgeting or contract drafting/deal making.\r\n\r\nI also wish we had gotten to look more closely at the foundational documents of a commercial production - the author agreement, the producer deals, the rulebooks, and the budgets. If we could have looked at the GGLAM budget as an excel sheet, for example, it would have let us see how the numbers interacted with one another, which could have helped us understand exactly where his numbers came from. Similarly, having an opportunity to read some of the CBAs might have given us a better understanding of, for example, how to budget pink contracts. "
