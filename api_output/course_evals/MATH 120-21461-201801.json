            "\u00a0I learned about performing calculus functions on three dimensional surfaces and curves. The syllabus is very accurate in terms of what you learn, but other than formulae, the class fell short teaching insights and knowledge that I could use without remembering the formulae. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned many concepts of multivariable calculus. I learned how to differentiate functions that relied on multiple variables, as well as use multiple integrals to integrate functions of multiple variables. ",
            "\u00a0I got very good at multivariable calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I managed to see the connections between Physical phenomena (Potential functions, fluid flow) and mathematical tools (conservative functions, flux, surface integrals), which made the course syllabus very enjoyable for me. I also enjoyed how things came together by the end of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0This course is not as bad as it seems at first, but it can get quite difficult if students don't engage with the material over the course of the semester. The textbook is not very helpful in teaching the material, so attending class is crucial. Exams are for the most part fair assessments of our knowledge, but the curve is quite steep and makes learning the subject very anxiety inducing. Grades in the class correlate strongly with students' level of engagement, and that depends enormously on what instructor students have. Students will do best if they are in Sudesh's or Daping's sections. ",
            "\u00a0Its a fast paced course but this is expected in a college level math class. ",
            "\u00a0it was way too hard ",
            "\u00a0The course just does a poor job of engaging students. I know it's a lecture and there's a lot of material to get through over the semester, but it is very difficult to understand the concepts if only the formulae and procedures are given. The exams are just brutal and the psets barely count towards a final grade, so that doesn't allow for any slip ups on the exams. Overall, make the course more conducive to student learning (especially students who really love math), so that no one else ends up switching from the major because of how poorly this class is organized and taught. ",
            "\u00a0Because it is an introductory course, a variety of concepts and equations are presented to the student in a fast-paced environment. This makes the course challenging but rewarding for those that keep up with the incredible pace and the many ideas of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it teaches the material very well and is a manageable amount of work. Weaknesses is that it could use more real-life applications and, sometimes, certain topics are not explained well. Another weakness is mistakes could be explained a LOT better on exams, often it's unclear why something is wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, interesting syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: ? ",
            "\u00a0Good lecturer and well organised course, just feel that the grading could be a bit better and more resources posted online. ",
            "\u00a0The information did not seem to be presented as uniformly across various sections of the class as it should have been. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course- it was taught well, and the materials were well organized to build off of each other as the semester went on. The class size was good, and I felt I could ask questions. The peer tutors were pretty helpful. When I asked for my test questions to be looked over again, my professors did it seriously and quickly. Their review sessions were great. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't say there are any strengths.  The course is built for people who are either abnormally good at math or have had Multi before, so students that don't hit the curve for not being in one of the two groups look like they're doing a lot worse than they really are. The pacing is very fast - I could barely absorb one concept by the time we moved on to something else. The course also assumes algebraic and trigonometric knowledge that you may or may not have learned in high school. How you are supposed to learn it when Yale does not offer algebra nor trig, I truly do not know. Also, the tests are intentionally difficult since the students that take this course usually excel in math, so prepare to fall way under the curve if you aren't one of the above. ",
            "\u00a0The way the material was spread out was heavily unbalanced in a way that made the beginning of the course extremely easy, and the end of the course extremely hard. Not only the material at the end of the course was covered at a lightning pace, but also that material was significantly harder than anything done before it. Due to this, students found it difficult to see all the concepts and theorems come together in a clear way and essentially had to cram formulas and applications without true understanding. The material is interesting, but the way it was presented made me reconsider my appreciation of math. The last third of the course found me completely lost, understanding each concept individually but not how they come together. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed to me that a significant weakness existed in that there was not a streamlined way of teaching the material. Students in some sections received power point lectures with printed out slides, while others were just shown example problems as a method of teaching. A more consistent way of teaching the class across all professors could make more of the student body prepared for exams and homeworks. "

            "\u00a0If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise go for a lower-level math class. The class isn't designed to make you enjoy learning the material, and it is more theoretical than anything. ",
            "\u00a0People also talk about how hard math 120 is but i feel like this is greatly overhyped. Yes, it is a fast paced class, but its not at all impossible. If you just put in the extra work once or twice a week to review what you learned that week and make sure you actually understand what is going on, it can help you a long way into the future. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are extremely adept at math ",
            "\u00a0No. Even for students who enjoy math, like I did before taking this course, it is very formula and problem based, with little time spent explaining why things work or conceptualizing abstract ideas. It is very clear that the class is being taking basically only as a prerequisite for most students, which makes the class experience very bland. The exams are brutal even when having done all the psets and prepared intensely. Unless you need to take it, I definitely would not recommend. There have got to be better math classes you could choose. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students that are required to take it for a STEM major, as it is challenging but rewarding. It also requires creative thinking to solve problems, so it is a good introductory course for students to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend it to someone who likes math, but I would definitely encourage someone like that to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, very interesting and relevant content. A foundational toolkit to solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a prerequisite for all engineering courses, but it is an interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they had a strong math background. Most complaints with the course are simply due to people being unprepared and I feel that the previous math class here does not prepare people well for this one ",
            "\u00a0No, not unless you have to take the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would. This class is vital for most STEMs and I think the mind and capability for spacial imagination is also important. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very interesting course if you like math. If you don't need to take math, I think it's worth it to take if you like math, especially the visual-spatial aspects of it. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't exactly recommend this course to anyone unless you have prior experience in Multi. The pacing of the class and distribution of the homework makes it very difficult to understand what is going on. I was on a TTh schedule: We'd get a lecture on Tuesday, but no practice problems to review what we learned; Thursday implies you understood Tuesday, but like I said there was nothing to practice with; then we'd get a pset due next Thursday, but you'll have to learn new material while you're still figuring out the old stuff. This jumbles up a lot of things in your head and makes it hard to figure out what you do and don't know. The tests also make you use some tricky algebra that makes it feel more like an IQ test than a test of what you learned in class. But if you have had Multi in high school - even if you did bad - you would probably get something out of this course. "
