This course simultaneously covers a wide range of material about comparative politics but also provides a good deal of depth on each topic. While the course can seem theoretical at times, the theoretical frameworks are complemented well by case studies. ",

I definitely lucked out though, because I genuinely enjoyed this course and was able to get a lot out of it. Learning about different regime types, electoral systems, tracks of development, the political economy, etc. provided a good base that can be used to take higher level courses in comparative politics. The overarching themes tie in with a lot of other political science courses, and I was able to apply concepts learned in this class to my American Constitutionalism class. It gave me a more comprehensive world view, and disproved a lot of preconceptions I previously held. It focused on the entire world, not just America and Europe. Additionally, the moderate reading load exposed me to many scholarly articles and how data across countries is actually compared. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Simon provides great insights into each topic, providing a high degree of nuance for a survey course. Readings are extremely interesting and complement the lectures well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The allocation of time given to certain topics relative to others seems somewhat arbitrary. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting and relevant, and I like how Prof. Simon brought in both well-known examples and countries that are rarely discussed to enrich lectures and contextualize what we were learning. The exams and paper were manageable. You usually did not have to do the readings because they were only on exams to the extent they were covered in lectures. Section could be dull at times and the most amount of work for class would be spent doing assignments for section. Sometimes Prof. Simon would focus on one lecture slide for half the class and we would thus run out of time to cover the material we were supposed to cover during the lesson. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class was the organization of the syllabus and material taught since it had a good flow and made learning the concepts easier to learn. A weakness of the class was the amount of assigned reading because it was impossible to keep up with all of it throughout the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0Felt a bit like there were four sources of information - the Cases textbook, assigned readings, lecture, and section - and during the course this was confusing. However, I would recommend that students compile everything from each day together and use that to draw a map of the information they need to know. The course was generally well organized chromatically and felt like we methodically covered everything we needed. It was just a lot of information from a lot of different places, and a little heads up about how to integrate each piece into the overall picture of the course might have been nice. ",

I do feel that a lot of the course was lost in the lack of in-class conversation as a result of it being a lecture. I think this class would be an incredible seminar. ",

",

So, I arbitrarily picked one of the random courses I had shopped and submitted my schedule. Funnily enough, it became my favorite class of the semester.\r\nThe material was very organized and lectures tied directly to the readings (although you don't necessarily have to do the readings, it makes preparing for the midterm and final much easier). On that note, the exams were incredibly simple (honestly, my high school tests were harder) and straightforward. My TA was also fantastic, and made this class infinitely more understandable and enjoyable. ",
