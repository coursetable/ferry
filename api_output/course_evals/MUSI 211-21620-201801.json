            "\u00a0In class, we learned how to analyze late 18th century music. We also learned about musical techniques such as linear chromaticism, equal division of the octave, different uses of the diminished seventh chord, and hexatonicism. I think that I can now look at romantic music with a more critical eye, but I do not think I have gained the ability to understand what is going on harmonically with the music by analyzing the score by myself. I still think I need a lot of help, so although my skills have definitely improved by taking this course, I do not think this course achieved its goal of making me proficient in analyzing romantic music. I do think that this course has made me a better composer, and I look forward to applying the techniques we learned to future compositions. ",
            "\u00a0I have become comfortable at analyzing music from the western classical music canon and have gained a wider knowledge of the repertoire and composers therein. ",

            "\u00a0It's a bit of a smattering of topics that could probably be organized into a more cohesive syllabus ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job introducing different composition techniques that were used in the romantic era. However, I think that the main goal of teaching those techniques is to help us analyze music from that period, and I do not think that the course does a good job helping us apply that knowledge. During class when we were learning a technique, I would able to answer all the questions and I would understand the material, but when I got home to do the homework, I would find it nearly impossible to apply. I think that this is because we had very little guidance on what was expected when we analyzed the homework. For example, during the beginning of the semester, I would get points removed for not clearly marking my pivot chords, so I started really looking for them. By the end of the semester however, the music we were analyzing was more complex and didn't use pivot chords but when I was doing my homework, I was still looking for them. Therefore when I turned in my homework with fewer key changes marked, I got points off again, even though I was using past critiques as I was doing my homework. I found that extremely frustrating, and it made it difficult for me to enjoy the course, even though I really love music and I want to get better at analyzing it. I think that if we were given a couple more guidelines when analyzing pieces by ourselves, it would be really helpful because then the homework would be less stressful and when we went out into the world, we could have a couple of templates for music analysis in our heads. We always went over homework in class, but I think it would be better if I was able to more successfully do the homework on the first attempt with help then getting help after doing it incorrectly.

            "\u00a0Music 211 was very analysis-based, which was difficult but very worth-while.  We were very engaged in the scores we studied, but there could have been more part-writing, like in 210 where we got a lot of practice in voice-leading.  Another improvement would have been so study a wider range of countries and musical styles, but I understand that it would require perhaps a different course altogether or longer than a semester. ",

            "\u00a0This is a required course for students interested in taking music lessons for credit. I do think that I will use the knowledge I learned in the course in my future musical endeavors. However, I would recommend taking it with another teacher. Stephen did not do a good job helping us apply the knowledge we learned in class and I think that that is a key feature of the course. If there is another teacher available who is better at that, I would definitely go with that option. ",
