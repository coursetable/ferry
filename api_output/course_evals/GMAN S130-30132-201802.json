            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I had taken L1 and L2 German courses during normal Yale semesters and thus had a firm foundation in the basics of German language and culture. However, taking this course in an immersive summer setting in Germany made a remarkable difference. While I had done well in the L1 and L2 courses, I did not feel at all confident speaking freely in spontaneous conversations, especially with native German speakers, and I felt that what I was capable of saying in German was quite limited. I was amazed how quickly this began to change in Jena, both inside and outside of the classroom. Living with a host family was extremely helpful, as it exposed me to German culture and how Germans truly speak to each other in day to day life. It also provided constant practice of the German I was learning in the classroom. In terms of the coursework itself, focusing specifically on German for an extended period of time allowed me to learn much quicker than in the Yale setting, where I would go to class for 50 minutes a day but not think much about German throughout the rest of my days, filled with other commitments and distractions. I also felt that the coursework was very relevant and useful, and often found myself naturally applying vocabulary and grammar learned and practiced in class in everyday settings. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course significantly improved my German speaking/reading/writing capability.  It also immersed me better in the culture of Germany which was a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an intermediate German course with an emphasis on different cities and German culture. Because this course takes place in Germany, the class is able to visit different cities that are taught in class and learn about their culture. The students also must only speak German for the duration of the four weeks during this class. ",
            "\u00a0I have never learned so much material in four weeks as I did during the 130 course in Jena. Of course, taking German 130 in Germany helped me improve my German language skills (particularly listening), but it also was a fantastic window into German culture. Those insights spanned from learning about the German Bildungssystem (education system) and the bottle Pfand to Theresa's explanations of colloquial German usage & discussion of lifestyle differences between our home countries and what we experienced in Jena with our host families. Theresa would always check in with us from time to time during class to see if we had any questions about new words we'd heard or unfamiliar practices we'd witnessed, and I found that to be a really valuable addition to the class material that most definitely would not have existed had I taken a normal 130 class at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0I honed my German reading, speaking, writing, and listening skills, and was well-prepared for German 140. ",
            "\u00a0I developed much a stronger capacity for every aspect of my German. I made serious improvements in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The course offered a great practice of language skills as well as some insight into the German culture through the focus on individual cities. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of German culture and language during Dr. Schenker's course. Her instruction was nothing short of superb  I can honestly say in my years and years of taking language courses (both at Yale and before), I have never had as thorough and concise instructor as Dr. Schenker. I was able to gain a newfound confidence in practicing my German language ability, specifically my speaking ability, and by the end of the course I was able to hold everyday conversations with the locals of Jena with little to no difficulty. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly improved german language skills and also had a great experience living in a different country. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot even begin to describe how much I learned in this course. I went from being truly unable to string a sentence together in German to being able to converse with locals in less than a month. I also learned a lot about myself and my learning styles. Between my host family and class, every day brought forth a new self-discovery. The increased speed and workload taught me how to organize my time well. "

        [
            "\u00a0The fact that Theresa Schenker teaches this class is what makes it so strong. Her energy and genuine commitment to making the class cool was what set my learning over the top. She was responsive to student feedback throughout, but more importantly, she solicited feedback. I was thoroughly impressed with how tailored this class was. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class include everything mentioned above: the coursework was very relevant and applicable to everyday life; what was learned in and out of the classroom were not two separate things, but rather continuously built upon one another. I also liked the way the syllabus was arranged such that in addition to vocabulary and grammar we learned a lot about cultural aspects of and different cities in Germany, including how we usually learned about cities before visiting them. I also thought it was very beneficial to our speaking abilities that we often practiced speaking to each other in class. Additionally, the trips to neighboring cities were also valuable and an enjoyable cultural aspect of the course. The only weakness is that I felt we sometimes had so much homework that I wished I could spend more time with my host family or going out and really experiencing life in Germany. I understand that we have a lot of material to get through and value the immersive aspect of the course, because it truly does help you to improve your German very quickly, but I think it could be productive to cut down the number of homework assignments due on the weekend (such as Friday Quia) and on days before tests or when we have evening events planned. It was difficult, for example, to have the farewell dinner with our host families Thursday night and then still have to finish editing our final project, study for our final exam, make blog posts, and also complete Quia. Not only was I exhausted the next day from being up very late to finish this the night before, I still had more Quia, blog posts, and a speaking task to complete that final Friday. I was sad to have to spend our final day in Jena inside doing so much work rather than doing something fun or spending the time with my host family. ",
            "\u00a0The course in total was very strong.  The layout of the class made engage deeply with the subject matter and noticeably improve my capabilities with the German language. ",
            "\u00a0This class was particularly good at developing speaking and listening skills, partly because it takes part in Germany. It is also very good about teaching about things that take place in modern German culture, and how German history affects how citizens act in the present. Also, it is very interesting to visit the different cities in Germany and see the similarities and differences from American cities. A weakness of the course is that every class is 3 hours, and it can be hard to concentrate for that long at times, but that's what you get if you have to learn a Semester's worth of German in 4 weeks. That being said, Theresa does a really good job at reading the class and switching the topic of instruction when she sees that we're bored. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Theresa Schenker is not only easily the best German professor I've had, but also by far the best professor I've had at Yale. I cannot fathom where she derives all of her energy from. She was so animated during class throughout the entire month of teaching us three hours a day for a month straight. Her explanations were always clear, and she always made an effort to keep everybody on the same page. And aside from her top-notch teaching, she is an absolute angel of a person. She never failed to bring light (and candy!) to the room, and it was an absolute joy to go on so many Ausflugs with her at the helm. Another strength of the class was being able to take it in Jena, where we could be fully immersed in German culture & finally feel like what we'd been learning since beginner's German was relevant. We also got to meet Theresa's younger sister (who's around the age of most of the students in the class) & one of her friends from university, which was a really cool way to get to make a couple of friends in Jena instead of always socializing only with the other people in our class. Weaknesses: Not many at all. The one thing that I think that could make the program better in the future is reconfiguring the workload (especially the Quia) so that it takes weekend trips/day trips/evening events into consideration, so that there aren't nights with a huge pile of work that results in reduced time with host families. I did feel like I spent more time on homework during 130 portion of the program as compared to 140. Though it felt like a lot at the time, I wouldn't change that because there's just comparably so much more to do in Berlin (sightseeing/unrelated to class) than there is in Jena, so it was good that the workload felt comparably lighter once we got to 140. But I would definitely say the timing of the work throughout the month in Jena was slightly off. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good continuation of GMAN 110 and 120, and it covers a good base of cultural knowledge too.  Especially because of taking it with Frau Schenker, the course was fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Theresa Schenker is an amazing professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Classes are 3 hours long which can be a little rough. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was mostly strong, although the video presentation may not be the best way to end the course. The burden of editing typically falls on one individual, which is too much. ",
            "\u00a0Being able to study German in Germany was an invaluable experience. I was able to improve as much from the class as I was from living and speaking with my host family. Professor Schenker was also a phenomenal teacher. She is by far the best language instructor I've experienced at Yale and probably that I've ever had the opportunity to learn under. One of the things I wasn't as pleased with the class about was that it felt like we did a lot of unnecessary review in terms of some of the vocabulary and especially in terms of the grammar. I see why they used the textbook to prepare for class trips to each city, but jumping around the chapters didn't feel like the most efficient way to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the planned activities, specifically during our trips to other cities in Germany, not only erred on the side of boring/unentertaining but also seemed to be ill-advised uses of time and money. This is not to say all of the trips suffered from this, nor that the few activities of which I do speak affected the entire experience abroad for the worse. The 3-hour foot tour of Munich was perhaps the most egregious example that comes to mind during this course. It was stifling hot that day, and 3 hours outside on foot was nothing short of miserable, specifically because the students were given little to no information of exactly how long the tour would be until it took place (though this is no fault of the program or the activity, understandably). The activity itself (a question-and-riddle-led foot tour of the city of Munich) was very confusing to understand, even for the professor, and so did not run efficiently (made worse by the sun and heat), nor did it really impart useful information to the students at each site. Moreover, the time spent at each site was much too short to actually take it in, learn about it, look around, and familiarize oneself with it. The students unanimously voiced our dislike and discomfort with the activity, and proposed that we shorten the extensive list of sites-to-visit so that we could spend more time at them, explore them, talk about them, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of material that I learned was astonishing. Class each day was engaging and challenging, but I didn't really feel overwhelmed. The only suggestion I have is regarding the homework. While I understand that this is an intensive course, I thought that it often got in the way of fully experiencing life outside of class. There were a lot of times that my host family wanted to take me out to go see or do something, but I was always conflicted about going because I knew that in exchange, I'd have to stay up till 2am. There were also a few days that just felt insane, where there was massive amounts of Quia, a test, and we had a class event the same evening. In the future, I think that some work should be done on trying to balance out the homework load. ",
            "\u00a0I truly believe there were no weaknesses to this course. As I discussed in other responses, this class was phenomenal and was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0As long as Theresa Schenker is teaching this course, scramble to take it. So viel Spass! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any other German student. I loved every second, got much out of it, and felt very lucky to be there. Taking L3 at Yale can't compare to the immersion in the language and culture (as well as the fun) that you will have during the summer program. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other German students, I think a summer immersion program like this is virtually guaranteed to improve ones German ability more than a typical course taught not in Germany would. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only do you get to learn about German culture and talk about material that is actually relevant to modern German culture, but you get to visit the cities that you learn about in the textbook. You can see what you are learning in action, not to mention Jena is a fantastic small-city to live in. You get to live in Germany for four weeks with this class, and experience German cuisine and culture in a beautiful East-German city. Especially take this course if Theresa Schenker is teaching it. She is one of the best professors that I have had, if not the best professor that I have had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! There is absolutely no way to get the cultural experience we got in Jena through a class taught in New Haven (or anywhere else that's not small-city Germany). The teaching was fantastic, Jena is an absolutely gorgeous city that quickly feels like home, and the day/weekend trips were a whole lot of fun. Plus, the Stationen textbook just makes a lot more sense when you actually get to visit the cities you're studying. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! If you want to carry on learning German, this is the course for you. Especially if you are able to take it with Frau Schenker, the course is an absolute pleasure - it is fun, engaging, and the classroom environment is a warm place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if Theresa Schenker is your professor, take it, she is absolutely amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it will greatly improve your language skills, more so than a course in New Haven might. ",
            "\u00a0This program is an incredible opportunity for any student learning German. I would recommend this program to any student however interested, whether or not they consider German a big part of their studies. This program is especially worthwhile if it continues to be in Germany all 8 weeks, because I found Jena a great place. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is considering studying abroad. This course was quite honestly one of the best educational experiences I have had, not only at Yale but in my educational career. Though the town of Jena is itself not the most riveting place to live for four weeks, the instruction and mentorship provided by Dr. Schenker, and the comprehensiveness with which she approaches her teaching and leading the program, are not only inspiring but thoroughly educational. The best language instruction experience I have ever had, hands down. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anther student. I can't believe how much I learned. It was fun, engaging, and I learned so much more than I would have in New Haven. The class was great, the trips were fun, and the host family experience is something that I will always remember. The connections that I made there in Germany are ones that I hope to maintain for years to come. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I had an amazing time in Jena-- the town is wonderful and Theresa is an amazing professor. German 130 in Germany is a must and I definitely recommend if you are looking or some experience abroad! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course is great for anyone learning German. "
