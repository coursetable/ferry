            "\u00a0This was an amazing class. The seminar style invited students to participate and share their unique stories in a supportive environment. I really appreciated every single assignment we did as it increased my understanding of the topics we discussed in class. The feedback on my work was phenomenal and truly thought provoking. This caused me to positively alter my work and think about topics. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. The structure was clear and expectations were established at the beginning of the semester. Student-led discussions anchored the course and allowed us to dive deeply into several topics. The guest speakers were excellent. My one piece of feedback - the Canvas site was a bit tricky to navigate. It might have been easier if assignments could be submitted on Canvas, to help us keep track of deadlines. The readings (in \"Course Reserves\" this semester) would have been easier to access if they were in folders under \"Files.\" ",

Strengths: wonderful professor, students work in groups to lead one class, seminar-style class with lots of discussions, really good guest speakers, students learn to write a research proposal. Weakness: maybe a smaller class would allow for deeper discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is excellent from how the desks are arranged to facilitate discussion to how we group lead a week once per semester. The course also covered a wide range of topics that made it relevant to all and was thought-provoking. ",

The topic of the course is interesting and it covers a wide breath of topics related to aging. I think the course would be even better if the first weeks of class already had readings assigned so that there could be more time at the end of the semester for final project presentations or other discussions.
