General concepts that inform preparing and conducting a field survey/assessment. And theoretical notions that inform our societal approaches to managing healthy forests. ",

Lots on policy, philosophy, and broad-level management. Later in the course (after spring break), more on the specifics of identifying and managing different pests and pathogens. Plenty of discussion (and some specific insights into) the definitions of forest health, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectations. The class covered a significant amount of information, but made this information accessible. ",
            "\u00a0I was hoping to learn a little bit more about field identification of forest health issues and basic management applications for them. This course was great in providing overviews, but a little bit lacking in field skills. ",
            "\u00a0The class could have been a bit more practical. It is a seminar so I expected discussion, but more practical management  would have made these things a little more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0In some ways, I learned a lot from the class. I became much more familiar with the major insect pests and pathogens in our forests--which might help me as a forest manager. I also have better understanding of the complexities of managing and preventing these forest health issues--which allows me to speak more intelligently about them. However, I did not gain a strong ability to field-identify many of these pests and pathogens (and the ones I did learn to identify, I did so through means external to the class). I wish I'd learned more about the individuals and how to work with them (and also, identification, which seems pretty key to me). Also, I wish we'd spent more time learning about abiotic forest health issues, like air pollution and anthropogenic issues (cars, utility lines, suburban sprawl, mining). ",
            "\u00a0It did not meet my expectations.  I expected to learn all about the most important forest pests and pathogens and how to manage them.  We never got any concrete information about how to react to any of these issues, only that they're here, they're important, they're growing, they will have a huge negative impact, and they're really hard to deal with. ",
            "\u00a0I expected that we would go deeper into the technical aspects of forest health, such as identification of signs and symptoms in the field and lab. I also thought we would develop more skills relating to diagnosing forest health issues and developing management prescriptions. The course was pretty lacking in the technical aspect of forest health, which is a shame as it is really a technical topic. "

            "\u00a0Expectations for assignments were not well communicated, and it would be useful if all assignments and deadlines were included on the syllabus from the start.\r\n\r\nMark did a great job facilitating discussions, and the opportunity to have dinner with some of the guest speakers was generous and engaging.\r\n\r\nTalbot, the other teacher, was the worst part of this course. His comments during class were arrogant, disrespectful, and did not facilitate student learning whatsoever. He also was not present at all during the end of the semester. I would highly recommend that future versions of this course bring him in for the insect ID workshop, and not again for the rest of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend spacing the presentations out over the first half of the semester. This restructuring would allow students to focus on a topic and then present on it prior to the midterm. Maybe this only occurs with insects and fungal pathogens, versus pollution, but I think it would be informative and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers were great. I felt like I benefited a lot from hearing from experts on various forest health issues, and on being able to join the experts for dinner and talk more casually with them afterwords. A workshop or two on field identification of forest health issues would have been very useful. Our final forest health assessments ended up being very focused on invasive plant species, even though they were not a main component of the course, which felt like a bit of a mismatch. I think that a field assessment of forest health is a useful activity, but this one felt somewhat disorganized and not as effective as it could have been. The discussion portion of the class was often frustrating, and didn't feel useful. I think the course could be improved by having fewer discussions, and/or having them targeted more specifically toward topics or management scenarios. They often felt directionless, and thus not very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Less discussion. We peaked 2 months into the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Better insect and fungus taxonomy workshops - need more structure, more concise but comprehensive literature (e.g., taxonomies) ",
            "\u00a0The strongest parts included: the trip to the USDA quarantine facility, and the weekly presenters. The weakest parts were: the overly long, not all that informative introductory classes for insects and fungi at the beginning, and then the weekly student-led discussions. I recommend: change the structure a little bit. Break each weekly 3-hour class into 2 shorter classes, one of which is a presentation (what the first half now is), the other of which is a field walk (even just in the nearby streets and arboretum, where many of these forest pests and pathogens' identification can readily be taught to students--e.g., HWA, EAB; ALB can be saved for the USDA quarantine facility; Chestnut Blight can be shown either out at the ag station or at YMF. I think the QCI forest health assessment is a really neat idea and I think there'd be a number of ways to work with this--perhaps narrow to just 1-2 landowners' properties per group, or requiring groups to head up to their properties one by one over the course of the semester? The fact sheets and 5-minute presentations were also really valuable, but I think these should have come halfway through the course, perhaps the week before a properly timed midterm, partly as a study tool. The midterm was valuable but should have happened much earlier, and the memorization of the various information (all of which is, to give Mark credit, necessary for managers) should have been woven more thoroughly into the course--e.g., on a weekly basis (field walks?). ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class was not conducive to learning about this subject.  This should not be a seminar.  There should be lectures with important information and management strategies.  The guest lecturers were very interesting, but they always felt auxiliary.  If possible, a substantial field component dealing with identifying and managing these pests would also be very useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to the topics and terminology relating to forest health, but doesn't really deep dive into the technical aspects. It would have been good if we spent a longer amount of time discussing those technical aspects and less time talking about the philosophy and theory behind the material.\r\n\r\nInstead of having half of every class devoted to open-forum student-led discussions, that mostly recycled the same discussed each week, we could have devoted 1.5 hours each week to a \"lab\" component. This could include activities in the field learning about identifying forest health issues and developing prescriptions, or looking at things in the laboratory under a microscope more in-depth. I think the fungal and insect workshops at the beginning of the semester were far too broad and not useful. It would be better to work through the information on a weekly basis, so we could really understand the identification of different pests/pathogens. "
