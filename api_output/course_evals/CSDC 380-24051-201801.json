            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Hollywood studios. The course has the word \"digital\" in the title, but the majority of the course was about the Golden Age of Hollywood, Talent Agencies, and the business models used in Hollywood. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history and current state of a movie system that is not very well known. It was really interesting to study what underpins much of the movie industry and how it is changing. I feel that I learned how to write a specific type of paper very well for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about how film studios make money, and the potential threats posed to their business model by streaming services. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of HOLLYWOOD history ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the current crises Hollywood faces and the history behind the major studios rise and struggles "

        [
            "\u00a0Although the actual information is quite interesting, I did feel as though it was taught too much as a lecture rather than a seminar. There were very few opportunities to participate and engage with other classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course structure. It is a seminar but it was more of a \"leminar.\" Students wrote 3 papers , gave a presentation, and acted in a debate. There is a lot of group work and grades. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - super interesting, lots of  new information, professor is very knowledgeable. A lot of side details are explored (music labels, etc) and it's very relevant to today's entertainment world. The studio presentation was a great project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not extremely conducive to classroom conversations, which was awkward when there was a debate at the very end. It would have been nice to \"practice\" conversations as a way to set up for the debate. Also, there ended up being significantly more essays than were announced at the beginning of the semester. The essays weren't impossible, but there was a lot more work than expected especially at the end of the semester when all other classes begin to assign more work as well. ",
            "\u00a0In class presentations felt a little unnecessary. Lectures, while fascinating, could run long, and the course would be improved by having more in class discussion as a part of each class meeting. ",
            "\u00a0Not a lot of opportunity to discuss and much more of a lecture ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting topic and syllabus, but I would have enjoyed more classwide discussion rather than lecturing. Besides more interactivity, I would loved to do the pitch excercise from the original syllabus "

        [
            "\u00a0I would but only if you are interested in the history of Hollywood studios. The class felt like a business course on Hollywood. If you are interested in entering the industry, you should definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if the student is a strong writer and sincerely enjoys movies. Otherwise, I would say no. Almost all work is graded based on essays and all the work encompasses learning about the behind the scenes of the movie and entertainment industry. You should also be at least mildly comfortable with speaking in public/presenting to a class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If its offered again! ",
            "\u00a0If you like lectures then yes, but only take the class if you genuinely really want to know basic Hollywood history ",
            "\u00a0A great class if youre interested in the filmmaking industry and want to discuss what makes films successful "
