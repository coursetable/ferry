            "\u00a0This course gave me essential knowledge about the history of the discipline of ethnic studies and the key ideas and theories that constitute the field. Professor Hosang emphasized analysis skill and the ability to read various texts in conversation with one another. I found the entire course to be very insightful. ",
            "\u00a0This course will give you a great understanding of the field of ethnic studies historically and today.  For some students it will be an extension of a lot of work they have already done in the major, but for others, such as myself, it will radically expand your understanding of power structure and subjugated knowledges in the United States. Regardless, it is a class to look forward to! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think deeply and critically about texts, both individually and collectively. The practice of producing new insight has been invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a foundational knowledge of thinkers and ideas in Ethnic Studies. Doing the reading responses every week really helped me to understand how to read texts together and put them in conversation with one another. Overall, it was helpful in understanding what the different strands of scholarship there are within Ethnic Studies and how they all interact with one another. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing!! I learned how to read at the next level in a way that my reading hasn't been pushed in a long time. I also learned how to synthesize texts to create new ideas that I know will be helpful going forward. I also developed a more complete understanding of ER&M as a discipline, and the topics covered that I hadn't been familiarized with in  ER&M classes that have a specific focus. I'm so thankful this class is the junior seminar because I feel like it really provides a fundamental basis for the major. I also loved the play (I seriously still think about it in an in-depth way and the questions it asks) and listening to Cat! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at policies with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really important for gaining an understanding of some of the foundational texts in ethnic studies. It also helped me write better, more original reading responses/papers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much by taking this course.  Not only did it give me the opportunity to connect with other Ethnicity, Race and Migration majors.  Professor HoSang not only provided a great course, with readings and discussion that gave us an opportunity to learn and grow, but he really pushed us in the course.  He reminded us that the work that we were learning about and wanted to do ourselves was important, radical and valuable.  To have a professor tell you that he thinks the things you think about and are focused on are worthy and valuable is no small thing, and I really appreciated that.  His pushing us in the course was not a directionless attempt to be hard, but rather an acknowledgement of the importance of the work and our own ability to do well, pushing us to think more deeply and work to do better.  I felt refreshingly challenged, supported and affirmed in my own skills and the importance of the things I believe in. "

            "\u00a0It's a fantastic course! It's essential to bring together all of the juniors in ER&M, and Hosang's class did a particularly strong job establishing the scholars, texts, and ideas that the course was based on. Another major strength was the Ethnic Studies Symposium with undergraduate presentations from students from more than 8 CT universities! The Symposium should definitely be replicated. The only improvement to the course might have been more opportunities for students to present within the class - either about their own research interests or about the course readings. ",
            "\u00a0Under Professor HoSang, this course was well organized and exceptionally well run. We had a really big class, which meant a lot of good perspectives but not always space for everyone to pariticiapte. I understand that this is being remedied in the future by having two sections. No complaints! ",
            "\u00a0This course was very rigorous and fast paced, as such it really challenged the limits of my capabilities. This was also the most well-organized class I have ever had the pleasure of taking, which deeply enriched my experience. The seminar was also incredibly dynamic, involving field trips, group work, presentations, and multi-media. The only way this course could be improved if it was smaller. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course was the size. The class size was too large for a seminar. However, Professor HoSang said this would be addressed next year. The syllabus was great, particularly the keywords essays. Another wonderful part of the class was the number of professors and other practitioners who came to class to speak about their work. It was great to hear from the writers what they thought about their own work and how it all came to together. I'd like to highlight especially Cat Rodrguez whose discussion of \"Father Comes Home From the War\" enriched and deepened my understanding of the play to a whole new level. ",
            "\u00a0Our major is getting bigger so it would be great to have two sections in the future!! Our seminar was a bit big this semester ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings and discussions are phenomenal, Professor HoSang and Randa are incredible!!!\r\nWeaknesses: On the posters on the last day of class I wrote I thought more varied writing assignments would be helpful, but now I'm not as sure since I realized how helpful they were for our final paper!! I think just having more feedback on the assignments would be helpful - maybe sharing them with a peer for several of the classes - I really enjoyed when we posted our shorter reading responses on canvas because it gave me context for how other people were thinking and engaging with materials. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the readings because it was very canonical. I did not much like the discussion because the class was so big. Both of the professors were incredibly intelligent and dedicated to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class size was way too big, and I didn't always feel comfortable participating because of that. Professor HoSang is great. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the way the course was organized and the emphasis that was placed on conceptually connecting the readings and gaining new insights based on your own thought process. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really great and intellectually stimulating, valuable course.  It was challenging but with a purpose, and I felt that the high standards Professor HoSang set really helped me improve my work in the course and in general.  Through the weekly reading responses which asked us to synthesize and put the readings in conversation with each other I could feel myself improving in my understanding of the concepts of the course, and my application of these concepts.  Through the very careful direction and support Professor HoSang and TF Randa Tawil offered on each response paper, I saw my own improved responses.  Having a course full of students who also had the same interests and were in the same major was great, and allowed us to work and grow with each other in a course that encouraged a lot of cooperation.  Not only was the course great for the academic material, but it taught me more about the valuable work of ethnic studies, and reaffirmed for me the reasons why I love the Ethnicity, Race and Migration major, for its commitment to important, vital and radical scholarship and activism.  It affirmed the students interests, in the classroom and in the world, and valued our work and expertise.  Through coordinating an ethnic studies symposium for students not just at Yale but from schools in Connecticut, the course really worked to put into practice the radical comparative ethnic studies it discussed, which was wonderful.

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor HoSang is incredible! He's engaging and really cares about his students. He approaches the content in a way that's interactive, engaging and understandable. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course! Required for any prospective ER&M majors, I'd recommend it to almost anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Youll have to take it as an ER&M major - I only wish everyone at Yale also had to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student, not just those in ER&M. It pushes students to think critically about the various institutions in which we find ourselves immersed as well as trends we often take for granted. This course offers you a range of perspectives on the world, and challenges you to interrogate your own. ",
            "\u00a0For a required class, I did not find it onerous or bothersome but instead a welcome challenge and an invitation to push myself as a practitioner of ER&M. The class is challenging but the material is immediate and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0YES - If you're in this course it's likely because you're a junior in ER&M, but this has actually been one of my top three favorite classes at Yale. The readings and discussion are so wonderful, and I had so many moments in this course where I was struck by the necessity, urgency and fundamental value of the work ER&M does and how it helps you think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because it gives you a beautiful foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. It is an excellent course that teaches you how to think ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  This was a great course for all of the Ethnicity, Race and Migration juniors to take together.  Because it was cooperative, we learned and worked with each other a lot, and I got to know some of the juniors in the major better, and appreciated how smart, talented and active all the other students were.  In addition, Professor HoSang is a great professor, and the TF, Randa Tawil was a really great and thoughful TF.  They put together a great syllabus and reading list that had a lot of important and valuable work on it across a variety of platforms, and I really appreciated the reading week by week.  It was such a clearly laid out and well structured course, and the weekly reading responses really pushed me to think about the reading and want to do the work really well.  Through guest speakers, the ethnic studies symposium the course organized and engagement at all of the cultural centers as well as each other, I know I learned so much in the course.  Lastly, the course affirmed us and students and scholars, telling us that the work we do and are interested in is valuable and necessary.  In a society that so often devalues the work of marginalized communities, to be told you and the things you are interested in are valuable, important and worthy of scholarship is a powerful thing, and this course was infused with this valuation through the coursework and the atmosphere the professor, TF and students created.  The course showed me why I love the Ethnicity, Race and Migration major even more, and it should be a course all Ethnicity, Race and Migration majors look forward to. "
