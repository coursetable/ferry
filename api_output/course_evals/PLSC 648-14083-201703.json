            "\u00a0It was hugely valuable to engage with such a wide variety of recent comparative theoretical work across regions. The syllabus helped me not only to get a substantive overview of recent debates in CPT, but also to engage with methodological controversies. Prof. von Vacano's own insights and guidance helped me to navigate the landscape of recent work with ease. "

            "\u00a0Prof. von Vacano worked with me to tailor the course syllabus to my primary interest in comparative political theory. He was very willing to work with me in one-on-one sessions and to provide substantive feedback on my written work. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend working with Prof. von Vacano. He is very knowledgeable about not only Latin American political theory, but about Euroamerican political thought (Nietzsche and Machiavelli in particular) and comparative political theory. He is flexible and kind, but also provides focused academic feedback. "
