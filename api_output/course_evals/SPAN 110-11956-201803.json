            "\u00a0An introduction to the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic Spanish, evident by the title of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. I can now read and comprehend a good deal of Spanish and carry out a basic conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a ton of Spanish vocab, grammar, and intuitions. I came in with no Spanish experience and Sonia was so supportive and helpful. I am honestly amazed at how much Spanish we were able to learn in one semester starting from the very beginning. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much higher level of competence with the Spanish language, much more than I expected given I had previously been using an app to learn. Whilst my writing and speaking hold some room for improvement, I am particularly pleased with my listening and comprehension. Overall, I am very satisfied by just being able to engage in conversations, and engage with communication, in the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in speaking, listening, and reading the Spanish language. By the end, I also found out my weaknesses (listening) and strengths (reading) in learning a new language. ",
            "\u00a0basic spanish skills and confidence speaking! ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to the most basic foundations of the Spanish language. I learned several verb tenses (present, present progressive, past, future) and hundreds of new vocab words. My Spanish speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills all grew significantly over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very challenging at first, but the process of speaking with my professor helped me to get a hold of what was required to do my best in the course. This was an important lesson to learn especially because it was my first semester. "

            "\u00a0The constant interaction with the material helped keep up the quick pace of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Its comprehensive and organized but it moves very quickly. Also, language learners with no prior background are expected to be at the same level as people whove taken Spanish in high school. ",
            "\u00a0The class size and meeting every day helped greatly with my learning. I would love it if the textbook was cheaper/students could print the Course Packet instead of going to Tyco. ",
            "\u00a0The course is amazing, especially with Sonia. There is class and homework everyday, but its really a good thing, because it allows you to stay on top of the material. I found that when it came to studying for exams, there wasn't much to study, because the classwork and homework we did everyday was a form of forced, continuous studying. I think this is super helpful for an intro language course. And Sonia is so amazing -- I couldn't have asked for a better first experience learning Spanish. There is clear feedback, the syllabus is detailed and organized, and you get to practice your oral and written skills everyday. ",
            "\u00a0I was clearly surprised by the workload and general intensity. I think that can be communicated in some detail upfront so that intending learners can be well prepared. Without that initial surprise, I will have gained even more from the course.\r\nI also think the detail that grading will entail should also be communicated. That will make students feel less discouraged by missing things like accent marks and such--which are nonetheless important.\r\nFeedback on problem areas improved towards the end of the class. It might help to start it sooner.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a great intense course that definitely gets you learning in a committed environment and gets you engaged from day one. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Valle is a fantastic instructor who helped students of all levels when coming into Spanish I. Though it was unnoticeable, her introduction and practicing of Spanish for her true-beginners versus students who have seen the language allowed for a rich learning experience. I did not have experience coming into the course and I never felt behind when compared to other students in the class. Also, I appreciated the structure of the course and how the course packet outlined the semester out from day 1.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of the semester, I did feel like topics were introduced at a much quicker rate than we were able to fully comprehend. Even though we were able to read and write about each new grammatical unit, we were not able to apply those concepts to our speaking and listening abilities just because there was not enough time to practice. Course materials were also a little bit expensive but overall, the strengths and learning really outweigh the weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Sonia is so nice and really engaged with her student's success.\r\n\r\ntextbook is very expensive and the supersite is not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Sonia is an incredible professor who makes an active effort to keep students engaged through interactive discussions and activities. The textbook readings and online exercises proved very helpful as well. I particularly liked the course's emphasis on the four primary language skills (reading, listening, writing, speaking). Looking back, I am proud of how much material I was able to grasp over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more vocab review in class. At times I felt that we were given 70 new words on Monday and expected to have them memorized by Tuesday. A bulk of class time is spent on grammar, which forces students to master the vocab almost entirely on their own time. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you need/want to take a language. Taking it with Sonia Valle was a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Spanish is a very useful language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is an amazing way to begin learning Spanish and you'll feel like you have learned a lot after a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great course and Sonia is an amazing professor. She is so kind, supportive, and funny. I learned so much Spanish, but the workload was nicely spread out. You do a bit everyday, but it is never overwhelming. And the small class size makes it a very supportive environment, even if you (like me) get a little embarrassed when you struggle with pronunciation. Overall, I recommend this course strongly! ",
            "\u00a0I certainly will.\r\nThere's great structure and helpful materials for learning the language. just be prepared from the outset to give the time it requires. If you don't start on the back foot, nothing to worry about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if it is with Professor Valle! I went into the course with an excitement to learn a new language and I did not feel it dwindle through the year. Even if you enter the class without a passion for Spanish, Professor Valle does create an environment where you feel like you belong and am improving each day. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if they want to learn spanish! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I was a bit nervous at first because I literally knew zero Spanish going in, but I am beyond grateful that I stuck with it. Sonia in particular was an amazing professor, so try to get into her section if possible. This was probably my favorite class this semester. "
