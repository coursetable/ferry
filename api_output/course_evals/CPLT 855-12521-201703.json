            "\u00a0This course helped me to isolate and articulate the different notions of the \"global\" that are encoded within modernist fiction and the different ways in which these notions are made manifest in their respective texts. The reason for the focus upon modernism, I suspect, is the uptick in literary sharing between the metropolitan centers in Europe and the United States and the colonial peripheries across the Global South that began in the 20th century as a response to widespread decolonial struggles in the 19th century (and, in the case of Ireland, continuing into the 20th). While I had been previously introduced to notions of postcoloniality and a colonial literary identity, I had not been introduced to the ongoing debate around world literature and world literary systems, and this exposure has proved to be immensely helpful in helping me to understand my own critical position in the context of contemporary scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal from Professor Cleary's class about approaching and critically assessing modernist texts. As a student who does not specialize in any way with this period or its criticism, I was given tools to begin to comprehend and interpret some very difficult reading. I was also given some great ideas on how to approach my own work, which parallels many of the themes we discussed in class, albeit 600 years earlier or so. ",
            "\u00a0I hadnt taken any courses previously that focused on the specific relationship between modernism and realismtheir points of overlap, their divergences, and how their definitions changed at different times and in different placesso I found it very helpful to examine them in tandem. The bedrock of the course seemed to be the theoretical readings, which were new to me and will be very valuable moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0Before this course, I had a very basic grasp of \"modernism\" and now I have a firmer foundation of these large terms: modernism, realism and imperial crisis. I read important literary texts and theory that will most definitely aide in my further studies. ",
            "\u00a0I had familiarity with a few of the texts on the syllabus, but this course approached them from a completely different angle. I gained a greater understanding of the impact of colonialism on modernist literature, as well as new skills for reading and applying critical theory (with which I was not terribly familiar). ",
            "\u00a0By almost seamlessly interweaving primary and secondary texts, this course really helped me develop my ability to read primary works (and especially fiction) within a more contextualized literary plane. It also made me more aware of the importance of studying the political and sociological intentions and meanings of works, rather than focusing mainly on their style. It provided me with interesting and useful insights into the complex political systems and tensions that gave rise to the texts we studied during the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0My main intention in taking this course was to be able to articulate what we refer to when we say \"Modernism\" as literary scholars. I believe that learning goal was achieved, in that I understand the development of Modernism as an artistic movement and ideology. Also, I learned more theoretical issues to questions about the intersection between history, memory, and literature which will probably be the insights from the course that will most impact my future scholarship.

            "\u00a0I think the chronological construction of the course was a very intelligent pedagogical framework that allowed me to follow the syllabus as something like a narrative of my own learning. My only criticism of the syllabus would be in its last two novels. While Duras and Truong were enjoyable to read, they did not fit the narrative of the course particularly well, since both were writing about a French colonial situation in Southeast Asia, and, up until that point, the course was focused mostly upon the English colonial situation in the Western Hemisphere. I feel like both novels could be easily substituted for a writer like Derek Walcott, who, while being a poet, is still a very accomplished storyteller and might have tied back to Conrad, Joyce, and James in a much clearer fashion. (I understand that James writes about the French colonial situation in the Western Hemisphere, but he does it for a British audience, and our discussion of audience was particularly strong around The Black Jacobins; I feel that it would have continued more fluidly and naturally with someone like Walcott though not necessarily him). Our collective intellectual response as a seminar to Duras and Truong was significantly weaker than to those texts which had preceded theirs. While some of this is certainly owing to end-of-semester burn-out, I think it is fair to suggest that some of it is owing, also, to the possibility that The Lover and The Book of Salt simply have less to offer intellectually than the course's other works of fiction. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an incredible survey. Professor Cleary was very comprehensive in his reading list, his proposed themes, and his overall pedagogy. Class was always well-organized, and the conversation always fruitful. I learned a great deal from the reading material alone, and Professor Cleary always gave great initial remarks before we jumped in. The reading was heavy, but I really enjoyed it and did not find it to be too much. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great course overall, and Joe Cleary is likewise a great professor to be teaching it. I had not been expecting it to be quite as rooted in theory as it was, but that isnt a bad thing at all: Im glad to have had the opportunity to read Lukcs, for example, and feel I learned a lot. I also appreciated the courses transnational scope and found it to be much more helpful than just examining developments within one national literary tradition.\r\n\r\nFor me, the course was most compelling when it was most explicitly historical and social. If I were to make changes to the syllabus, Id probably try to accent this, and wonder if framing the readings this way to a greater degree would make the the novels and the theory on the syllabus link up better. The Lukcs readings, for instance, were most useful to me when we considered why Lukcs is grounded in a particular time and place, and why certain definitions of/opinions about realism, modernism, etc. didnt align with those of his non-Soviet contemporaries. I didn't find it quite as helpful to think about whether a given novel on the syllabus fit into Lukcs's theoretical model.\r\n\r\nI felt that we asked similar historical questions about some of the novels on the course (The Lover comes to mind), but not all, and wish we could have thought more about this with Conrad and Garca Mrquez in particular. I guess I would have liked to spend more time thinking historically about the gatekeepers of these theoretical and literary texts: the editors, publishers, institutions, translators, and transnational networks (both literary and more broadly political) that shaped them, and, in turn, shaped the evolving global dialogue about modernism and realism in the 20th century. This framing was where the course really came together for me, and I would have liked to see it emphasized more strongly.\r\n\r\nThe only part of the class I found somewhat frustrating was the Canvas responses. They were helpful in terms of making me think deeply about the readings, but writing three or four responses every week took up a lot of hours. (I dont think the professor realized or intended this.) I might have preferred to submit just one or two responses on a weekly basis, with the expectation that theyd be a bit more polished than the three to four weekly responses required this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Cleary truly created a supportive environment for growth and learning. The use of blackboard was also very effective to allow each person a space to participate and think about the texts in a \"non-graded\" space. The course reading list was wonderful and allowed for a deep and meaningful seminar. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a few weeks where the seminar discussion never made it through the theory and the primary text for that particular week. I know the time is very limited but I think in some of those moments it might have been helpful to adjust the reading for the following week to ensure that we hit the important notes of each text we read. ",
            "\u00a0The novels selected for the syllabus were all engaging, fascinating works, and the critical theory was well selected to accompany the primary texts. However, I wish we had had more time to discuss the novels themselves; often class began with discussion of the criticism and left little time to talk about the literature. I think it would be more effective to begin with discussion of the novels before incorporating the secondary readings; this would have allowed us an opportunity to spend more time on the novels as well as giving us a stronger foundation for the discussion of the criticism. No one loves writing reading responses, but I think the prompts given were actually very helpful in organizing my thinking about the works. Otherwise, I thought the course was effectively designed and well taught. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there is very little to improve with respect to this course. I enjoyed the selection of material, and believe that it consisted of a very good amount of texts. I did not mind that we had to rush through some of the texts (Joyce and Mrquez come to mind most), because I think that this particular course gained a lot from its wide range and capaciousness. If there was one thing I would perhaps like to see more of, it would be a more intense study of style, and of the reasons why the techniques of modernism, realism, and magical realism were so important in the political contexts studied. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the strengths of the course were the flexibility of the syllabus to explore the literature freely in class discussions as well as the pre-class responses (which were incredibly useful for articulating some of the more complicated ideas and questions I encountered in the texts). One weakness was that there was very little discussion about the text specifically and instead the conversations seemed to circulate the text rather than confront it. Also, including theoretical works in the middle of the syllabus seemed to disrupt the flow among the novels and I would have preferred to read more novels alongside the theory as the semester went on. "

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think it is the kind of course that has been carefully designed to offer each student unique and applicable information that they had yet to encounter. We had a very diverse field of interests around our seminar table, and I was struck, in each conversation that I had with my colleagues, by how variegated and diverse our responses were to each set of readings. I suppose that because the class's focus is upon the politics and aesthetics of coloniality and world literature, and an underlying formalist question as to the level of realism in modernism, there is enough very hardy intellectual fare for the syllabus to make unique contributions to each student's thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would especially recommend it to a student who is terrified of modernism and needs a gentle yet challenging hand in approaching the period and its texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it's a solid and helpful survey of some key issues surrounding global modernisms and realisms in the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would and have recommended this course to other students. It is a foundational course spanning the birth and decline of modernism that I think every grad student studying English literature should spend some time grappling with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved the syllabus and Professor Cleary was a wonderful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved the selection of texts, and think that they provide a wonderful grounding in the prose of modernism. I think that they also interact with a very important set of political and social concerns, that are as relevant for the study of the 21st century as the are for the 20th. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about Modernism, genre theory, history of the 20th century via literature, or world literature. "
