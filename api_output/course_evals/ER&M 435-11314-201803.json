            "\u00a0This class developed my thinking around processes of academia. I also learned a lot of varied information about the history of Native America. More than anything, this class changed how I understand the creation and telling of stories. ",
            "\u00a0I gained perspective on how to put primary and secondary sources into conversation for a lengthy end-of-term research paper. The class focuses primarily on building up a foundation to write a research paper. The readings we completed revealed the degree to which decolonizing processes still need fleshing out. Humbling to gain exposure to the continued challenges and experiences of the Native American community (had no previous coursework in this area). ",
            "\u00a0Despite the fact that the course was called \"Writing Tribal Histories,\" we learned very little about the ethnographic skills of writing such pieces. The class was more of a modern native American history class, and it covered a pretty wide range of topics. We did read some fantastic primary source tribal histories, but I wouldn't say I gained the skills of writing one. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about researching, writing, and discussing tribal histories across indigenous North America. ",
            "\u00a0There are a variety of ways to write tribal histories. One way is to tell history through biographies of important people relevant to the story being told. Oral history is sometimes, or most times perhaps, the best primary source. An important thing to remember is that a researcher needs to respect their interviewees. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty straightforward, we thought a lot about methodologies and challenges of writing tribal histories. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful class. Topic was obviously something generally under-discussed in many Yale courses, and this course put Native history front and center. I learned how to better read Native histories, evaluate them, and consider the impacts of who wrote it, why they wrote it, etc. on understanding the text. ",
            "\u00a0AMST 422 allowed me the opportunity to develop my research and writing abilities to a level I had not previously known to be possible. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned about how to write histories and critically read them. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The topic and structure of the class are well devised. I wish we read more texts that strictly spoke to Indigenous methodology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: ample assistance and focus on writing a research paper, interesting weekly readings written by Native American authors\r\nWeaknesses: occasional lack of direction/coherence in seminar discussions ",
            "\u00a0We spent far too much time (at least the last five sessions) on in-class presentations. While in-class presentations are valuable experiences, it felt like a waste of five classes. The course would be improved if the presentations were limited to the last one or two sessions. ",
            "\u00a0N/A, as an auditor, it's difficult for me to answer this. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength is the sheer range of topics in Native American history covered and the insight provided by guest speakers. One weakness is that discussion can become off topic at times, but usually it ends up being interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Blackhawk is great, and really engaged in working with students to improve their writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assumed a relatively high level of knowledge of American Indian history, but nothing that a quick google search couldn't fix. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that we had a lot of control over what class time was spent doing. For example, if we were assigned 100 pages of reading one week, we could choose to have an in depth discussion on 10-20 pages rather than a broad survey of the whole section. However, I think we stopped reading too early in the semester in order to move on to our research projects. ",
            "\u00a0True to the spirit and culture of Yale College, Dr. Blackhawk provided students in AMST 422 with the opportunity to take their learning a step further by providing incredible excursions to such events as the Metropolitan Museum's invitation-only Opening Night of the Art of Native America: A Charles and Valerie Diker Collection and speaker events with renowned American Indian scholars. ",
            "\u00a0Great reading list and great discussions "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, it is vital in the recognition and understanding of non-European style histories.  The professor is also great, he really works to develop students' understandings through class discussion as well as personal anecdotes and stories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for a student interested in Native American history and who would like to develop his/her research and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting, but don't take it if you're looking to build your ethnography skills. Despite the fact that the course was called \"Writing Tribal Histories,\" we learned very little about the ethnographic skills of writing such pieces. The class was more of a modern native American history class, and it covered a pretty wide range of topics. We did read some fantastic primary source tribal histories, but I wouldn't say I gained the skills of writing one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Prof. Blackhawk is a phenomenal teacher and the research project of the course was an awesome opportunity to learn more about a topic that interests you. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an amazing start for a senior thesis. I know a couple of my friends who have used a large chunk of the research done in this class and applied it to their capstone. The paper is actually not too bad, especially if you start early. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you're a history major, it's very helpful for improving research/writing abilities. As the course is pretty methodology-based, you won't learn a ton about American Indian history, but if you already have a knowledge base of the field/ are willing to do a little bit of reading on your own do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, anyone (esp. history majors) wanting a course that isn't run-of-the-mill and will introduce one, or potentially two new topics (Native history as well as historiography in general) should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student.  Any course taught by Dr. Blackhawk is a course worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, even (especially) for students without a background in Native American history. Professor Blackhawk is hilarious, learned, and very supportive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this course because it allows you to focus on your own interest in relationship to indigenity. Professor Blackhawk is a terrific advisor as a famous professor who is highly knowledgeable of American Indian history. The majority of the course involves a long-term research project on your own topic and using classroom discussions and readings to inform your work. Take this class if you want the freedom to write about your passion with a top-notch advisor in Native Studies. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course! You read incredible books and Professor Blackhawk gives great advice and feedback on papers. "
