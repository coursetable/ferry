            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the fundamentals of field theory and Galois theory, and I gained a lot of skill in writing proofs and thinking about abstract concepts in math. ",
            "\u00a0Standard topics for a Galois theory class. ",
            "\u00a0We began by learning the basics of fields and field structure (field extensions, subfields). After working through a set of intermediary subjects, the punchline of the class concerned the fundamental theorem of Galois theory and solvability by radicals. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from teaching you the basics of group and field theory, this course teaches you how to apply the material learned in Math 350. More broadly, it teaches you how to think abstractly and approach problem solving in algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Reinforced some concepts from abstract algebra like solvability and field theory; good intro to Galois theory that culminated in solvability by radicals "

            "\u00a0It was a very good course. I think that the major proofs could have been more emphasized; sometimes they felt rushed and not fleshed out properly. ",
            "\u00a0The course was rather disorganized. While the material was engaging, I felt that Asher was often unprepared for lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think the course can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very strong course. It was very intense and difficult but was incredibly interesting, well-taught, and was well-structured. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting, professor Auel moves at a good pace and is always ready to answer questions. The psets were usually pretty interesting and provided more insight into the material covered in class ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that the class was not structured around a textbook. This allowed us to explore the occasional alternative subject, like the Newton polygon. I have no legitimate complaints about the class. ",
            "\u00a0In general I found the course to be very good---it was engaging, interesting, and I learned a lot. However, I think personally that the course could have moved through material a little faster and covered more. ",
            "\u00a0Had a solid textbook and very helpful - if long - homework exercises, with plenty of office hours for support. The grading scheme was also very fair (could weight better exams more heavily). The pacing was a little inconsistent at certain points as it felt like we spent longer on certain concepts in the beginning, so we had a good foundation, but some later topics were rushed through. I felt like a little more time spent introducing the fundamental theorem of Galois theory would have been helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would, strongly. It was fascinating, challenging, and very rewarding. I enjoyed it a lot. It is a tough course, so they have to be engaged and willing to learn. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, especially if it were still taught by Prof. Auel. But even given that it will not be in the future, I think the material is very interesting and that it would be a good class under most professors. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I think the class introduced some very cool concepts and had a bunch of fun proofs in class and on homework. The homework is as expected really time consuming but manageable, and grading is generous. "
