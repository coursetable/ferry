            "\u00a0This was a topic I didn't know much about at all; I think I gained a rather well-rounded, if preliminary, idea of the history and current opinion on evolution, anthropology, and archaeology in Africa, as well as the social implications and uses of these theories and practices outside of the Western scope. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about human origins and how it relates to Africa. It was interesting to talk about archeology and origin research in Africa. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a broad variety of topics related both directly and tangentially to human origins research on the African continent. Topics covered included African identity, Animism and African traditional religious systems, the role of museums (both in Africa and abroad) in telling the stories/histories of Africa and human origins, simianisation in Europe and in Africa, and cultural/heritage landscapes. The course was designed to be highly discursive and allowed for critical investigation into the way that Africa has been perceived in the past and is perceived in the present, the role of nationalist archaeology in creating post-colonial African state identities, and what the \"out of Africa\" theory of human origins means for African states and peoples. "

            "\u00a0The course seemed a little disorganized, dealing with a wide range of topics, but I actually enjoyed the low-key learning vibe. It made it much easier to bond with fellow students, and offered a welcome contrast to the highly structured, often impersonal and cold, STEM and other classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was small because it meant that we could have more flexible conversations about the class content and could really focus on the topics that interested us. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in Dr. Waweru's connection to the material and her agency to dynamically alter the focus of the material as the course progressed. ",
            "\u00a0The discursive structure of this course allowed for thorough critical investigation of the ways in which perceptions of Africa have developed over time and the input of different students gave a diversity of perspectives to the discussion. The freedom in choice of essay topic and the essay presentations at the end of the semester allowed students to particularly take on an area of interest to them and research it in depth, resulting in greater independence in the learning process that was an excellent way to engage directly with the major \"questions\" the course posed, and genuine sharing of knowledge and experience between students of different backgrounds. \r\nThe objectives of the course and its \"main theme\" could have been made clearer at the beginning of the semester as at the beginning it was somewhat unclear what the learning objective of the course was and what would be expected of students. A more concise course title and clearer outline of the topics to be covered (and their relationship to the human origins \"theme\" of the course) would perhaps have helped students to understand from the outset what the scope of the course would be. \r\nSometimes the starting discussion question seemed to be a bit of a \"leading question\" - although this was quickly remedied by a very open discussion allowing for different perspectives and the addition of related questions that probed the problem more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0A very intimate setting due to its seminar structure but there could be more discussion styles added to ensure that everyone participates moree. "

            "\u00a0Yes: even (especially) if this is not your field of expertise, it is a really fun way to have meaningful group discussions in a safe space that is intellectually invigorating and challenging without being threatening. Dr. Waweru is incredibly knowledgable, but doesn't preach to the class; the balance between lecture and seminar is very easy-going, and it is very easy to feel comfortable with expressing your thoughts about this genuinely interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its an interesting introduction to the topic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Coming from a background with little experience of material in the ER&M field, I found that I was exposed to a wide range of topics that greatly broadened my understanding of the subject area. I'd very much recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It offers a genuinely new perspective on the perceptions of Africa and Africans both on and outside of the continent, tied to the theme of human origins research. Professor Waweru is very knowledgeable in her field and has extensive experience of working on archaeological digs on the African continent, and is thus able to contribute a valuable first-hand expert perspective on the topic. However, despite her experience, she does not dominate the classroom or focus too heavily on lecture, which allows for plenty of open discussion. This facilitates critical independent thinking and the consideration of perspectives from across diverse perspectives represented in the classroom. This class has fundamentally changed the way I see and think about African identity, how it has been formed over time, and what human origins research in Africa means for the people of the continent, in ways I had never considered before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it takes an intersectional approach to issues in evolution and archaeology in a way thats accessible to people who have no background in those areas. "
