            "\u00a0This course made me think differently about conceptions and state-sanctioned uses of the border; illegality, legal invisibility, criminalization, and erasure; intersectional identities and migration; the power of words to reflect and shape someone's identity and experiences; advocacy, activism, justice, and rights. I will be thinking for a while about all I learned in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to talk about migration, borders, and citizenship from the perspective of migrants. I learned about the construction of illegality, the different ways the framework of the nation-state and citizenship limit our personal freedoms, and learned about the injustices and violence perpetuated against migrants. \r\n\r\nI learned how to develop a syllabus to be shared and distributed to the public. \r\n\r\nI learned how to talk about documentaries, film, poetry, and art as it relates to migrant justice. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a useful introduction to approaches and problems in migration studies. ",
            "\u00a0The Migrant Justice Initiative course was extremely useful for me to consider how in my own work I will adopt a migrant centered approach. The topics we covered in class, from queer migrations to discussions on the migrant caravans, helped me think about how current issues around migration, asylum, and the carceral state are tied to larger histories and global forces. ",

            "\u00a0The content was well curated and really interesting to read and discuss, especially with a group of students who had extensive backgrounds in topics related to migration. The hardest thing about this course was sometimes not knowing the reading assignments for the next week earlier in the week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is timely. Due to the ongoing migration crisis and the stiffening of borders around the world, this class is important and necessary for people to understand how these systems of human categorization harm everyone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the lack of institutional and administrative support of the ER&M program, it was often quite stressful to be engaged and invested in a course that your own University leadership does not recognize as significantly imperative. ",
            "\u00a0N/a ",
            "\u00a0I liked the fact that this was a small course where all students had a chance to speak. The reading selections and the incorporation of films, documentaries, and other types of media also was extremely useful to think about how the topics we covered are being discussed outside of academic spaces and disseminated to the public. However, I wish there would have been more structure around our final projects. I would have liked to have everyone in the class workshop their final project to see what every student is working on. This would have also been helpful in getting each of us to think about our projects earlier in the semester. ",

Having the ability to explain migration, its causes, effects, and misconceptions is important in today's world where right-wing authoritarian governments are limiting mobility and movement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for the opportunity for group discussion and collaboration ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the Migrant Justice course to any student interested in questions of migration, citizenship, and borders. Not only were the readings and discussions for this course engaging, but Alicia is such a great instructor that students should not miss the opportunity to get to work with her in a seminar space. ",
