Even if I'm gonna be very picky I have nothing but my full appreciation for that.\r\n\r\nThe only and minor part is for the TFs, I think I often received emails from them to say that their office hours changed, probably at least once a week from different TFs. Though it didn't affect me but probably in the future there could be more commitment to the set-up schedule. "
