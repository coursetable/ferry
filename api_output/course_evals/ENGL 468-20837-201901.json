            "\u00a0I produced a full-length play in one semester. I learned the technical aspects of structuring a play and thinking about character development, event of a play, and various ways to break all theater rules. ",
            "\u00a0This course transformed the way I approach writing. Having to bring in and present material every week forces you to develop a consistent writing schedule. Honestly this discipline is probably the most valuable thing the course will give you. You will also get lots of feedback from Professor Margulies and your classmates, so you'll have practice reconciling sometimes contradictory notes and figuring out which ones to take. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course, designed to teach you how to write a full length play. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a wild ride. I have never worked so hard on a creative project before in my life. This was especially rigorous because I have never written a play before in my life, let alone a full-length play (80-120 pages). This class taught me invaluable lessons about how I work, how I think, how I fail, and the effort it takes to complete a full-length piece of drama. There is truly no such thing as a final product: the true joy and fulfillment comes from the arduous and frustrating process of playwriting. ",
            "\u00a0Having never taken a playwriting class before, this class was my first major introduction to both writing and reading plays. We read fantastic, mostly contemporary playwrights, in a really considered order and fashion - for example, focusing on the idea of a 'proto-play' for the first few weeks. I learned techniques/tools of writing itself, and learned a lot from the other students in the class since we all workshopped our writing every week. "

            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in the nature of the course: a small selection of students (6) with plenty of time for rigorous workshop every week. Bringing in ten pages every week helped us keep on track to turn in a full length draft by the end of the semester. It was helpful that we were given prompts in the beginning to get our creative juices flowing, but once we realized what we wanted to write about, we were free to bring in whatever pages we wanted. I also deeply enjoyed the structure of the syllabus--every week typically featured 2-3 plays from the same playwright written at different times of their lives. It's fascinating to see how the same themes they grappled with at a young age were tackled with more finesse as they progressed in their careers. I appreciate the wide variety of plays--it really showed me how theater can take so many different forms. One of the coolest parts of the semester was when Professor Margulies invited us to NYC to his table read of his play, Long Lost. It was so fun being in the room watching the actors and directors hard at work. It would have been cool to invite established playwrights to talk to our class, or have more fieldtrips like that. ",
            "\u00a0The workshop format of the class works really well. Professor Margulies will also give you his clear opinions and is not afraid to hold back. The plays we read in class can be influential, but we only spend 30 minutes max discussing them each week, and given the amount of time spent on the \"talking points\" before class they can be pretty reductive takes on what could be deeper discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a very set pattern, where you read two plays every week, analyse them, and then present your own writing, which ended up predominately being segments from each of our plays. I think it would have been beneficial to focus more on writing prompts, which we did at the beginning of the semester, but overall it was focused on the full length play we wrote, which was definitely helpful/probably necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more time spent on analyzing the different plays we were assigned to read for this class. I also would appreciate maybe a kind of check-in point during the semester where we could get sort of an overview on how we were performing? Otherwise, the class was truly remarkable. ",
            "\u00a0Being able to workshop our writing every week was fantastic. Also, the number of plays we read was perfect; enough to be a fairly immersive reading experience, but not so many that we couldn't focus sufficiently on each play. The only way the class could be improved is some more guidance on which scenes might need attention/writing earlier on, so that there is less risk of ending up with a series of unconnected scenes and little over-arching plot/connection towards the end of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Note that it is a lot of work however; reading two plays a week and writing a page of notes as well as 7-15 pages of your own play every week can be quite demanding. Make sure you have good time management so you don't fall behind on those pages. This class will really shape you as a writer (and as a feedback giver as you are an active participant in giving feedback to your classmates)! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, but I think you have to be mentally prepared to write a full length play. It will help if you have an idea going in. If you end up choosing something you're not too excited about, and then run out of time in the semester to change it, it can be hard to motivate yourself to continue writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The chance to take any class with Donald Margulies is a life-changing experience you will not forget. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a small, focused class with a brilliant professor and TA, and talented other students. It was also welcoming and accessible to complete novices like myself. "
