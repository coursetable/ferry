            "\u00a0I learned how to be a better writer through class sessions and in reading other students' work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole lot about writing and a whole lot about myself as a writer. Both are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better writer and gained confidence in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class that I've taken at Yale, and Anne is the most effective writing professor I've ever encountered. Every writing professor has their set of tips and tricks, which all have odd names, but the difference with Anne is that they really work. As the semester went on, I could feel my own writing sharpen, and I could see my classmates' writing grow, too. Anne's impact was obvious. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to read with an eye to craft. Anne did an excellent job guiding our class discussions so that we would always notice some element of the pieces we had read for that weekthe beginning, the ending, the sentence structure, the varying focal length, the use of humor, etc.and I found that those discussions, too, improved my writing and reading immensely. \r\n\r\nAlsothis class is just inspiring. I so admired my classmates, and their writing, and it was such a privilege to get to read their work. I finished the semester feeling so excited about writing, and about Yale, because of the people that I had met through this class. If you want to improve your writing, and if you want to work hard at it, there's no better class that you could take. "

            "\u00a0The course is well organized and engaging on all counts. The only weakness was how Anne seemed to regard students as one-dimensional based on how she addressed them and comments she made in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A highly structured lecture, seminar, and workshop all in one. Annes dedication and expertise. A small class with ample exchange of ideas and critiques. The freedom to write on just about any subject. \r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement: I would suggest starting the final essay earlier and having more scaffolding around it. I think that the length and depth of the essay deserves more time, and perhaps another short conference with Anne. ",
            "\u00a0The course's particular strengths include its attention to detail in writing and the wonderful sense of writerly community. ",
            "\u00a0Again, this class is the strongest class I've taken at Yale. Anne has clearly spent hours and hours painstakingly designing this class so that she uses every second of our time together efficiently. I loved the way that classes were broken into author reports, reading discussions, other random lessons, and workshops. I thought the overall arc of the class over the semester was excellent, and I thought it was the exact right amount of structure. I thought the critiques that we wrote about each other's pieces were really helpfulboth the writing and receiving of the critiquesand it was such a pleasure to work with the other people in this class (and spend more time appreciating their writing). And, of course, the hour-long, one-on-one conferences that Anne schedules with each person were my favorite part of the classAnne was always so prepared to comment and line-edit. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed WaO, but I would say that if youre interested in taking this course, please do consider the workload pretty seriously. There are a lot of moving parts, and it can feel overwhelming if youre not staying on top of your work. Other than that, its a lovely courseAnne offers great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students. One thing that I feel most people do not seem to share about Anne as an instructor in evaluations: she has the tendency to put people in boxes. Over the course of the semester based on how she references people and talks to them in class and in individual meetings it will seem as though she seems them as one-dimensional, only known for one thing or skilled in one thing whether its an academic interest, extracurricular involvement, or quirk fact. This can be incredibly frustrating coupled with how she tends to dominate class sessions with her opinion. This is something to watch out for. I still enjoyed her class because I learned a lot about writing and reading texts for the craft. ",
            "\u00a0You should absolutely take Writing About Oneself if you have the chance. This is not a class where you read articles and extol or decry the writing with no end (some seminars I have taken followed this format). Instead, we discuss *why* good writing works, with real skills and mechanics that will be applicable to nearly anything you write in the future. We also discuss the ethics and complexities of our writers, and of the writing endeavor itself. You will have your essays closely read and edited by Anne and by your peers, who are an incredibly interesting and varied group. \r\n\r\nA word of advice: I recommend making WaO your only writing course of the semester  otherwise, you may be spread too thin. And if you are motivated by grades, take it Credit/D/Fail. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anybody who gets a chance to take it! ",
            "\u00a0It's the best writing course I've taken at Yale, and I've taken more than a few. It's a lot of work, but it's work that will make you an infinitely better writer. I think reports of the class as a \"cult\" are a bit overblown; it's only competitive and exclusive if you make it that way. ",
            "\u00a0This is, hands down, the best class that I've taken at Yale. Anne is a remarkable professorshe really does improve your writing (not a little, a lot) and she cares so much about every single student. I was also blown away by the other students who took the class with me. The class is beautifully structured. You get to tackle tough, satisfying assignments and wonderful readings. The only caveat: Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to give it your all. This class is a lot of work, and it's so much richer, and so much more rewarding, if you have space in your life to pour yourself into it. But you do have space in your life, and I can tell you that it is worth it. You will grow as a writer, as a reader, and as an editor. You will get to spend time with a wonderful group of students. And you'll get to learn from one of the most gifted, inspiring professors at Yale. "
