            "\u00a0I really enjoyed most of the sessions but some discussions were more lively than others and more relevant to certain members of the group than others. But I'm not sure that this is something that can be changed about the course. I especially enjoyed the session on academic writing - the article was very thought provoking and the discussion interesting and helpful - and the first few sessions. These were helpful across my other courses. "
