            "\u00a0Very few skills or insights - I did learn that global history courses often offer very limited depth of field in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to the history of many different parts of the world in the year 1000. Also good practice for writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a lot about world history and making connections between civilizations. ",

            "\u00a0None ",
            "\u00a0I have greatly developped my geographical knowledge of civilisations in the year 1000. I also found the idea that globalisation actually began in the year 1000 to be fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to analyze different historical sources and write from different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0World History (mostly Eurasian history) around the year 1000. Some parts of the class, such as the interactions between Asia and the Islamic world seemed to be important and little-taught elsewhere, and also influential in the history of the world. Other parts of the course however, seemed to fall into more of a \"fun facts\" category, such as our focus on the \"vikings\" in the maya murals. ",
            "\u00a0In The World Circa 1000, we explored deeply societies that are very dissimilar to those that we usually study in history classes (i.e. Modern and Classical Europe). After studying these primitive cultures, I think differently and with a more open mind about social structures and power dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a look at the world in the year 1000. We discussed social, religious, and cultural trends. We specially focused on six different interactions of different people groups around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a perspective on how to analyze history generally from multiple perspectives. I was able to do so, because this courses looks at history during a certain time period across the world. Usually when studying history there are certain traits and characteristics you look out for when analyzing evidence, but because all the places are so different you get a decent foundation on how to analyze multiple sources from different parts of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Not much was gained from this course besides the fact that globalization technically \"started\" in the year 1000 simply because people were giving items to each other. This course was just a bunch of random information from different parts of the world jammed into several powerpoints with no particular coherence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write history papers and create cross-regional comparisons through primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I did learn some interesting world history. "

            "\u00a0One key strength is that the workload is very customizable, which is extremely beneficial to the students. One key weakness is lack of words on the prepared powerpoints explaining the pictures/slides. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the \"one paper before October Break\" requirement which saved me from myself. If not for that requirement I would have ended up cramming two papers in between my second midterms for other classes. \r\n\r\nOne definite weakness was the timing of information and the paper deadlines. Sections, which I had on Wednesdays at 7PM, often included information pertinent to the papers due at midnight that night. It was also one of the only times to get in person feedback on any drafts of your papers. This meant that I was often forced to heavily revise my papers in the 4 hours before the deadline. This unfortunate timing issue could be solve simply by moving the paper deadlines slightly, to Thursday or Friday night. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps don't teach it again, or re-form the course to have some overarching themes.  Definitely rethink the thesis of the 'year 1000' because it makes little sense and the evidence is unconnected and has little actual meaning that the professor has not clearly assigned to it.  I learned so little about so many of the topics covered that I cannot say I actually garnered any understanding of a region or theme in the course, despite doing all the readings, going to all the sections and lectures, and spending large amounts of time on both papers and studying for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course is structured so that little value is given to understanding the material with any depth. It is very cursory and is more interested in proving its thesis and providing a smattering of facts than in developing the fruitful threads that come up along the way. Lectures often felt aimless and disjointed. Still, the idea seems to have a lot of potential. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness.... final exam material was not 100% aligned with material in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging lectures and sections. Final exam was not well structured to evaluate knowledge/engagement in my opinion ",
            "\u00a0You don't always feel like you're learning very relevant information. The lectures are generally clear, which is nice, I just found it hard to personally motivate myself to care about the information taught. ",
            "\u00a0A really big weakness of this course is the poor organization. Throughout the course I had no idea what was happening and could not find connections between what I was learning, what I was reading for homework, and what we went over in section. I only understood everything after studying a really long time for the final. I also think the assignments were poorly planned. We should not have had essays due on Wednesday when we only learned about the material on Monday and Wednesday. Also since the sections were on Wednesday, it was vey poor planning to only give students a few hours to revise their essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers several interesting readings and illuminates aspects of a time period rarely discussed. However, I found several of the lectures very incompatible with the subject at hand, and thus unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-lectures \r\nWeaknesses-organization or material and clarity of significance between themes ",
            "\u00a0Fix section to be earlier in the week and have  amore organized curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- breadth of areas covered, interesting but uncommonly taught time in history, both professors are great lecturers, structure of the short paper assignments being able to choose 2 was great, TA's were great and section felt worthwhile. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Secondary source readings were dense, never discussed, and tested on the final, Guest lectures, while interesting and well done, were mostly irrelevant to the rest of the course, too much time spent in Europe at the beginning of the course. Having papers due the same day as section (especially editing our final papers in section the day they were due) created quick turnaround times. ",
            "\u00a0This course and all the others at this school are too strict when it comes to essay-writing rules. Were college students, we know how to write essays. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course for those who have a passion for medieval history. The professors covered virtually all corners of the globe over the semester, giving a solid background to any student. Definitely the most outstanding weakness of the course is its lack of coherence. Often the readings were exceptionally boring and did not match the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Because it was taught by two professors, the course tended to seem unorganized. Professors Hansen and Winroth weren't always on the same page, so sometime lectures did not flow very well. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course would be the material. The material is interesting, it is not too vague to be boring and not to specific to make students feel disinterested. In addition to the material, it was presented in a great way through our lecturers, Prof Winroth and Hansen. Who provide their own insights, sometime even differing when presenting the subject matter.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses include the lack of involvement between the course faculty and the students, beyond section and lecture I rarely thought about this course, probably leading to the lack of impression this course had on my semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: only a few short papers to write\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were generally all over the place and needed to be more connected ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course of many regions of the world around the year 1000. Although the unifying concept, the idea that globalization started around 1000, was on shaky ground, the course did make a good argument for it. I wish that we had covered a little bit more theories of history that would help us think about these claims. ",
            "\u00a0I think a big weakness of this class is the structure. We had optional short responses due on Wednesday, but I felt as if they were not as beneficial as they could be because we would learn crucial information on Wednesday's in class and in the after class section.  I felt as if this structure did not provide enough time to properly write the short response paper since they were grading it so strictly and rightfully so.  I also felt as if both the teachers gave up and although I felt as if it was warranted I feel like it did not do anything to improve the atmosphere of the classroom. Lastly, I felt that some of the readings should be changed. For example, the Kuhn book was great and it really added to my knowledge on China, but I felt as if the Moore book fell short and its overarching thesis did not coincide with what we learned in class. Furthermore, the Vinland Sagas, although, a fascinating read did not particularly do anything to enhance my insight on the Vikings. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum was very unorganized. We would jump around different world regions with little regard to how they connected or any regard for any sort of timeline. Basically the class lacked any semblance of structure. And the PowerPoints only had pictures on it so you never knew what information you needed to take notes on. I felt like the instructors needed to make a greater effort to demonstrate that the information we were learning was important, that it mattered and had some value outside the classroom. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you actually enjoy (or suspect you have some interest in) learning about the medieval world. Just expect to read many pages of primary texts and historical papers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not - I learned very little and feel as if it was a total waste of my time.  You only get 36 credits at Yale, and you should spend them in course where you might actually learn something, or get meaningful feedback from the professor.  Papers are required to be written in the most juvenile way, methods that I was taught to stop using in middle school are required to gain points for the papers in the class.  You are asked to know obscure terms on the final that have had little to no relevance to the course itself.  Unusually harsh and arbitrary grading in order to have a 'range of grades' in the course.  Poorly designed lectures with massive amounts of text on slides.  Do NOT take this course!! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. Great for anyone interested in medieval history ",
            "\u00a0Take the class if you're looking for an easy-ish pre industrial credit or HU credit. There are definitely much more interesting classes. The global view means you get some cool connections, but for the most part you don't really understand anything in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class, its pure ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. I had to practically learn everything myself at the very end and the course did not prepare me for the assignments that they required. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. Some of the subjects were very uninteresting, and overall, the lecturers (who are individually very intelligent, interesting lecturers) could have made the course more stimulating and relatable to current day issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to someone who loved the year 1000. Otherwise, the course seemed a bit too specific and pigeonholed too much into certain subjects for my taste. ",
            "\u00a0While the course materials are very interesting, the grading of papers can be very arbitrary and unfair at times. The TAs were great, but the lectures were poorly organized. ",
            "\u00a0Not really since the material of this time period of history was minimal. The instructors did their best to make the subject interesting but the lack of any innovations during this time period did make the class dull. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is one of the few courses that teaches history from a global perspective. I think that this is very important because many history majors will find themselves focusing on a very narrow portion of world history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great class to take credit D to balance out a heavy STEM schedule, as I got to listen to great lectures and read the primary sources without having to worry about my grade and making sure I got through all of the reading, which was substantial. I also felt like I learned something every time I wrote a paper- this class didn't assign any busywork, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to specific students. If you  are a potential history major or are passionate about history, this is an interesting course. However, if you are not, then it will be hard to follow and sometimes the information will seem pointless/out of place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would ",
            "\u00a0To me this course was an interesting way to get out of the mindset of a heavy QR workload. If you are looking for a genuine history course where you will invest a lot of time look elsewhere. Otherwise this course serves a good introduction into world history. ",
            "\u00a0No, only take this course if you are really, really interested in people trading stuff with each other during the year 1000. Otherwise, this course is just another course where you need to memorize random foreign names and write meaningless papers. ",
            "\u00a0I love history and I personally believe that world history classes are important to broadening a student's perspective, but the rushed nature of this course did not lend itself to truly teaching anything. It made it seem as if the year 1000 was disconnected and unrelated to current events, which I do not believe is what the professors intended.  For those reasons, I would not recommend this class or its proceeding modules to neither history majors nor stem majors. "
