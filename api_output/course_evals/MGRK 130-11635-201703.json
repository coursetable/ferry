            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that with a smaller class size, we are able to work a lot on speaking and conversations, which is the most important, and often most difficult, part of learning a language. The work load is effective and very manageable. The only weakness I can think of is the way the course book sometimes teaches grammar, and would benefit from a slightly less usage based approach and more of a chart and rule based one. "
