            "\u00a0Not at all. I'm terribly disappointed about this class. We only focused on macroeconomic models and extremely high level carbon footprint analysis that are not translatable to any other country aside from the OECD countries, China and India. We had only two lectures on organizations and buildings' carbon footprint, but we didn't learn how to calculate their carbon footprint nor had any activity on them, which was the main reason I joined the class.

            "\u00a0The main weakness of the class was the poor quality in the delivery of the lectures. Professor Hertwich was not prepared for the classes and rushed through the slides without giving any background information and simply showing a lot of formulas that were incomprehensible and unrealistic to even attempt to explain in 10 seconds per slide, without even including the reference of what each formula/letter meant in the same slide.\r\nIn addition, the lectures on MatLab had the same drawbacks, as the professor would be writing the codes (arriving to the correct formula after several attempts, showing that he didn't prepare for the class) at the same time that he would be explaining super fast what he was trying to do, with many codes being completely new to the class and he not explaining what they meant nor what they were intending to do. Imagine trying to type a code on your computer, understand what the new code means, understand what the professor is intending to do, and rushing to the next code with lacking explanation, all at same time. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the lectures felt a little arbitrary at times; it was hard to suss out conceptual relationships both within and between lectures. A higher level view may have helped to organize the information and communicate the significance of particular subjects that we encountered along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Great way to learn how to use Matlab for analysis. However, there are some big jumps in difficulties between some homework. ",
            "\u00a0I ended up learning a lot, but many of the tutorials were not very well organized and frankly misleading, as the prof would sometimes himself get confused in the middle of showing something. I think it wouldn't take too much work to streamline the lectures--the confusing parts that have to be edited out mid-class are what makes learning the most difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be more focused on practical applications, with more time for students to work with the professor and teaching assistant to learn the skills taught in the class. My questions were rarely answered in office answers and I fumbled around on the homeworks without feeling like I learned anything. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures, project. Weaknesses: lab instruction (learning Matlab), not enough support for HW. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-organized and quite well-structured for learning. 1 lecture and 1 lab session a week was good for learning concepts and theories and subsequently applying those concepts and theories. "

The amount of work it required per week was extremely high for the very lacking lectures, and you will only ever use again the teachings of this class if you work on academia or research about whole-country economies carbon footprint calculations. This class won't help you to calculate carbon footprints of anything smaller than that--smaller products, buildings, organizations. ",
