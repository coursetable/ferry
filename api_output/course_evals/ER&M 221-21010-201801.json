            "\u00a0About the field of critical refugee studies and how to engage with it critically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read complex theoretical texts in a comprehensive and multilayered way. I learned to do repetitive readings in order to focus on different levels of observation, and I learned to synthesize readings into weekly responses. I learned to analyze film and apply the theoretical frameworks we learned to those films. I learned to think more expansively about the field of refugee studies, our geopolitical moment, and about ways to think progressively and constructively without losing a sense of context and history. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt to think more criticallt and broadly about refugees - the definitions used by the UN, mainstream media represenrations and refugee agency ",
            "\u00a0This class provided me with knowledge about current global refugee phenomenon. It also gave me different lenses to understand it and provided me with the background context to understand its history and how it came to be shaped the way it did. ",
            "\u00a0How to think critically about what it means to be a refugee, far beyond common misconceptions. "

            "\u00a0Strength was the weekly student presentations on the readings. They gave great synopses and facilitated productive class discussions on the material. ",
            "\u00a0It was great! ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the weekly reading responses and the way in which the syllabus was constructed. The classroom discussions were really enriching, and I so much appreciated the opportunity to work on a group project with my peers. I only wish we had more frequent feedback on our participation and reading responses. I also so much enjoyed giving a presentation with one of my peers. I felt I learned so much more deeply from the readings that week, especially because we took so much time to talk about them outside of class in order to pull out the strands we felt were most important to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course definitely lay in the students that Professor Tran picks and the carefully selected texts. Everything we read has a clear purpose and it brings together the themes of temporality and resistance. The course could be improved by providing more guest speakers. Definitely some of the best moments and knowledge came from listening to people who are refugees and those who work in the field. ",
            "\u00a0In a seminar-style course, I expected more discussion than there was. The course was well-organized and student presentations offered good opportunity to present material, but I feel that generally, engagement with the course was not very high. Discussions, if facilitated better, could have engaged students better, instead of being able to watch fellow students shop online. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely - this course offers a way to think about refugees that goes beyond normative frameworks of citizenship, and instead the poses ethical, theoretical, and political stakes of refugeeness in a way that demands more of our capabilities to imagine and build better conditions for refugee communities. I appreciated that everyone in the class brought different perspectives with them - we had some students who came from a journalism perspective, others who came from public health perspectives, etc. I think a course like this is really necessary in our current political moment. Quan Tran is a fantastic professor and a really thoughtful, generous section leader. Everyone should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a terribly important subject matter to learn about and to think critically about. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course!! Professor Tran is always so accommodating, sweet, and just a nice personality. You won't have anyone else who teaches the material better. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! Very important, especially now. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact, I already have. It's a really helpful introduction to critical studies, and it's a really important lens for understanding the way imperialism manifests in our present day, and for the way in which borders and the nation-state system are inherently violent and restrictive. It really helped me to think more expansively in all my classes, and to imagine other ways on envisioning a world. ",
            "\u00a0I wiuld definitely recommend intro to critical refugee studies. Professor Tran is amazing - great at facilitating section, incredibly knowledgeable and good at asking follow-up questions. The class looks broadly at questions of critical refugee studies in a way that definitely opened my eyes to a lot of different issues and agents. The reading list was excellent and class was always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course if you get a spot in the class. It really challenged my notions about refugees and helped me better understand how it came to be. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the subject matter, but didn't absolutely love the course-- sad. "
