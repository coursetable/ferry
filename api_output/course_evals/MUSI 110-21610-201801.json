            "\u00a0It covers the basics of music theory well. You cover a lot at a fast pace but it's manageable and would be a bore if it were any slower. \r\nIt could be improved by making the interval training and sight singing part of the final. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job covering the basics of music. I personally found it very helpful, as I knew nothing beforehand. However, one issue was that it was tailored to classical music, which is not very relevant to me (Im an a cappella singer). I also hear there is a large gap between this level and the next level of music theory. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. Treat the course like a new language and you will get a lot out of it. Like learning a new language, music theory is all about exposing yourself to the details of the material through sheer repetition and quantity of practice. The workload may be higher than average, but the difficulty of the work is not overwhelming. It may take a while to complete assignments, but you can always make continual progress throughout each assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who play an instrument at whatever level and want to learn more about the theory of music. It's actually very useful in terms of improving composition strategies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you have absolutely no musical background, this course is quite helpful. Otherwise you should probably be taking a higher level course. If triads are not a new concept to you and you can read notes, you should probably not be in this level, but if those are new to you (as they were for me), its a very helpful course. "
