I feel so strongly about this evaluation that I have never been more angry in my life composing a single piece of writing. I honestly don't even know where to begin. This class was the biggest waste of my time. The professor was not serious  he showed up to class, unprepared, often with some of the notes still in his office. He would present the concepts in the most convoluted, counter-intuitive manner, such that it was impossible to understand what was going on. And the the tests were way too difficult.

We always joked that he acted as if he was drunk giving lectures, and turns out, he was. When I was talking to him up-close asking him a question after class, I could smell that he reeked of alcohol.

Lecture was also pretty unhelpful, you can do all of your learning from the textbook. The exams were quite odd and pretty hard. I didn't like the high-stakes multiple-choice questions (one question could be 10% of your test grade, and since it's MC, there is no chance for partial credit) and there was often one (big, like 12-15% of the test) question that was kind of out of nowhere. I think they are meant to be \"challenge questions\" but it's annoying because they aren't something that we have 100% learned about. I get that he is trying to test our understanding of concepts in a different setting, but I think it's unfair to make that such a substantial portion of the test. Those should be 5 points, or just the extra credit question. ",

There is a lot of potential for this class in terms of materials that could be supplied (Sapling, practice problems, lecture time, discussions) however this particular term fell very short. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like there was often a disconnect between what was emphasized in lecture and what was emphasized on the exam. I felt like the questions on the exams seemed often trivial and difficult to answer, with a focus on memorization of specific details rather than the problem solving and mathematical skills that chemistry requires. I felt disillusioned because I wish I had learned more about how to critically analyze chemistry-related problems such as deriving solutions to X scenario, rather than having to memorize the pros and cons of a lead battery. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course included material that was interesting to learn about and the effectiveness of discussion section worksheets in aiding learning . Weaknesses included the somewhat unorganized fashion of teaching in class/lecture and the occurrences of off-topic material in lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The material of CHEM 165 is fine. The problem was Professor Schmuttenmaer. He was disorganized, did not know the material, did not create fair exams, and regularly gave us incorrect information or was blatantly wrong in his examples. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a decent overview of topics in general chemistry. However professor Schmuttenmaer is rather disorganized and a very poor test writer. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was horrible. I learned nothing each time, so I had zero motivation to come to class. I had to teach myself the material, and it was extremely difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The course was poorly organized, lecture was not informative, and tests were not representative of content we were supposed to have been taught. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to address the strengths of this course because they were few and far between. The discrepancies between 165 and 161 in terms of the organization and structure were in a word shocking. First semester, Professor Hollande did an amazing job by teaching the material in a different way than the textbook, which we had for ourselves. He used clicker questions to make sure we were actively learning and present in lecture, and also mixed in demos almost every class to provide a visual interactive understanding of the material. In 165, this varied pedagogy was entirely absent. The professor very literally projected the textbook onto the screen (occasionally upside down and often hard to see because he didn't zoom in) and regurgitated the practice problems in the book. In my view, the point of lecture should be to provide a different way of looking at the material than the textbook so as to maximize the students' understanding through varied approaches to the concepts. Schmuttenmaer wholly failed in this regard and to make matters worse, often forgot his lecture notes in his office leading to awkward pauses in lecture where he would have to run back to his office. Furthermore, he almost never made slides, so it was difficult to take notes on his writing on the board. In fact, he seemed to spend more time making slides relating to his personal political beliefs than to chemistry. The result of this disorganized setup was the complete demotivation of his students as well as a certain animosity between the professor and the students. I'm not surprised that lecture attendance was far lower this semester than last. \r\n\r\nBeyond the lecture, the exams were horribly structured. They often left little space to show work and seemed to address a very narrow set of the material available. In my opinion they did not adequately allow students to demonstrate their knowledge of the textbook material. I am confident that had Professor Hollande made the exams for this semester the students would have felt more comfortable, done better, and felt more confident in the knowledge gained from the course. I think the chemistry department should look at the exams to understand fully what I am saying. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness would be the tardiness of practice exams posted online along with answer keys which is understandable since it was the professor's first year. \r\nOne strength is that the pace of the class was very easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0This class uses Sapling and follows the textbook closely, which is good. However, I think that a lot of students were not super engaged with the material, and quite a few people would never show up to lecture. This is probably because the teaching was a little haphazard. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- a good overview of the second semester of chemistry\r\nweaknesses- lectures could have been more engaging ",
            "\u00a0strength - you work very hard\r\n\r\nweakness- very little payoff, unfair exams, professor makes a lot of mistakes ",
            "\u00a0It was not very engaging, and was taught in a way that was boring and didn't improve my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course included that it had a relatively low workload. There were many more weaknesses than there were strengths to the course. First, lectures were not engaging at all. Second, the homework was not reflective of the tests in many ways. All homework assignments were generated only through a website called \"Sapling,\" and these homework problems usually required minimal effort and were always basic computation questions. The tests however were based on concepts that weren't well explained in lecture, in the homework, or in the textbook. This course could be improved if the instructor had more structure to his lectures and if he made the problem sets tailored to what he actually thought was important to the course. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been helpful to have a way of getting the lecture material more clearly presented/organized to help facilitate learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly hard to follow as the instructor did not do a well job conveying the message of the course.  This course goes way too fast and crams too much information in the time given. ",
            "\u00a0This course revolves around chemistry that needs to be taught. The concepts are difficult to understand but were not explained in lecture. Going to lecture was just seeing examples from the textbook copied on the board with zero explanation. Using lecture to explain examples not from the book would be nice because that would provide more examples to study. Additionally,  the TFs attempted to make section worksheets that were geared toward the test but often times were very different than what was seen on the exam. Teaching more for the exam would improve this course and more structured lectures would be great as well. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very poorly organized and exams were generally graded too easily, thus messing up the curve. Practice tests were not released until a few days before the tests and the answer keys were not at all thorough, making it hard to figure out how to do the problems without going to peer tutors or TAs who also more often than not did not know what the question was really asking. Lectures were also not particularly helpful, this was mostly a self-taught course. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the only strengths of this course would be section - my TF was great and very good at explaining how to go through practice problems/general concepts. In terms of weaknesses, lecture was pretty bad. Prof. Schmuttenmaer pretty much just used the textbook as a script (and sometimes read from it), and worked through some problems (and sometimes made mistakes with them). Because lectures were basically just the textbook in audio form, just reading the textbook often seemed like a better use of time than going to lecture. I know many students did well on midterms and barely went to lecture. The exams themselves were often unpredictable and had insane point distributions - a true/false question that asked you about a topic mentioned once in passing could be worth as much as a calculation related to one of the main concepts of a chapter. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schmuttenmaer is a great person, and you can palpably sense his love for chemistry. However, the class itself was very disorganized in structure. At times, lectures seemed quite useless. For example, when reviewing one chapter section in the book, the professor merely wrote the title of the chapter section and then went on to the next section, without any explanation. Yet, simply learning from the book is counterproductive as well, as the exams tested not necessarily on the content of the course, but random little side notes mentioned in class. This class left me feeling extremely frustrated and exhausted, especially after the organized structure of CHEM161 last semester. ",

I have never been more confused why material was included (and unfairly included) on the exam. On one exam, ten percent of our grade was determined by our ability to remember the definition of a specific word, a word which had little to do with the actual problems that we were required to solve. On another exam, we were asked the strengths and weaknesses of a specific kind of car battery! It was random trivia, and failed to adequately test the knowledge of the students. Sometimes I wondered if the test questions were pulled from \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" or some other gameshow, since they had so little to do with the reality of the material. \r\n\r\nThis class was a generic lecture. It had no strengths. But weaknesses? The lack of correlation between the studied material and the subject matter is a large problem. Furthermore, the horridly written exams pose a threat to any student's grade and sanity alike. To fix this would involve paying attention to the material and writing tests that accurately assess general knowledge, not that one obscure reference the textbook makes on page 693. Honestly it seemed like exams were written by randomly flipping through the textbook and writing down a problem based on whatever page ended up open. What a ridiculous class. ",

Improved organization and coordination would make Chem 165 more useful to students. ",

I learned the vast majority of the content of this class from reading the textbook and watching youtube videos. Chem165 was definitely harder for me than Chem161, but it was probably a combination of having an inexperienced teacher and harder content.

Not only would the student then be able to avoid this travesty of a class, but also Dr. G's hellish lab. This Chemistry sequence was ridiculous. It was so poorly organized and so poorly executed that I have to wonder if it was intended to be a joke. I cannot believe that I gave Yale money to offer this sad excuse for a Chemistry lecture. I might as well have taken \"Do You Have the Chops to Be a Mad Scientist\" Buzzfeed quiz, and it probably would have closely resembled the content of our exams. The material was straightforward enough: titrations, acids and bases, organic compounds... But the exams barely covered this material, and instead asked obscure and outright trivial questions. I put in a lot of work to this class in both textbook readings and problem sets. I almost feel betrayed by the insipid nature of the exams, which failed to adequately assess my knowledge of the subject matter. If you are a STEM kid and have time to memorize every detail of the lectures and readings, go for it and take this class. But if you are a curious kid involved in multiple majors or fields of study, stay away. This is a \"weeder\" class intended to kick people like you in the shins. If you can't memorize the silliest, smallest, and most insignificant of details about the once-mentioned example during class, you might as well just take your B or C now. Stay away from this ridiculous, lazily constructed class. ",

Chem 165 isn't poorly taught, but it's not especially engaging either. ",
