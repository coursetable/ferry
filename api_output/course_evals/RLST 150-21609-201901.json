            "\u00a0I learned about most of the texts in the New Testament, including the context in which they were written, and the different ways in which they could be interpreted. This course also reviewed the origins of various theological positions and contemporary uses of the text. I gained an interest in the New Testament far stronger than what I had going in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically read the Bible and factor in how different reading communities approach, interpret, and use these texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about reading the Bible as a historical source. ",
            "\u00a0Early Christian communities and its tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read the Bible academically and critically through the use of sources that help provide context for and additional information about passages. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of knowledge about the New Testament and the historical context in which it was written as well as the cultural impacts it has had on different reading groups throughout history. I also acquired a newfound skill to analyze biblical and early century texts as well. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: High engagement, Zachary Smith, the reading selections, freedom of topic choice for papers and presentation, manageable amount of readings, in-class discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit fast at times, also as some students  seemed to assume (at least at first) that everyone held their religious beliefs. Also if the course is to continue to stylize itself as the New Testament in History and Culture, perhaps it would benefit from discussing a braoder range of reading communities--Latin America, for example, was discussed only once, despite the fact that the bible has been used to reshape the region's historical path. this being said, I realize the course already does its best to cover a wide-variety of topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course allowed us to effectively discuss with each other what we thought about the sources (primary and secondary) we were reading, both in-class and online. More lecture time may be helpful to get a more solid factual background for the texts, as sometimes we would not get to it since discussion took a long time. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. The subject matter was interesting. I really enjoyed our class trips to the art gallery and library to see documents and artifacts in person. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course I don't think it really can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0A strength this course had was its ability to effectively act as a seminar class style and it was inviting for anyone to participate. A weakness was the on the fly changes we had which made it difficult at times to know what to come to class prepared with. "

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about the world and our past. ",
            "\u00a0yes, particularly if taught by Zach. The material was interesting and relevant. Zach was passionate about the material and helpful. Course contextualizes a lot of what one hear's in today's discussions about Christianity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course allowed us to examine texts critically and dispel a lot of misconceptions about the New Testament and early Christianity as well as learn more broadly how to interact with each other in an appropriate and considerate manner. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in the history of Christianity and the Bible. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Regardless of your personal beliefs, I think it's important to read the New Testament and understand how passages have been interpreted and used in the past and why. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student if they are interested in religious studies or wanted to learn more about the New Testament. Also it is a good class to see experience a functional seminar setting. "
