            "\u00a0Good course that gives students a broad overview into neuroscience and how it ties into economics. I appreciated the fact that the class was taught from a scientific (rather than economics) perspective, and I particularly appreciated the fact that the class went in-depth concerning the pitfalls of many neuroeconomic studies. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about reading and deciphering neurological papers, and learned some game theory and social learning along the way.  Plenty of helpful tidbits on experimental design and on current knowledge on different parts of the brain. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fMRI and its use in Neuroscience studies. ",

            "\u00a0Reading/writing/interpreting/designing neuroeconomics reseach studies. Technical STEM skills. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to read and understand neuroeconomics research, including basic fMRI and other neuroscience techniques and basics of data analysis ",
            "\u00a0This course was both an excellent overview of neuroeconomics as a field and an informative deep dive into fMRI and other brain-imaging techniques as they apply to experiments. I learned how to design an imaging and stimulation experiment from scratch and write a detailed proposal for it, along with being able to read a modern fMRI paper and understand almost every detail. ",
            "\u00a0How neuroscience can be incorporated into other types of research, and how these two seemingly unrelated fields can merge to provide fascinating results. "

            "\u00a0It was a very interesting course, sometimes it was a bit repetitive, especially when reviewing the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Good course with fair workload. Studies covered were interesting, and background presentations of the right difficulty for a non-scientist. Although not a necessity to pass the class, reading the textbook chapters before class really improved my appreciation of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include an intriguing and engaging subject matter and plenty of background knowledge on the brain structures.  Weaknesses include: a lack of communication regarding required econometric prowess / expectations regarding the final project design makeup, unclear expectations with regard to neurological background knowledge, confusingly worded problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of helping students learn about fMRI. However, I think it has a number of weaknesses. First, the connection to economics was vague. Listed as an upper level economics seminar it felt a lot more like an introductory cog sci course as it did not build on any previous economics classes. Additionally, it did very little to develop skills that are applicable outside of fMRI studies. I received very little feedback on my work and I don't feel like I can use any of what I learned in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness i can find is that there were some topics that were very technical for economists to understand, but as a strenght, they were vert well taught ",
            "\u00a0Great, caring professor & TA! Interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learning about recent and exciting new research in the field. \r\nWeaknesses: the same weekly format of the course got a little repetitive and discussion of the papers never really got too in-depth it seemed ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was excellently planned. Perhaps in the future there could be a bit more theoretical explanation before the paper readings and problem sets begin, as the earlier readings were often hard to grasp, given our minimal background. The main project - the final paper and presentation - was incredibly well-designed, and the way it was spread over the semester with lots of feedback made it one of the pleasant and interesting semester-long projects I've ever done. ",
            "\u00a0There was a drastic improvement in the second half of the class, as we broke off into groups more and discussed which helped solidify my thoughts. I thought it could be more improved by fostering a sense of curiosity and engagement, because it seemed that many students were not as engaged. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it is very interesting and not that hard. ",
            "\u00a0Good course that gives students a broad overview into neuroscience and how it ties into economics. I appreciated the fact that the class was taught from a scientific (rather than economics) perspective, and I particularly appreciated the fact that the class went in-depth concerning the pitfalls of many neuroeconomic studies.\r\n\r\nWorkload is fair, and content interesting. Reading the textbook chapters before class is not required by any means, but really helps solidify your understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Sure would! Really cool stuff going on:  my interest was almost always piqued. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this to anyone who does not have a deep desire to lean about fMRI. The workload was low, but I often wasn't sure what I was learning in this course and received very little feedback on my work. It was frustrating and I don't feel like it was worth the time put in. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, it is very complete and interesting ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend for econ majors with some interest in more \"sciency\" stuff and particularly how the brain functions. very much a neuroscience course as well as an econ one ",
            "\u00a0In reality, this course is more about fMRI than about fusing economics and neuroscience. Thus, if you're interested in doing a deep dive into this topic and finally figuring out what all those multicolored brain images in the media and literature actually mean, this is the class for you. While both neuroscience and economics are essential to this course, it does not spend much time on either; this is a tutorial in the experimental design and methods used in a very specific field. Overall, a relaxed and intellectually-stimulating course that you will feel proud to finish. ",
            "\u00a0loved the professor - Ifat is so nice and really wants to help you learn. was structured more like a lecture even though class size was more like a seminar. very neuroscience-y which made the material more dense and harder to process but overall learned a lot and really enjoyed taking the class with Ifat ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class, can be a lecture at times but great to participate if you can. "
