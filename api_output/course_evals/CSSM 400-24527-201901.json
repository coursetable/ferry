            "\u00a0How cities operate, urban design theories, most pressing challenges in urban spaces today, advanced technologies and their applications to cities, and applying academic frameworks to cities around the world ",
            "\u00a0Variety of topics about cities - how they have developed and changed, as well as future possibilities ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the theory and practice of urban design. Gained a more educated and insightful framework for thinking about the different aspects of urbanization and urban needs, especially related to conceptualizing the future of cities. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge/insights - Manasvi and Mat chose really fantastic readings that delved into the history, social tensions, complex forces, and technologies that shape our cities. The class taught us to understand how these forces come together and will impact the future of our shared spaces. It was really cool to hear the experiences of my classmates from the cities they lived in, from LA to overseas countries, and this was maybe one of the most enriching things about the course. I think hearing Mat, Manasvi, and my classmates' lived experiences in the cities was the most memorable thing in the class because it really drove the concepts home, and helped some of the more old/outdated readings we do, come to life. \r\n\r\nThe trip to NYC was very enriching, and it was great to visit Intersection and see the city technologies they create. I really enjoyed hearing Mat and Manasvi's experiences in urban design and corporate technologies. I think the played off each other really well as instructors! ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: workload/assignment structure worked well and was never burdensome. The professors are really thoughtful and fun. They know so much and have unique perspectives as practitioners in the field.\r\nWeaknesses: the three paper assignment prompts were very unclear. As the two professors are practitioners, the class discussion was much more applied and less intellectually stimulating.\r\nAs is the challenge with two co-professors, they sometimes had differing visions for the class, which thus made paper assignments a bit more difficult. I would recommend increasing coordination between the two professors in future classes. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and class discussions! I think the only weaknesses come with it being a new class and taking a couple weeks to get used to the seminar environment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly interesting topic and good discussion. Wonderful professors and LOVED the New York trip. \r\n\r\nWeakness: As it was the first year, I think some of the readings weren't quite as strong, but overall great!\r\n\r\nImprovement: While I understand that they wanted it to be more student-driven, I actually think the professors could have spoken a little more during discussion (about their own work and backgrounds) as they both do such interesting things! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Mat and Manasvi are obviously very bright, interesting, and fantastic class moderators! They brought a ton of passion to the table and helped us have fun discussions. They were always very available for conversation and very open-minded, pushing us to think about ideas in new ways. The fieldtrip was a ton of fun. I learned a lot! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lots of my peers said they didn't read any of the readings except for the modern journalism ones. This was a bit annoying to me, because I read and annotated every reading. But I'd get to class and the class would end up discussion just the modern ones (or maybe 1-2 of the other ones): by chance, or because nobody had read the things. Honestly, this was a bit of a shame because the readings were really interesting and enriching. Perhaps if they were more embedded in practice rather than theory, people would have read more. Or, if they were required to write weekly responses. \r\n\r\nSuggestion - maybe only assign 1-2 required readings, and then assign either *fewer pages* from the other readings (not the whole article/chapter), or split them up. For example, in some of the History courses here at Yale, the professor will have 1-2 required readings a week, then split the other 4-6 readings up between the class students, and each student will talk 5 min about their takeaways from their individual readings, sothat everyone still gets to learn about it. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses I thought the paper prompts were confusing and a little vague. I think the instructors wanted our responses to be far more specific and narrow than the prompts let on. Additionally, the prompts were somewhat uncreative compared to the content of our readings and discussions. The paper prompts were by far the weakest part of the course to me, but it was just the first time the class was being taught! I think this stands out because everthing else about the course was so great . \r\n\r\nThe final prompt (\"imagine you are the mayor of some city, what would you do?\") was cool, but the requested length was.. rather long for a seminar. Most of my other final papers are about 3000 words, this was 4500, and I felt like more guidance about essay subheadings or things to cover would have been helpful. Generally, anything to make the prompts more open-ended in subject (let you choose your own city) but more narrow in focus/theme (what aspect should we write about?) would have been great. ",

            "\u00a0Yes  for a laid back class with two fun professors. I definitely learned about urban design theory, but most students took it as a fifth class. As a fifth class, it is perfect. You still have to work and produce good papers to do well, but you can also put it on the back burner for a few weeks at a time. For students interested in the nitty gritty of urban design, perhaps another course would be a better fit. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! The class was fantastic and it was one of the best first classes that someone outside this field should take to understand our cities. You'll learn about the unexpected forces and ideas that drive our cities. \r\n\r\nIt's a great survey of historical urban concepts, civic art and design, and the modules of the class area really well structured. Be prepared for a *lot* of readings though, which not all of your peers might do. Definitely talk to Mat and Manasvi a lot because they're so knowledgeable. ",
