            "\u00a0I gained very specific insight into the lives and professional evolutions of rebel lawyers from a diverse set of locales. My historical writing skills definitely strengthened in this class, as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about historical analysis and the history of lawyers around the world. I also developed a greater understanding of legal systems around the world and how they differed from the United States legal system. ",
            "\u00a0The title of this course can be a bit deceptive. While you do learn about some very influential lawyers who led revolutions, the main focus is the class is learning about the role of the judicial system in revolutions that happened all over the world. ",
            "\u00a0Reading long texts, reading analysis, and class discussions ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach historical texts and dissect the arguments related to the context of the situation. Also how to analyze the piece and construct my own arguments through comparing and contrasting read pieces and historical contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills on how to write a paper and use evidence to support my ideas as well as analyzing a variety of readings and documents. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a global legal tradition and how this relates to advocacy around the world. I learned to be concise and use a myriad of sources to express a complex viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about lawyers from around the world during the 20th century who were subversive in their countries to produce political change. It was definitely more of a history than legal theory class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a lot of material quickly and glean a general understanding from specific and dense readings. I also learned how to build confidence in a seminar with a group of very smart, eloquent students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the difference between legal systems and political systems and how both can affect the avenues by which lawyers can change things. I also learned what it means to be a lawyer and the different roles, responsibilities, and stereotypes lawyers take on in different cultures and countries. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis on how individual's live's shape their actions ",
            "\u00a0Compiling information from primary resources\r\nConnecting important themes across different historical contexts\r\nInformation on techniques utilized to initiate change in law throughout history ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an excellent in-depth overview of jurists across the world who fight for activist causes. It provides great exposure to the tools of historical analysis, and many of the readings are very interesting. It is one of the few course that goes into almost all regions across the world which gives some exposure to their cultural and legal norms. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of the material, I learned a lot of history that never came up in high school and was refreshing because it was not only about the US and Europe. I developed new insights into the law and how it functions with politics and revolutionary movements. I definitely learned a lot about the involvement of lawyers in history that had never even crossed my mind before. More practically I learned to get through and absorb challenging legal documents and primary sources. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was interesting and we did cover all of the themes in the syllabus, but I felt like the course description was, at least in part, false advertising. The syllabus said we would be covering lawyers and events from around the world, but most of these, even those outside of the Indian subcontinent, had some major link back to India. For the next time this class is run, I think it would be worth it to expand the scope of the class to other areas of the world that weren't covered, as I am sure they have equally as interesting and relevant legal topics to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and transcends a stereotypical, Western-centric view of lawyer rebels. It requires, however, a copious quantity of reading and wholly ignores the region of Latin America, instead disproportionately focusing on South Asia, which is Professor De's region of specialty. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Did a good job of covering a lot of the globe except for South America, the discussion in class was always engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was simply too much reading to process efficiently and be prepared to discuss, at times this affected the quality of discussion during class, also the film assignments were very open ended and unclear on their expectations ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness was that the quantity of reading was often too large, so it was not uncommon for at least half of the class to not have completed the reading for that day. However, for the days that one had done all the reading, the conversation was very thought provoking and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Readings are often too long and there are numerous assignments. Most readings are interesting and facilitate good class discussions ",
            "\u00a0I loved every single thing about this course other than the professors slow grading. No one knew where they stood in the class and some assignments were optional depending on grades on other assignments, so that didn't really work out. Also the deadlines were pushed back several times for several assignments, and this was helpful for many people until a certain point where it created more chaos than support. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: quite a bit of discussion and engagement\r\nWeaknesses: quite a bit of readings ",
            "\u00a0This course condenses a lot of information into a semester, but the discussions we had comparing different legal systems and strategies that lawyers used were amazing, but sometimes the class contained too much material that we could not cover. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course but it was really hard to follow at times because I didnt have the hirtorical background knowledge to follow our discussions. Maybe. A small one sentnece summary of the time period and events around the readings could be given before each day on the syllabus so I could at least know what to google. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there were two major weaknesses in this course. First, the readings assigned were just too extensive. I would spend hours reading things we never ended up discussing in class or writing about, which felt a bit like a waste of time. The other issue was the fact that the professor assigned many papers but didnt grade them so we never knew how to improve our writing. Overall, however, the professor was brilliant and the course was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0It was very interesting and thought-provoking. The films we had to watch were very intriguing and many of the people we studied taught us a lot about how lawyers can make changes within the legal system that they are working in. Sometimes the reading was a little hard to manage because it was long and dense - very academic texts. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very interesting but sometimes suffered from too much homework the readings could get to be difficult to manage at times. Otherwise the course worked quite well. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: interesting topics\r\nWEAKNESS: workload often too much ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nManageable workload\r\nEngaging material\r\nDiversity of the topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHeavy reading ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that the class time is effectively and engagingly used as the already incredibly interesting readings are extrapolated on in well-directed discussions. The class is also supplemented well with such materials as films and youtube videos, role-playing exercises, and a class on archival research. It provides interesting and new insights that I hadn't been exposed to into many well known historical figures and events. The weaknesses are that at times the readings could be overwhelming in amount and that assignments weren't graded until a very long time after they were assigned significantly decreasing the value and availability of feedback. In the future, I would suggest tightening the course by lowering the number of readings and assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself is excellent. I think it could benefit from more organization of the syllabus (there were several last minute changes in readings and due dates.) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was good, but it was also a lot of work and had unreasonable deadlines more times than excusable (draft for final essay due on Sunday of Thanksgiving break, three essays (including the final project) due during reading/final exam period), and it was not as organized as I would've liked. It's not what I expected but I don't regret taking the course per se. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but I would caution them that it requires a lot of work and a lot of writing. A student's area of interest must be pretty specifically focused for them to get the most out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are prepared to do a lot of reading on a daily basis and are interested in law around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. Professor De really encourages students to back their claims, so often when someone would say something he had follow up questions that really pushed us to think about what we were saying. Additionally, other than the quantity of reading, the work isn't to bad. The written work is very easy to do as long as you pay attention to the discussions in class and are familiar with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it is a lot of work and reading ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great survey history course relating to the law and the professor is top knotch. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like history and analysis, I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was an incredible course. I learned about things I never would have known otherwise, things that are so relevant to the modern world. If you have a chance, I urge you to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend to anyone interested in history or law and gaining a more nuanced perspective of what law and rebellion meant in the 20th century ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student if they are comfortable sharing their ideas and discussing their opinions with other students in a seminar setting, and are also willing to spend a considerable amount of time reading for the class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but I would warn them about the workload. ",
            "\u00a0YES. But student must understand it is a great time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the topic of the seminar was very engaging. Not only was I interested all semester, but I became a better student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course texts are mostly engaging and have a very large degree of variety making sure that if one week the readings didn't appeal to your interests, the next they likely will. The class itself is very engaging, and Professor De's discussion comments in class were always incisive. Overall, the class was fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course has very interesting material and really lets you discuss a lot of history that don't come up in many other courses and is very relevant to many current legal issues. "
