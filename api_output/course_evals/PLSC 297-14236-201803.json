            "\u00a0I learned so much about revolutions, civil disobedience, and political violence. More than that, I learned about studying history in general. He emphasizes the importance of historical context which makes the philosophy feel much more applied. Thinking carefully about revolutionary change in history is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Reflected on the relationship between morality and politics (how to unify them in society if they can be at all, the use of violence to achieve moral or political ends, etc) ",
            "\u00a0I learned about prominent political philosophers and the intersection of morality and politics from a theoretical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Robust training in analyzing theoretical texts and comparing them to practical case studies as a final paper topic. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about philosophy and how classic conceptions of morality can be applied (or not) to politics. ",
            "\u00a0This is a political philosophy course that requires close analysis of dense literature. I improved my close reading skills and knowledge of political theorists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss theoretical questions of the interplay between morality and politics in the context of personal/lived histories of the authors. I developed a much better understanding of each of the people and texts that we analyzed. ",
            "\u00a0Great critical thinking skills, awesome insight into some of the best thinkers of all time, and really inspiring lectures that make you feel you're ready to conquer the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the debate surrounding the use of violence in politics and how to understand political theory arguments on a deeper level. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me better understand arguments for civil disobedience and whether morality can sometimes conflict with the law. Relative to Kapustin's other courses, this one was especially helpful in teaching students to critically analyze works by actual actors -- instead of theorists -- in politics. ",
            "\u00a0I again learned about political theory and its applications. I found this class to be extremely helpful in reading political theory and having really intellectual well structured conversations in class. ",
            "\u00a0I engaged with, and attained a working knowledge, of  fascinating thinkers like Fanon, Guevara, Thoreau, Gandhi, Niebuhr, Mannheim, Rawls, and more. The course both sharpened my philosophical-abstract thinking and equipped me with the intellectual tools to explicate and critique moral theories of violence, nonviolence, and emancipation. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to read and better interpret philosophical and theoretical texts\r\nI became more familiar with the theories and practices of different thinkers, whose work I had not encounter before\r\nI hope that I learnt how to discuss those ideas with my class mates in a more engaging way ",
            "\u00a0A thoughtful evaluation of political theories on morality espoused by thinkers involved in real, morally complex situations -- not just armchair philosophers. Focus on the questions of when and if violence is morally permissible in politics, and the relationship between politics and morality more generally. "

            "\u00a0Boris is an incredible professor. He is endlessly passionate and seems to have an encyclopedia of texts and their interrelations at his finger tips. His seminars follow a very logical structure (unlike many where the Prof. spends a lot of time talking). ",
            "\u00a0Boris is brilliant and very intense. He tends to monopolize the \"seminar\" which is honestly better because the texts are rather complex and he understands them better than any student could. Including a lecture component to the course would not be ill-advised, as it could actually enhance our understanding of the texts to start with a thorough backgrounder before actually reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not a typical seminar. The professor would often lecture during class, but I learned a lot from class. There was less student discussion than one would anticipate. Classes were well-organized, with clear discussion points and questions. The readings were a fair length and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Excellent reading list\r\n- Engaging class discussions\r\n- Training in reading and analyzing complex texts \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Readings can be dense sometimes with limited class time to dicuss and delve deep in them. \r\n- Not a lot of opportunities for grading and improvement: only a mid-term and a final paper ",
            "\u00a0Class was amazing. Professor Kapustin was an absolute asset to the class and facilitated great discussions. Can't think of many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading was assigned each week but we did not cover much of the reading given the time constraints. I think it could be more effective to assign less in order to allow us to focus on whatever will be discussed in seminar. The biggest strength of the course is Professor Kapustin  he is extremely knowledgeable and provides helpful feedback on writing. Weakness of the course is the 60% weight on the final paper  I think it could be more evenly distributed. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are all very good, but I'd like to see more gender diversity on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Boris is legendary and one of the most emphatic lecturers at Yale. He's so excited about the material that you can't help but be excited too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Boris is so excited that he might go on a 25-minute rant and take up valuable \"seminar\" time for people to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the philosophical literature that it covers and Professor Kapustin himself. All of the philosophical readings were very interesting and elucidated the earlier readings in the course. Professor Kapustin is absolutely phenomenal - he is so passionate and intelligent, yet still accessible. The only strength of this course is that some of the earlier readings are not necessarily that philosophical in the traditional sense (which is kind of the point of them), but I am personally more interested in the actual philosophical underpinnings of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the fascinating reading list, unparalleled teaching, and covering of consistent themes (civil disobedience, morality and politics, arguments for revolution, concept of utopia) that allowed us to leave the class with concrete takeaways. The only weakness is that some of the questions introduced at the beginning of the term were explored but ultimately left unsettled by the end. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus got the class is amazing! Unfortunately we fell behind so we didnt get to talk through it all. I wouldve loved to have had the chance to work through Arendt and Honnderich with Prof. Kapustin. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are certainly Professor Kapustin and the class size. I think maybe even a few less students would do the course justice. The readings are just the right length and the conversations in class are really well structured and led by Kapustin. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much everything has been calibrated to near-perfection: insightful and focused lectures, fascinating readings, and consistent themes which grow more vivid and nuanced with each passing week. Professor Kapustin might be the best lecturer I've had in my time here. If there are any weaknesses, it's that the classroom is a little too small. Also, we ended up falling behind and so had to sacrifice one of our thinkers (Arendt) which is a shame because I love Arendt and was really looking forward to Kapustin's typically brilliant take on her. On the other hand, I got so much out of the thinkers we did engage, both the familiar (Gandhi, Plato, Niebuhr) and the unfamiliar (Mannheim, Havel, Fanon) that that's but a very, very minor criticism. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of this course was great. I really enjoyed getting to look at how practice and theory inform one another, and I could think of no better way to do this, than through analyzing individual people throughout history. At times, I did feel like I was lacking background knowledge about the contexts in which these thinkers were working: Gandhi (South Africa and India), Robespiere (The French Revolution), for example. I think I would have been able to understand these thinkers processes, if I knew more about these contexts. Saying that, I see that more as a personal lack of knowledge, and not something the course should have provided. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, and I feel like I got a lot out of it. If I was to mention one way in which I think it could be improved, I would say that class discussions could have been more engaging. I often felt like everyone in the class was talking to Professor Kapustin instead of discussing these ideas with one another. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are really fascinating, and by a diverse array of influential thinkers (though we read only men). Professor Kapustin's style of teaching  posing a question to the class and then synthesizing student answers to make clear, nuanced, and thoughtful points was really effective. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are willing to engage with the readings! ",
            "\u00a0I would. EPE changed requirements (again smh) so this no longer counts as an advanced seminar (which is whack) but it's still super interesting and not going to introduce too much stress to your life. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in political philosophy. This is a wonderful seminar to learn about the groundwork of moral political philosophy. However, this class is very theoretical with little application to current and historical events. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I do. If you are looking to learn how to analyze complex theoretical texts and for an opportunity to analyze them in the context of a case study. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. I hadn't done much philosophy beforehand but I quickly fell in love with it. Professor Kapustin is amazing and the topics and readings we covered were really interesting and engaging. The workload is not that high, just about 80 pages of reading a week and then discussions of what we'd read in seminar (you kind of have to close read though because the discussion is quite in depth). ",
            "\u00a0Yes  if you have an interest in political theory, this is a must-take course. The final paper allows you to explore an area in the course that you find interesting and demonstrate your knowledge of the texts. Professor Kapustin is a great professor to learn from. If you have the opportunity to take his courses, you should. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - I think it is a rare opportunity to get to discuss important questions of political theory in the context of personal histories (and at Yale more broadly). ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to explore political philosophy with one of the best lecturers at Yale. Do be advised that there is some presumed knowledge of fundamental political philosophers, so it's best to have taken a few philosophy courses before taking this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. For one, Professor Kapustin is one of the best professors I have had the privilege of having during my time at Yale. He is so passionate, intelligent, and knowledgeable - I am constantly in awe of him after every single class. He has the ability to elucidate even the densest of texts too. The material was overall really interesting, particularly the material at the end of the course. I think this course strikes a good balance between being appealing to both students that are interested in philosophy and political theory and those that are more unfamiliar with this type of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if the student wants to dive deeply into philosophical ideas such as the use of violence in a political context and understand how to reconstruct the arguments of thinkers like Thoreau on a issue by issue basis, this is the course for them. ",
            "\u00a0If you are reading this evaluation trying to decide between this and another course, please DON'T hesitate to take this course. Spending time with Kapustin and learning from his profound, encyclopedic mind is the best thing you can do as a Yale student. Classes like this are why you came to college.\r\n\r\nWould absolutely recommend this course to all Yale students, especially those interested in both political theory or working in politics at a practical level. Every student at Yale should take a course with Kapustin if they are able, as he is the best instructor I have had in my time here. In a school full of great minds, Kapustin stands out as one of its most brilliant thinkers. This course might be appealing to a wider range of students because it spends the bulk of the syllabus on practical politics instead of theory, which is more accessible to students with less interest in philosophy. Students interested in how to deal with immoral laws and promote a better society would love this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Kapustin is an incredible teacher. He truly cares about his students and meaningfully engages in our discussion. He is excellent at facilitating discussion, allowing for student engagement without losing the focus of conversation ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but for a certain kind of student. Its certainly a more intellectual course than the average political science class and require reading some relatively difficult texts. But if you do the readings and participate in the class discussion, you will be rewarded. ",
            "\u00a0A must-take for anyone passionate about political philosophy. Professor Kapustin is just incredible, as kind as he is . He's one of the best, if not the best, lecturers I've had in my four years at Yale, the type who gets you as excited about the material as he himself is. There are moments in the semester where the sheer brilliance of his insights just induces an adrenaline rush. He manages to render legible and almost simple the most incomprehensible of texts. Even more impressive is the meticulous construction and thematic cohesiveness of the course as a whole--Kapustin has selected and organized the readings in a manner that allows them to engage and critique one another, often in ways you don't realize until you're reviewing your notes. The result is an epic conversation happening across literally centuries of time and thousands of miles on the subjects of violence, nonviolence, morality, all distilled into dense but digestible weekly two-hour sessions that are reliably intellectually stimulating. Every once in a while you'll come across a thinker/reading that isn't as engaging as the others, but even the less interesting material is of some immense value in Kapustin's assured hands. He's that good. Again, must-take. When it comes to political philosophy, there's very little, if anything, at Yale that beats this. If nothing, take it for Kapustin, who is as kind as he is brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. We read great thinkers in this class, the workload was manageable, and the material relevant to anyone who is interested in how people have made important choices in the past and present. "
