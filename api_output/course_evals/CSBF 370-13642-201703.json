            "\u00a0I truly learned how to make a piece for radio! I learned how to write for radio, what makes a good radio piece, and gained new skills for finding stories. ",
            "\u00a0How to produce podcasts ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the recording equipment, how to have an interview, how to write for radio in my voice, how to structure and edit a story, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic in learning how radio stories are made. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. I had never taken any journalism-related classes before this one and I was intimidated by my classmates, who had experience writing for different publications at Yale. I quickly found that radio journalism comes with its own unique challenges and possibilities and was excited to find out that we all had a lot to learn. I enjoyed all of the exercises that taught me what good radio is and how to create strong pieces myself. I am proud of what I accomplished in the course and it was definitely one of the best, if not the best, courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write for radio, something I did not realize would be so difficult. This class teaches you important skills about writing and reporting that arent available  in many Yale classes. ",
            "\u00a0Good development of reporting, interviewing, editing, mixing skills. Definitely changed the way I talk to people and the way I ask questions and made me prepare for the interviews much more than I have in the past in order to get what I wanted out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned all the basic how-tos about radio reporting, audio editing and on-air interviewing. "

            "\u00a0This class is AWESOME! Chris is really a great professor and you engage really closely with the material. The assignments are fun and a good change of pace. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great for learning the basics of making pieces in this medium and becoming engaged in the Yale community. I learned so much more about other students by interviewing them for different assignments. I liked the workshop format. I think the feedback from Chris could be more timely, because it was hard to receive on Sunday/Monday to turn in a new story for Monday night. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course ",
            "\u00a0We started writing stories the first day we came to class. We learned how to write pitches, record and conduct interviews, and edit pieces by actually doing it. Our results weren't always perfect, but they helped us to learn quickly. By listening to and workshoping both pieces that had been aired and pieced by our classmates, we were able to learn what made certain stories successful. I can't think of a better way to learn, especially when learning how to produce stories for the radio. I was able to watch myself and my fellow classmates grow throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I felt was how late the class met. In a 7-9 class it is difficult to be as alert as you are in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I think students would really benefit from doing some assigned listening outside of class. We always try to listen to a few clips at the beginning of class, but there is never enough time to listen to very much and also workshop everyone's projects. Since our reading load wasn't very heavy, the \"listening load\" could probably be increased, just so students are exposed to a little more. ",
            "\u00a0I don't really see any weaknesses of this course except perhaps the lack of accountability for turning things in on time. The Group A Group B workshopping got thrown off when people turned in stuff late, which could have possibly been avoided with some more deliberate planning further up the road. "

        [
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY! It's a great class, it meets once a week at night, and the level of engagement is really high. You get constant feedback on your work, which is really helpful, and create a tangible product by the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone interested in radio even a little, because it is a great way to spend your time. ",
            "\u00a0yes. it is a great course to learn about the radio journalism world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone interested. I learned so much and had a great time doing it. I wasn't sure that I would be able to keep up without any journalism experience, but I was happy to find out that everyone in our class ended up producing interesting and unique pieces. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you enjoy reporting this class is definitely for you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Super fun course that forces you to get out of the library to go do your assignments and works in a medium that we aren't typically that exposed to at Yale. It's not a ton of work, but if you put off the mixing, be prepared to be working down to the wire in order to get the assignment in on time, as that part always takes longer than you think it's going to. Chris is so cool and supportive and this will be a class you'll look forward to going to every week. Even if you don't get in one year, try again in the future because Chris takes that into account when he lets people in to the class. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite course I've taken at Yale. "
