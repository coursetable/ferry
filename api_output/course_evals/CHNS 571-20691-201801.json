            "\u00a0I expanded my knowledge of the usage of literary Chinese, common and less common grammar structures or character uses, and different genres of literary writing. ",
            "\u00a0Learned Classical Chinese and how to approach a variety of texts written in it. Also learned bibliographical and research skills - how to access and use dictionaries, commentaries, and digital resources to answer questions about material. ",
            "\u00a0I further developed my ability to read documents written in classical Chinese. Moreover, I have discovered the resources available at my disposal to continue with self-guided independent research on or using classical Chinese sources. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my awareness of the canon of literary Chinese texts, which was very limited (no high school or college level formal coursework devoted to Chinese literature, history or thought!!!) That was an additional HUGE benefit for me in taking this course besides the more general benefit of growing more comfortable with reading texts and looking up definitions, translations, and biographical/geographical knowledge in reference works.

            "\u00a0The readings from many different authors and in different genres was really useful for seeing all the different ways in which literary Chinese can be used. The individual translation projects were also great for those of us with interests in poetry, history, theater, literature, religious texts, and so forth.\r\n\r\nWe often spent too much time at the beginning of class going over only tangentially related materials, so we often did not finish reviewing a translated text until the following class session or week. Some of the translations we had to rush through at the end of class in order to keep up with the course schedule, so the first half of many translations are clearer than the second half.\r\n\r\nI would put less weight on the final examination and have a larger final project instead, as the final project is more akin to the sort of work some of the students will be doing with literary Chinese in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I think it gives a very good grounding in Classical Chinese and how to carefully read texts. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that provides us with the skills needed to continue our study of classical Chinese independently. Given this emphasis, then, I think I would prefer to see the final translation project weighed more heavily against the final. ",
            "\u00a0Although this improved after I consulted Professor Lin, I think the general structure of the course could benefit from an establishment from the beginning about the openness of the course to scholars who may be focusing on Japan (or Korea or Vietnam) who need to develop language skill and general canon awareness but who are not learning Mandarin. Students (maybe just one or two) would often make jokes in Mandarin that were completely alienating to me, not knowing the language well enough to understand. There seemed to be an expectation that I should have learned Mandarin already but somehow I got by without it, but this should not be the prevailing sentiment. Even by the end of the course, I did not feel that the China scholars in the room were aware of the influence of Chinese language throughout Asia, such that scholars of Japan and Korea might want to learn to read pre-modern texts but not be able to devote much time to learning the modern language. I have met China scholars who need to learn Japanese for research: I understand that they do not necessarily have the interest or bandwidth to learn Japanese as a social language, therefore I would try not to impose that on them in the classroom setting. I wish I could have had this conversation with the classmates I had issues with but since it became more of an issue in the second semester I did not feel comfortable suddenly bringing it up. I only explain this here in case there are future Japanologists taking Literary Chinese with future undergraduates who want to use the class to converse in Mandarin (which may not happen again for a while-that specific combination).
