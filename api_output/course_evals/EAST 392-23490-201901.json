            "\u00a0The various interpretations and discussions about gender, buddhism, and sexuality were fabulously interesting and engaging; further, they are re-applicable to a wide variety of topics, scenarios, and discussion around religious studies, textual and social interpretation, and WGSS. Great food for thought about life. ",
            "\u00a0I understood the linkage between two vastly different topics and how religion plays a role in present-day society. I learned how to write my first research paper and also developed meaningful conversation and thought-provoking discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting look at the role sexuality and gender plays in religious spaces. ",
            "\u00a0This class opens your mind and teaches you to think differently. One of my favorite classes, by far, this class is driven by student-led discussion and can essentially be about whatever you would like. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible.  I'm so glad I decided to take it on a whim.  You learn so much about how religion and sexuality plays into so many different aspects of life.   I came out of this class with an entirely new perspective and new thoughts about the role religion and sexuality play in the world and my life.  The readings are very interesting -- I'd recommend doing them all . ",
            "\u00a0We read primary and secondary Buddhist literature and scripture about sex, sexuality, and gender from the historical origins of Buddhism up to the present, in different regions around the world. The difficulty with addressing 'Buddhism' is that it is not a homogeneous faith. In fact, there are drastic differences under the umbrella of traditions around the world. This class made sure to historicize and contextualize different Buddhist traditions through space and time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different Buddhist practices and their views on sexuality especially with concern to how cultural elements influence that perspective/ ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about various aspects of Buddhism(s) through a lens that actually centered intersectionality in its framework and discussed sexuality in a theoretical and also practical ways. We learned about and went in depth with certain pillars such as emptiness which were so enriching and important to engage with as I continue to grow and form and my sense of self. "

            "\u00a0It was very interesting content! I just wish that the lectures and student-led discussions had been focused on the actual readings and people's opinions rather than the more abstract concepts that they were. ",
            "\u00a0Good to discuss the readings with other people. Also nice to talk to people and see experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Kim is an absolute gem of a professor  so helpful, kind, and smart. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class - learned about a wide variety of different topics ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the course; Professor Kim was organized, clear, and picked interesting, relevant, and engaging readings that we discussed in class. The amount of work was perfect; it was a lot, but not too much. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of what was learned in class was student-driven. If students felt very strongly about a topic during class, a lot of the time it would be students expressing their thoughts on the reading and taking up time from Professor Kim's teachings. Then there was student-based discussion, which I felt like takes too long because a lot of students' reflections don't really build on each other's, it's more just people sharing what they feel. ",
            "\u00a0The reading responses are long and the discussion in class would benefit from some more moderation. Many people took this course as an introduction to Buddhism which I would strongly advise against. This course would benefit more from everyone being on a similar page about Buddhism and understanding the nuances of religious practice. Especially in the beginning, people made too many broad sweeping generalizations about Buddhism without any clear understanding of the different traditions or beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths would be the interesting material and Prof. Kim.  Weaknesses might be that sometimes it felt like our discussions weren't going anywhere, but I think that just depended on the topic ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course were very interesting, covering many many different categories. Even though this is Professor Kim's first year at Yale, it is obvious that he has thoughtfully developed this class from his time at Duke. I do wish that the class did have a cap on the number of students on it because the number ballooned up to nearly thirty students, but it was still a seminar. As a result, our class conversation was slow and more verbose than it needed to be. I have not taken other WGSS classes, but my impression is that this class was more of a survey on sexuality and gender studies than other classes would be. Professor Kim does a good job over the first few weeks to make sure that we cover the basics of Buddhism so that we could have informed discussions. ",
            "\u00a0It welcome critiques and different perspectives on Buddhism(s) such as on \"western Buddhism\" and does so in a way that's really accessible to students from all kind of backgrounds. It also was a great discussion space where everyone was really engaged and wanted to participate. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. This course is eye opening about sexual issues and philosophies surrounding different forms of Buddhism. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fun seminar that is chill, but really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student, just for a chance to study with Prof. Kim. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - Professor Kim is a fantastic professor ",
            "\u00a0Good reading + great professor. Scope out the other students taking the class during shopping period because the class if very student driven. This semester was good, but I could imagine the class becoming painful if there were some select individuals who didn't know how to behave in a section/seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Buddhism and Sexuality would be a fun fifth course, but I ended up learning so much from this course, probably more than my any other courses. I didn't know much about Buddhism prior to taking this course, but I learned a lot about Buddhism and even more about gender and sexuality. As someone who has taken multiple WGSS courses before, it was great to approach these issues in a fresh angle. The discussions were a lot of fun, albeit sometimes challenging and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend any class taught by Professor Kim regardless of your interests or studies. All the topics discussed in his course are relevant to life itself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Buddhism and sexuality are already interesting topics on their own but put together they're fascinating! You'll learn a fair bit about the two separately but also issues of sexuality in Buddhism and issues of sexuality outside Buddhism seen through a Buddhist lens. Readings and class discussions are always interesting, Prof Kim brings in amazing guest speakers, you can really explore any topic you want in depth through the final project/paper, and Prof Kim is great at explaining concepts and considering new viewpoints. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It was very fun and interesting, and it got me to reflect and think about my own stance on religion and gender issues today. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course as an introduction to Buddhism. I feel this course would be more interesting for everyone if they came in with some prior knowledge of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  Take it!  You will be so interested all the time. ",
            "\u00a0This semester, the only work requirements were weekly reading responses ~500 words, class participation, leading class discussion once, and the final ~15 page paper. The first three are fairly easy to manage, but I wish that I had more guidance on the final paper, as in a requirement to turn in a rough draft or some workshop with classmates. That being said, this class is super interesting and I would recommend it to a classmate. Professor Kim is an incredibly empathetic and knowledgable teacher and helpful mentor. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Kim is a gem  take the course just for the discussions he leads. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would! Professor Kim is amazing and the class was such a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0As a graduating senior, I would strongly recommend this course to any other student. The course is structured first around the theoretical underpinnings of Buddhism, of the context around its strictly heterosexual male origin, and extends toward a broader discussion of the 'queering' of this religion and its adoption by various lgbtq+ groups. The subject is inherently broad, but every seminar feels focused on a singular topic every week, from tantric sex rituals to modern sex robots (it sounds weird, but he makes it make sense). Professor Kim is very welcoming of all backgrounds and viewpoints, and while the various guest speakers he invited were different levels of engaging, some (like Kodo Nishimura, a gay Buddhist makeup artist) were spectacular, and were truly fascinating to hear from. I absolutely loved taking this course. "
