            "\u00a0Mohegan is a very fun and unique language. I learned as much about the language as I did the culture and people who spoke it. ",
            "\u00a0In Mohegan, everything is a verb. But seriously, this was a fun course despite not being able to really go deeper into the language seeing as there are no fluent speakers. "

        [
            "\u00a0This class was very interactive and everyone in the class was super involved in all of the learning activities. I felt great being in such an environment because I could ask a question and everyone - other students and Prof. Fielding - would try to find out the answer together. In terms of weaknesses, this class could have used a little more structure, but it doesn't mean that the class was disorganized. I think Prof. Fielding tried her best to make the language learning come intuitive and natural, which could have called for a less-structural approach. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't exactly learn much Mohegan, but that can't really be helped all things considered. It was always a good time though. I was always ready to march into class without fear or anxiety. "

            "\u00a0Not sure if Mogehan will be taught at Yale ever again, but if it is, I'd strongly recommend taking it. It's mostly a dead language now, and by studying the language, even just to gain linguistic insights, you're part of the effort that keeps the language alive. Linguistics and anthropology majors will find this class very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Nuks, wigun! You can't lose out on this course. Not that I think we're having again since the teacher is only here for the year, but the workload is so light that you might as well take it if you have any interest. "
