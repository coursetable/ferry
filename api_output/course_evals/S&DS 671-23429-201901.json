            "\u00a0Generally, I learned about the many tracks of research that are currently in place regarding neural nets. One particular skill I gained was from the first couple lectures, whose focus on approximation theory helped me figure out how to state a theorem for my research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about neural nets and the techniques used to analyze them ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory behind neural networks and how such topics are approached from the statistical side (vs the implementation side taught in other boring courses) ",
            "\u00a0This was way too hard for me, so not much ",
            "\u00a0Review of recent papers reporting theoretical developments in deep learning ",
            "\u00a0General overview of various topics related to neural nets ",
            "\u00a0Reading papers ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a lot about the current research being done with regards to neural nets. For me, taking this course helped me understand how people approach research in academia and helped me gain more experience working on theoretical material. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths are that it covers very fresh research and familiarizes the students with it. ",
            "\u00a0Good variety of papers presented, lectures interesting, workload was appropriate. Maybe having a tiny bit more work, e.g. a response required after each lecture, would be good encouragement to stay engaged throughout the whole lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the papers were a little tough and maybe you could provide additional notes to get people up to speed prior to the lectures ",
            "\u00a0Nice professor, but the papers discussed need to be explained at a higher level before delving into the proof. ",
            "\u00a0This course just reviews papers. Its exactly what is advertised. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturer. Could have more in terms of student engagement with assignments or in class participation to encourage deeper learning. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was very helpful as an overview to neural network theory and should be taken by anyone who wants to work in this field ",
