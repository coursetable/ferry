            "\u00a0I became a better writer and more interested in book history ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write, read, and discuss academic papers. I learned how to participate in writing workshops and how to seek out help from residential college writing tutors. ",
            "\u00a0Better essay writing skills, I became more concise and reflective in my essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped by writing structure and helped me to form better arguments. There was a heavy focus on claim development. We also spent a considerable amount of time debating in class and learning how to approach dense academic text. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my writing skills throughout this course, and the practice writing was beneficial. I also learned to think more critically about what I read, and I got a lot better at reading difficult and academic texts. I also now view books and the relationship between authorship, readers, and books differently; it's a lot more complicated than I previously realized and it made me reconsider some assumptions I hadn't thought carefully about. ",
            "\u00a0Definately helps become a more effective, clear, and structured writer. ",
            "\u00a0This class improved the general flow of my arguments as well as the logical construction of my writing. ",
            "\u00a0In taking ENGL 114, I have learned introductory writing skills, especially in the field of research, analytical, and expository papers. This course has definitely helped me improve as a writer, and this course is one that improves all aspects of writing: be it style, content, format, etc. My section (Section 12: What Is a Book? taught by James Eric Ensley) was a very well-organized course with a great instructor and great content. My section helped me develop arguments that discussed what truly makes a book a book. Every section discusses a different topic, and some instructors will go over different material than others, so I must say that choosing a good section is imperative to enjoying this course. Shop other sections to see which section you see yourself enjoying the most. "

            "\u00a0It's an awesome class!!!  No weaknesses whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Beinecke visits and overall 114 imposed structure, I don't think it needs improvement ",
            "\u00a0The course focused too much on course's topic, book history, and too little on the course's main objective, writing. The instructor assigned extremely dense and esoteric papers that much of the class struggled to read and understand, often leading to discussions that were not based on the text itself. The instructor provided very little feedback for writing assignments and spent very little time discussing writing strategies, mechanics, and the like during class. We were assigned chapters to read from a writing manual. These were discussed very briefly and then never referenced again. Overall, the course was less of a writing seminar, and more of a directionless discussion of book history with papers attached. While my writing improved throughout the course, I feel like I could have made more significant gains under a teacher more dedicated to instructing students on writing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the engaging teaching style and accessible instructor. The only weakness for me in the course was that the weekly readings became a little repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was the peer review and the drafts we had to do before handing in our final essay; they helped me improve and narrow down my writing. However, I thought the course had a few too many readings as many of them were long and confusing and they didn't always lead to good discussions. Buying the writing book at the beginning of class was also totally unnecessary and an annoying waste of money. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Eric is absolutely fantastic and not only is he super accessible, but he also takes the time to make sure you understand and are doing well. ",
            "\u00a0First, I want to say that each section will vary, since each section is taught by a different instructor, and each section discusses a different topic. For instance, mine was What Is a Book, which I think was one of the best sections for this course. The course was very well organized, and overall, every student had a great time in discussion and writing the papers. One value that is strong in this course (especially in my section) was the feedback given on each paper: the instructor went through each paper and gave relevant feedback to help you improve as a writer. Also, the discussions were interesting and brought in quotes and pieces from our readings that aided in our understanding of the book, and how multi-faceted the definition of a book is. One aspect of this course that is neither a strength nor a weakness is the assignments near the end of the course did not tie in well with the discussions in class. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the later assignments (and I hope this structure of this course will not change because of my opinion), the discussions seemed separate from what we were writing. However, the earlier assignments tied in very well with the discussions. However, I must reiterate that this is not a strength nor a weakness, just an observation that should remain unchanged. But to the student that is reading this, the ENGL 114 course will vary depending on the section, so find a good section (like James Eric Ensley's section). This course can be very helpful and enjoyable or it can be terrible and unbearable. For me, though, it was very helpful. One weakness, though, is that I did not use the textbook often enough for me to rationalize renting the textbook: we had two readings from it and then I did not use it after that (except as evidence for my last essay). ",
            "\u00a0The topics discussed in class were really interesting, more than what I had expected from a writing class "

        [
            "\u00a0Unless you are interested in an extremely niche topic of book history, I would not recommend this course. Especially if you are interested in improving your writing, choose another instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who is a lover of books and experimentation, as theres a lot of fun to be had. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I liked the seminar style writing course and I think the incorporation of semester long theme really helped with engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, I really liked the teacher and thought he made an effort to listen to us and make class interesting. Although I found the subject more interesting than I initially thought I would, it still wasn't fascinating and many of the readings were a bit dry. However, the class discussions and the teacher made up for this so I enjoyed the class and would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Ues! Great introductory writing course for academic essays. No matter what your experience is when it comes to writing, this is an excellent course to start with or get better aquanted with academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0good teacher who truly wants to improve your writing and an interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student (especially my section What Is a Book?). This course helps the student write college-level papers, and the instructors (at least mine: James Eric Ensley) give great feedback so that you may improve your writing. However, you only get out what you put into the asssignments: meaning that if you put in a lot of work, you will get a lot out of it. I put in only a moderate amount of work, and I wish I put in more so that my writing would be better. Nonetheless, though, I still emerged learning a lot about how to be a great writer, and I strongly recommend taking this course. This course is centered more around research papers and expository essays, though, and that should be taken into consideration. ENGL 120, however, is more centered around a creative form of the essay (such as writing an essay on an interview you conducted or a place) rather than drawing evidence from articles you have read and making a claim for something in your essay.
