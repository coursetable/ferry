            "\u00a0Strengths: Pak Indriyo is great. Give the man tenure. His first and foremost concern is teaching and making sure we learn -- not all professors are like that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A little disorganized. Emails sent out at absurd times (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 a.m. emails are the norm. Be prepared for an assignment due in class to be mailed out at 4 a.m. the day of at least once). ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - Indonesian was a fun course. I was always excited to come to class. the Professor was really cool. Weaknesses - it took ages to get our tests and homework back. Sometimes months and i really found this was quite annoying. Also I kind of wish we had a real book for class and not just like a bunch of worksheets ",

            "\u00a0I would. Firstly, Indonesian is actually an easy language to pick up and be relatively competent in speaking/writing/reading. Secondly, Pak Indriyo is a caring, hilarious teacher and his anecdotes are 10/10. Third, you can put a ton of effort into this course when you have the time/are able but during those hell weeks for other classes you can basically do nothing besides show up -- it's a very take-your-own-path type course. \r\n\r\nAlso, the TA we had (Yudhis!) here on the Fulrbright is the GOAT. Absolute best TA at Yale, they should bring him on to faculty. ",
