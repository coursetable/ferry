            "\u00a0Justin had such a grasp of the doctrines and principles we studied this semester and he  was really able to ask deep probing questions that got us all thinking in section. He was the able to display great patience as we teased them both methodically and systematically. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is simply brilliant and has ready access to rich material. He is a good facilitator of conversation, managing the section well. He also does a fantastic job offering helpful critiques on papers. The problem is that the sections ended up being discussion of one of two readings, sometimes off tempo from the lectures (this was due to the professor's absences that seemed to impact the schedule). Per above comment, a better task for section might have been to assess the project more holistically - what was Jennings trying to do and how did the readings relate to that? I don't think this was the TA's issue - its more course design. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is organized, warm, forgiving, encouraging and funny. It was all good. He paid meticulous attention to our written work and gave very detailed feedback. I really appreciated his generosity and teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Justin's section was by far my favorite I have had at YDS so far. We had a great group of people who were engaged with the topics, and Justin led us adeptly through confusion or tricky topics. He did a great job facilitating discussion and making sure everyone had a chance to talk and that people could ask questions without fear of being made to look foolish. In fact, he seemed to take great joy in answering our questions, or redirecting them back to the rest of us for discussion. His passion for and interest in theological discussion is evident. I wish this section could have been twice as long because we always had to stop while we were in the middle of really interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, he was dedicated to our learning and always willing to spend time working through individual issues and answering questions for us on his own time. His mastery of the subject is impressive; I'm pretty sure he could easily teach this class himself. But then, he also clearly respects Dr. Jennings a great deal and did an incredible job of facilitating our learning the way that Dr. Jennings wanted him to. Justin collaborated regularly with the other TF Wendy, and they work really well together, which made our experience in the class seamless.\r\n\r\nI also really appreciated Justin's feedback on my written work. It's obvious he spent a lot of time with our work and took it seriously, not just so he could give it a grade but so he could engage with our thinking and help us make our theological inquiry stronger. ",
            "\u00a0Fr. Justin is outstanding. I can suggest nothing to improve his teaching. He consistently enabled the class to find their own voices and opine.  No class ever dragged on. Questions were focused to draw us in and cause us to think.  Simply outstanding. One of the better sections I have attended while at YDS. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was a fantastic section leader. He helped to create an environment where people were not only willing but wanting to share with the group - and the discussions that we did end up having were insightful and meaningful to those present. Justin knew his stuff, and found a great balance between leading a discussion and helping to pick it up where it may have dropped a bit. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was such a wonderful teaching fellow that had a really big impact on the way I understood systematic theology. His insight and willingness to drive the conversations to where we needed to go while simultaneously leaving room for others to give their own perspectives and reflections was something I really appreciated. He gave honest feedback and really pushed us to see the larger picture of what we we were discussing. Also, his availability to us outside of the classroom was something I very much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Great! Justin is on point and does a good job of asking questions that engage the class and get multiple perspectives talking. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was incredible. He's a phenomenal teacher and brilliant theologian. I really appreciated that he was not shy to go up to the chalk board in section and explain things to us more clearly when no one understood it enough to discuss. Justin has the ability to explain difficult concepts in a clear straightforward way. He also has the amazing ability of keeping a discussion section interesting, asking all the right questions, filling the gaps when no one else was talking, and encouraging everyone to speak - even those of us who are more quiet. Great Teaching Fellow all around and really wonderful, approachable person. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is able to articulate what students are trying to say, both in section and in writings, and speak to their strengths and weaknesses. No weaknesses come to mind. He was wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Justin was always present and engaging during discussions making sure to solicit comments from all students. ",
            "\u00a0I do not find any weakness in Justin as a Teaching Fellow. He is one of the most considerate and smart fellow I have ever met. I really appreciate his knowledge and especially facilitation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Justin Crisp is an excellent TF. This is the second time I have worked with him as TF in a theology course, and I find his presentation, explanations and discussion illuminating. He is able to draw out discussion from the group--including the quiet, introverted members, and resolves all confusions quickly and concisely. He does great explanatory diagrams that are memorable and clarifying. He should be teaching a course at YDS because he has such a firm grip on the material at hand and is so well-organized and clear. He is generous with his advice and direction, and always willing to work with the situation at hand. Keep him as a TF as long as possible--and if he  can be assigned a class to teach, he would be great! Medieval Theology comes to mind. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent in every way! ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a great TF. He is available for conversation outside of class, a great class facilitator, and a really solid teacher. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions really deepened my understanding of the readings and helped tie things together. ",
            "\u00a0He is very happy and he always encourages us to talk and he helps us to understand Prof. Jennings' lecture very well. ",
            "\u00a0Good knowledge of material, helped pull out ideas to help us better understand material.\r\n\r\nA little slow to get conversation started when students struggled to figure out what was going on in readings.\r\n\r\nPoor feedback/hard to understand feedback on papers. Took so long to return that comments were of no use on future work. ",
            "\u00a0She was a great facilitator! ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was great! She was sensitive to the various points of view represented in the readings, and also clearly really knows theology. I will say, I wish Wendy had been more firm in leading us through class according to the plan she announced at the start of section, because I felt like sometimes time got away from us and we couldn't do everything she planned, but it wasn't always because we were having such a deep theological discussion, so I think Wendy could have pushed us onward and we might have gotten more out of section that way. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy is very kind and prompt in her responses to emails. I sometimes felt that when going over feedback from papers, she couldn't really articulate how to improve some of the things she had requested be bettered, which made it a little confusing for improving on assignments. I would also say that while she facilitated discussion well in section, I often felt like we were just summarizing what authors had written and didn't really get much out of the sections. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was a very good facilitator. She was in command of the material and used small group work as a good way to prompt discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I can not say enough good things about Wendy in her role as a Teaching Fellow. She has a thorough knowledge of the material and easily referenced the work and beliefs of different theologians on the many different topics we covered. She skillfully brought the theologians of our reading material into conversation with each other and Prof Jennings. \r\n\r\nWendy's teaching style worked well with students of different knowledge and comprehension levels. She could just as easily have an in-depth discussion on one detailed theological point as to give a basic review of the lecture material to someone who was struggling with the material. In both cases, she would meet the student where they were and encourage learning.\r\n\r\nHer expertly led the weekly section sessions. Each week was a little different and included everybody in the discussion to the level of their comfort.\r\n\r\nI also greatly appreciated the thoughtful, detailed feedback I received on the case studies. Wendy obviously dedicated a lot of time to ensure we learned from the assignments. Excellent! ",
            "\u00a0The TF was very slow to provide feedback to assignments. We received feedback with little or no time to make improvements. \r\nThe TF was very respectful in sections.\r\nThe sections did not dig deep into the material and were often not very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was very friendly and helpful and a good section leader overall. The only thing I would say is that she could do a better job of keeping time so that we don't go over. ",
            "\u00a0Consistently prepared, demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the subject far beyond what was covered in class and was thus able to give thoughtful answers to students' questions. Fostered engaging, respectful discussion in section. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was very conscientious in our section about making sure a variety of viewpoints were heard. She was available outside of lecture and section to discuss topics and/or the class.  I think her teaching could be improved by taking charge of section discussion and directing it more - often it didn't feel like our discussions went anywhere or covered new material or synthesized what we'd done in class. ",
            "\u00a0We had a very short amount of time in our sections to work through the readings we had been assigned for that week. Given the time constraint I felt that the discussion questions could have been more pointed. We were often just barely beginning to summarize each reading when section would end. I felt like section could have been more helpful had we focused on one driving inquiry pertaining to the lecture/readings for that week instead of trying to summarize the main points of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was great! Her feedback, written and in person, was delivered with grace. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was a kind and encouraging presence in the classroom, who carried her work as a theologian visibly and helpfully, which was a nice example for the rest of us. I often wished Wendy would have been more assertive in her invitations for discussionit seemed as though in her effort to acquiesce to student interest, it became more difficult than it would have been to address questions at hand. Despite this, I think Wendy will be an effective force in the classroom as she gains more teaching experience. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was exceptional leading section. "
