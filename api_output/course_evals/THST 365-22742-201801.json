            "\u00a0This class is a broad survey of major works in American dramatic theater dating from the 1960s to the present. Since you're doing two plays a week, you really get a good sense for the important trends and can begin to draw connections between the works. There's a great diversity of voices represented on the syllabus (though not in the makeup of the actual class), which made for a really fascinating class. It's a very student-driven seminar, which was nice because the students in my class were super sharp. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a wide-ranging familiarity with the works of the nation's most important playwrights as well as an understanding of the significance and effectiveness of their written theatrical strategies. Furthermore, by writing about the works and placing them in conversation with one another, I developed the skills to compare and contrast dramatic texts and modes of theatricality. ",
            "\u00a0This course somewhat addressed the historical/biographical side of playwriting during this era, but mostly is centered on textual analysis. The syllabus is great, and I felt like I got a broad taste of contemporary drama. ",
            "\u00a0Robinson is so brilliant and I learn so much from just hearing him talk about shows he likes and dislikes. But I also learned a ton about theater history and theater development. And I read some amazing plays! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this classnew ways of thinking about theatre, of reading plays, of writing about drama, of approaching productions, of close-reading, and of being a thoughtful person. I now feel comfortable having a conversation about American drama in the second half of the 20th century, and feel much more prepared to analyze and thoughtfully respond to theatre I see and make now. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new ways of approaching dramatic texts and thinking about theatre. ",
            "\u00a0Very methodical approach to works of American Drama after 1960 -- two plays a week allows for an indepth look but also a broad enough scope to understand the main ideas that Professor Robinson expresses ",
            "\u00a0Approaches to the hermeneutics and phenomenology of American drama given contemporary experiments with form, language, and structure. A central focus of the class was the ways in which characters use language towards specific ends, and this was a helpful approach to understanding how effective plays drive themselves forward. It was also great to hear a wide range of acclaimed voices dealing with the central problems of dramatic form. "

            "\u00a0The reading responses should be due earlier in the week (maybe two days before class, rather than the day before) and students should be required to engage with each other's comments before coming to class. Also, I think Professor Robinson should assign a few essays to help contextualize the time periods some of these plays are set in. I think it would be particularly helpful to read about second-wave feminism before doing Wendy Wasserstein, for example. He sometimes touched on context (esp. with Spalding Gray) with videos and interviews, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a fantastic syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The class was way too big. I would cap it at 18 for real. Even though that seems cutthroat, it pays off in the long run. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Incredibly diverse reading list, full of something for everyone. \r\n-Reasonable yet challenging workload. And extremely fun assignments! I wanted to do all the work. \r\n-Professor Robinson is extraordinary: accessible, brilliant, respectful, thorough, and kind. and truly cares about what he does \r\n-great blend of engaging lecture elements that provide context for discussions and writing and open-ended discussions\r\n-wonderful and helpful feedback on your writing \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-none. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course are incredible and the discussions are equally well-facilitated. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Really engaging reading list. The seminar could be smaller than it was. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were incredibly organic and meaningful, and Professor Robinson never let a moment of silence come about by always filling the time with really insightful comments. Only weakness I could imagine is just that I sometimes felt that themes between authors weren't as connected as I would've wished. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the discussion was often too focussed on formal considerations at the expense of content. Many of the plays we read seemed to make large philosophical claims, and focussing on little details in the use of language and footnotes and parantheticals often distracted from gaining a clear understanding of the central expression of the work. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you're interested in theater or performance history, absolutely take this. Also, consider taking Professor Robinson's fall course! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This course somewhat addressed the historical/biographical side of playwriting during this era, but mostly is centered on textual analysis. The syllabus is great, and I felt like I got a broad taste of contemporary drama. Marc Robinson is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! Take anything Marc Robinson teaches. His mannerisms are so dear, and he's entirely brilliant. The syllabus is good. The workload is manageable. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Robinson is absolutely breathtaking and the plays on the syllabus will change your life. I was excited to do the work for this class every week and never wanted to stop talking or thinking about the plays we were reading. Professor Robinson does a great job of blending elements of lecture with genuine discussion. Conversation was always fascinating and engaging, and the atmosphere of the class was one of respect yet intense inquiry. I never felt judged by Professor Robinson, and he was willing to entertain all sorts of ideas and consider them respectfully. He gives incredible feedback on writing assignments (that is quite helpful) and is familiar with not only the texts we read for class, but with the playwrights' lives and other works, the context in which works were done, and their performance histories. He brings in supplementary quotes, videos, and photos, which always made discussions more lively and engaging. And his brief lecture-like introductions to each class were always inspiring and enriched conversation a great deal. You dont want to miss the chance to read these works with somebody as brilliant and wonderful as Marc Robinson. ",
            "\u00a0I 100% would recommend this course. The material is fascinating and the professor is brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Robinson is a really great professor - cares about his students original ideas and is incredibly knowledgeable about theater. I really loved the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course for those who have and those who don't have experience in this field. Plus Professor Robinson is simply incredible. He accepts and furthers all comments made in class, and his eloquence made class so enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  The syllabus is full of interesting, thought-provoking plays that I wasn't certain I would enjoy but which I was surprised to find I really did.  There's a great variety of material covered, and Professor Robinson is wonderful at facilitating quirky, interesting discussions on it all.  It's a great class, whether or not you've studied drama before--the two papers are very manageable, and Professor Robinson is a very kind and fair grader.  Overall, I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. "
