            "\u00a0Not much knowledge or insights or skills learned aside from what was self-taught from the textbook, which is problematic as the textbook is dense, not really well written or engaging, and hard to really comprehend. Our professor did teach in class and held a lot of office hours, and she did really try her best! There's nothing wrong with her personally, but no one in the class could really understand the material. It's just a difficult course. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot about matrices, vector geometry, a bit about multivariable calculus and optimization ",

            "\u00a0A relatively basic level of multivariable calculus and linear algebra. Strategies were largely application based. ",
            "\u00a0I enriched my knowledge in Math and learned useful techniques for future Economics courses I am planning to take. ",
            "\u00a0Looking back, I feel like I learned very little math. This class felt too ambitious to the point where I just was learning how to do different types of problems every week for psets or tests while understanding very little of what I was doing. By the end of the semester, I couldnt say I understood linear algebra or multi variable much and just felt like I memorized a bunch of steps to complete similar problems. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very much about learning how to carry out mathematical processes and not about why you are carrying them out. I did not feel it contributed to a deeper conceptual understanding of math, but rather gave me useful practical tools/formulas for specific goals. ",
            "\u00a0linear algebra skills:\r\n- matrix manipulation\r\n- using matrices to solve population distribution problems\r\n- spans, subspaces, and bases\r\n- orthogonal vectors, projections\r\n\r\nmultivariable skills:\r\n- basic differentiation\r\n- visualization\r\n- optimization with Lagrange multipliers\r\n\r\nThis course gave me a good idea of the basic concepts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus without having to take multiple classes. There was also a focus on this math in an economics context. "

            "\u00a0The size of the class and the different dynamics were good but I wish more connections to other areas were done (e.g. economics) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor vigliotta is very nice, and tries her best to teach and explain. Small class size means more personalized attention, can ask questions in class. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: material is hard, the textbooks aren't great in explaining it. Wish we had lecture notes or a ppt to refer back to, especially if you missed lecture and don't understand the book. ",
            "\u00a0The array of topics covered in the class is very useful, however, sometimes I felt like it was too broad. We spent too little time on some topics, which did not allow me to develop a more profound understanding of the subject. Besides that, I think that doing more practice problems (especially more real-life problems) in class would be very helpful.\r\nI appreciated that we were always encouraged to ask for clarifications in the class - it was definitely very helpful and made the course very engaging!\r\nIn terms of further improvements, I wish they were more office hours and peer tutors and more sample tests to practice before exams! ",

            "\u00a0The course is very strong in its set-up and order of concepts. I always felt like what I was learning was interesting or meaningful. Professor Vigliotta is an amazing professor and is always around to help during ample office hours. One way to improve the course, maybe, would be to add some material to the course to widen its scope a little. Some of linear is still ungrounded for me for example. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that it is very straight forward. The teacher teaches exactly what you are gonna be tested on so there is little confusion when it comes to examinations. A weakness is that it does not require a lot of individual thinking, but rather a lot of memorization of methods and steps used to solve the problems. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like this course didnt focus enough on teaching the actual mathematical concepts, but focused more on getting through the material. Because if this, I cant say I actually understood anything we went over. I thought Professor V was extremely helpful and kind in helping students understand the material, but just dont think Math 118 is the best class for people seriously trying to learn applicable math for Econ. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers an appropriate amount of material for the time allocated. Weekly problem sets help with cementing material learnt in class time. \r\nAdditional time could be given to exploration of real-world applications of the material - perhaps instead of certain problem sets, investigations could be assigned.

            "\u00a0I mean, only take it if you need to for a requirement or if you need to know the math for another class/major. It is better than Math 120, because it is smaller and focuses on concepts needed for economics. ",
            "\u00a0A hidden gem of math requirements. Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely better than 115 and 120! So if you are looking for some basic understanding of matrices and mutivariable calculus, take it! ",

            "\u00a0No. If possible, i definitely would recommend just doing the 115 and 120 sequence. I think this class is a weird filler math course that doesnt offer very much practical knowledge, even if youre an Econ major. ",
            "\u00a0This course is exactly what it says it will be - an introduction to linear algebra and differential mulitvariable calculus. If that is something that you are interested in and adequately prepared to take, I would recommend this course as it has been well structured and taught to facilitate effective learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great option if you dont need to take Math 120 and a linear course. The workload was very manageable and the exams were not too hard. Psets can sometime feel a little tedious but they arent egregious. If you want to get a bit of exposure to linear algebra without committing to a hard math class, take Math 118. But if you want a solid foundation, Id say take the traditional track instead. "
