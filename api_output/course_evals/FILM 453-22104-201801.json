            "\u00a0I learned so much from both my professors and my classmates, about the ethics of making documentary work, the nuances of subjectivity, the many different forms of documentary that exist, and about its leaders-- we even got to meet some of them! ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH. Best introduction to documentary studies in every possible manner. Especially the critical evaluation of practice and theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically interrogate the form and content and intention of documentary. I could not have asked for a better course. ",
            "\u00a0We covered the foundations of documentary work and different types of documentaries, eg photography, audio, film, new digital media etc. I have better insight into the differences of documentary and journalistic photography/video, have seen important works from each field and had learned about the ethics of the profession. The course doesn't cover/require hands-on skills in documentary ",
            "\u00a0I wrestled with topics of ethical documentary work, the purpose of documentary, and the strengths and weaknesses of different mediums of documentary. ",
            "\u00a0An intro course on the history of documentary work and the ethical concerns raised by the form. ",
            "\u00a0New perspectives to think about the medium. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0One of the major strengths of this course is the respect that the professors give student opinion. There was never a moment of silence, and most of the talking was from the students-- this kind of environment is not always the easiest to find! Even though we stopped talking about the readings as much by the end, the discussions were so rich that it was worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Only strengths -- the most evident being the two gems of instructors! Very well structured, very engaging and life-changing to say the least. We had so much fun in class and at the same time, engaged in very meaningful discussion. The open nature assignments was very conducive to good writing and criticism. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really incredible. I appreciated the back and forth between the professors and the way the course built over time through different media. Sometimes we strayed from discussing the readings but that was because our own conversations were so good. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions are amazing, almost everyone in the class is really engaged in every topic. The reading/viewing assigned is almost always also super interesting. Nothing to complain about! ",
            "\u00a0Readings were quite long and hard to address in the two classes each week. I would suggest shorter readings that could be discussed more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, TA, and syllabus. The group of students picked were very diverse in knowledge, identity, and experience, yet our conversations often got stuck on the same couple of issues, leaving the majority of the topics untouched. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized plan to lead students through the concept of documentary. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Anyone interested in the narrative formation behind podcasts, radio, documentary film, and photographs would fall in love with this course. The professors do a nice job of getting a variety of students into the room, and for that reason, conversations are always rich. I learned as much from my classmates as I did from my professors, and fostered with that great friendships. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A Yale gem. If you think you are at all interested in documentary or even curious, try to get in. ",
            "\u00a0YES, please take this course. You will not only learn the basics of documentary but you will get to interrogate the genre's epistemology across forms. Important if you want to think about the work you do and how you're doing it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely take this class if you get in, it will lead to some of the greatest discussions about the scope, importance, and ethics of documentaries, and you'll usually also have guest documentary makers talk about their experiences. Great survey of documentary work (not limited to film and especially not limited to \"old-style\" docs) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, intro to documentary studies bridges so many disciplines and is a fascinating topic to learn about ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely.  Matt and Anna are fantastic, class discussion was always dynamic, the reading list was rich, and the writing assignments were challenging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! Matt and Anna are both great, and you will learn SO MUCH by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for the professors alone this is a great class. The speakers were impressive too. "
