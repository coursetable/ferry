            "\u00a0I strongly developed my calculus skills from the level which I had at high school. I developed time managing skills due to the pset and exams requiring a lot of time to prepare. I also learnt that I should reach out for help if I dont understand something. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a new way to approach mathematics. The enthusiasm of my professor helped me to appreciate what I was learning. Not only that but I learned how to study more effectively and that carried over to all my other classes. ",

            "\u00a0The course-based tutors were a major strength of this course. I often found that, while lecture provided a good introduction to the material, the course-based tutors, as students who had taken the course before, provided helpful insight and tips that led me to understand the material more fully. The textbook was also a great strength in that it was much easier to follow than textbooks in some other courses I have taken, and I felt that the readings and the lectures interacted well with one another to reinforce learning. It might be helpful to do more independent exercises in class that we check together, just to make sure that we understand concepts before leaving class. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think there was enough in class practice of the concepts that we learned at a more basic level before they progressed to the applications of the concepts which made it very hard to transfer skills and solve more complex problems ",
            "\u00a0more clear communication of expectations of concepts ",
            "\u00a0The PSETs were helpful and I felt as though they prepared me well for the exams. The use of WebAssign felt like somewhat useless, both for the student and professor. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that there is an incredible amount of resources offered for help at any given time with peer tutoring, office hours, and review sessions for exams. The weaknesses are that the PSETS are all hand-written and tend to be long and challenging, however as previously mentioned, peer tutors tend to provide lots of help for them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include class participation like how Ian made us talk in pairs a lot. This kept us engaged. I feel like there needs to be a class or two before each exam summarising. I also found it hard how the way this class was set us was so you were doing questions on the web assign before being taught the material . ",
            "\u00a0I feel that there is a definite weakness with the problem sets, as it is incredibly easy to do them passively but this weakness is all dependent on the students effort. So it was a weakness for me because I let it be. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very fast paced. The homework was often extremely difficult and did not match up with what was taught in class or in the textbook. I do not feel like I learned from the homework and ended up having to figure things out from YouTube or from a fellow classmate. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the small class environment that made learning more intimate. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the professors classes. I think the tutoring sessions could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses: the webassign was extremely expensive and not helpful. The practice another version part shouldve been enabled since tougher versions of problems in the homework were not practiced in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course I think is well structured and efficient. However, I was personally disappointed when I found out that I had seen much of what the course contained. As an international student, I wasn't aware enough about what AB calculus was, so I found this class quite repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of this course was the professor I was taught by. He explained concepts clearly in class and put great focus on how different concepts were applicable. He also gave us plenty of helpful example questions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Problemsets were a struggle. This could improve by attending more review sessions ",
            "\u00a0Strength of this course is that the professors truly go in DEPTH to the concepts sometimes to much though. \r\n\r\nCon is that some of the review sessions and stuff were not helpful, especially when the course is so fast. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class portion of this course was good, and Professor Adelstein was a very good instructor.  Otherwise, the problem sets and homework sometimes didn't correlate with the examples and problems done in class (difficulty-wise). ",
            "\u00a0The class could be improved by assigning the Web Assigns after the material is covered in lecture, instead of before. This would enable students to do practice problems with a good understanding of the material, instead of struggling to figure out the concepts. A strength of the course is the informative lectures, and a weakness is the problem sets, which were much more difficult than anything covered in class or on the midterms or final. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well taught and well paced thanks to Ian. I think he did a good job providing us with relevant examples. It could be improved if we had more reflective practice tests. ",
            "\u00a0Grading little unfavorable. Like one mess up on a circle the right answer question either gave you +10 on the midterm or -10. I wish more tests were like the final. Very fair however in terms of material covered. Homework was consistent. Past review materials were aplenty. ",
            "\u00a0the Webassigns were very pointless. I learned nothing from them and they took up way too much time. they were also very finicky. otherwise the course was taught very well and I learned a ton. it moved at a very good pace. ",
            "\u00a0In class if we went over any examples at all they were extremely basic and nothing compared to what we were tested on in the problem sets or the tests. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a very well designed course. There was a great balance of in class work, lectures, tests, quizzes, and psets. ",
            "\u00a0Class was very boring, especially being that I had already previously learned all the information. The grading of the tests was extremely meticulous and at times unfair. The webassigns weren't helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  teachers open to meeting up, peer tutors were helpful and kind\r\nWeaknesses: course layout is poor. The simplest version of a concept is taught in class with very few examples. This makes homework  and tests very hard. ",
            "\u00a0The course has an appropriate workload, the material is challenging but doable. The only weakness is the disproportionately difficult problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of the course was all of the review sessions for each exam, the peer tutoring sessions, and the practice exams. All these aspects made sure you understood the information before walking into an assessment, and if it weren't for them I wouldn't have done as well as I did. Peer tutors were great and making sure you understood the problems in the problem sets and the practice exams gave a good idea of what was to be expected on exams so you weren't blindsided. I think that having feedback for your grade on a problem set could be improved, often I did not know why I got points off or from where. In addition, I think some review sessions were much better than others, since all the professors taught the same concepts in different ways, so making sure they were all easily understood would be better.

            "\u00a0yes but I would warn them that they will at some point in the semester get very annoyed and frustrated with the Webassigns. If they know to expect this they will do fine. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a very good course and a great basis for furthering Calc knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0No. Unless you have to  take math for your major, do not take Math 112. This class was difficult and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend this course with Professor Ian Adelstein. The course was so insightful that I found the material exciting (and I am not a math guy)! The coursework is engaging and challenging, but there are several resources to overcome this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you need to take or have already taken calculus. If you haven't taken calculus before or have never been exposed to any of the concepts, it will be a bit challenging, but if you have taken calculus before, even if you did badly, you should be fine because a lot of the course is a review of concepts from AP Calculus AB.
