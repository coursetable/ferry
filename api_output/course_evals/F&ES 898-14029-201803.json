A huge insight that I have been able to takeaway as a result of this course is that in order to even achieve any environmental protection policy action, it is useful and very important to relate the benefits directly to human health. If one can do so, then the odds of passing legislation increase dramatically. ",

            "\u00a0I thought it was geared towards FES students who probably haven't take intro Epi classes. So it was below what is typically taught for MPH students but the papers that were reviewed were high level and we did take a lot of time to discuss and interpret what was being studied exactly. ",
            "\u00a0Well ",
            "\u00a0This class met my expectations fairly well. Sometimes it seemed like we learned topics in fairly broad/vague terms, however that may be expected of an introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I was expecting more information on different threats to human health. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings and reading responses in this class...I also enjoyed the discussion we had around the papers in class. The students came from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines so hearing their critiques of the papers brought to light things I had not initially noticed. I would have enjoyed more instruction by the professor. Most of the class was guest lecturers and student presentations and I was disappointed by the level of teaching the professor actually did. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Liked that guest speakers brought in, loved the QCCs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion leader assignment was very flexible so sometimes, we did not even get to discuss because discussion leaders took the whole time to summarize the articles. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses for this course. There are many strengths, however. Those include a broad topic range that touches on many important issues relating to human health and the environment. It was also very interesting and beneficial to hear from a wide range of speakers as well as Professor Bell and Kate. The reading material was excellent as well as the assignments due throughout the course. The QCCs forced me to think in a way I never had before regarding more technical scientific studies and it was extremely beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that students presented papers each week because each student has a unique background and could bring that to their topic. Some of the guest lectures were not presented in a way that was geared towards teaching new topics but rather talking about their experiences. ",
            "\u00a0-I liked the discussion format of the course and the opportunity for extensive student participation. This really helped not only with keeping me engaged in class, but also with ensuring that I actually did the readings before class and spent time on my own critically thinking and preparing. \r\n-I enjoyed the guest lecturers and the opportunity to learn about new areas of research from experts in the respective fields\r\n-The course format got a bit repetitive- while I enjoyed the format of lecture + student presentations + guest lectures, the fact that this was all we did all semester got a bit tiresome. The QCCs were interesting to write, but essentially we did not do anything except analyze papers all semester. Some greater variety in the assignments and class format would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This probably won't happen, but why not scrap the student presentations and just teach us more about environmental health problems? I guess it's good practice, but I was more interested in acquiring further substantive knowledge about topics that we skipped to make room for these presentations. Also, maybe more input from Michelle on the guest lectures would be beneficial. For example, the climate change one was too basic and much too long. I think Michelle should just do this lecture in the future; she said that she's not an expert, but she would have been better. And the built environment one was very interesting but a lot of it went over my head. And the occupational exposure one was too specifically about exposure in the medical context and glossed over all other employment contexts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in the breadth of topics covered and the number of guest lectures by experts who conduct the studies we discussed. There really was not a significant weak portion of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course are the class discussions. A weakness of the course is that our learning is narrowly tailored to the articles we are reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think Environmental Justice should be two days as should Climate Change.\r\nOccupational Health was kind of confusing as was built environment. Seems hard to find environmental specialists in these areas I guess because they spoke mainly in terms of their industry. I think I would instead do case studies on these days.\r\nI also think that there are ample opportunities for examination of this stuff in New Haven. Like URI has done a lot of work with homes that have lead in them... It would be nice to have some local context. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear presentation of material and expectations of students. Thorough student engagement with a variety of scientific journal articles gave students perspectives on research methods, suitable research questions, and challenges in environmental public health research. Guest lecturers provide valuable insight into the breadth of the field of environmental public health.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Given that it is a seminar course and nearly half of the lectures were led by guest lecturers, there was not a strong continuity of narrative. This made it hard at times to get into rhythm for the guest lectures, and I often found myself learning best when Professor Bell was teaching. Of the guest lectures, I found Prof. Deziel's and Dr. Whittaker's to be the most interesting, and valuable. While I think the other professors have a lot to offer to the group, their presentation material often felt too adjacent to the framework of the course, and I think better guidance could have been provided to help the class process their material better.

            "\u00a0The course is slightly redundant to other environmental classes if you are a public health student, especially and environmental health student so you might not get too much new information out of the class. Some of the lecturers you may have already heard from as a public health student. I do think the class teaches you how to read critically and think through complex papers so in that sense I would recommend this course to people. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Improved my ability to understand and critique peer review articles ",
            "\u00a0I would tell any prospective student that this class provides foundational learning for future policy use. Even if your main interest is not environmental epidemiology or is even if your main interest coming into F&ES is vastly different from that, this course provides perspectives and information that can help anybody interested in future environmental policy planning and communications greatly. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an MPH student, definitely take this class if you are looking for an immersive experience to read great environmental studies and learn how environmental health research works. ",
            "\u00a0Read the articles carefully, and don't miss a guest presentation! They're amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introduction to the field of environmental health sciences and focuses on critiquing published literature in the field. However, if you already know about EHS topics then this course may be too basic, as it covers the topics at a very broad level. ",
            "\u00a0Come to class prepared to contribute to class discussion and to listen. ",
            "\u00a0Be patient with yourself as you read the articles. Don't worry if you don't understand everything. ",
            "\u00a0Only pursue this class if you are interested in how scientists in the environmental public health space conduct their research and grapple with challenges. These concepts are taught quite effectively in the course, and the science covered produces very relevant findings that are powerful in motivating policy related to environmental harms. If however, you lack interest in this science, the course will be frustrating for you, as there is an expectation you read 2 or more scientific journal articles per week. "
