            "\u00a0This class provides a great intro to modeling in econ and it gives a good overview of what monetary policy is, what challenges there are, how it is implemented and the 2008 crisis. ",
            "\u00a0I dove deeper into the topics of intro/intermediate macroeconomics and brought the concept of economics into the policy realm. I learned a lot about the Central Bank, how the FOMC operates, and how it deals with different financial situations. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the fundamentals of monetary policy and how to write policy papers based on that info. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about monetary policy and some basics about how to build a model. I'd say I gained much more knowledge and insights about monetary policy actually works than skills. ",

            "\u00a0Practical skills development very good. Also incorporating empirical papers was very interesting. Guest lectures were very good. Good mix of problem sets and papers. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was overall well designed. Professor English gave excellent feedback on all the assignments, and was very patient and helpful with questions both in class and office hours. \r\n\r\nI found the papers to be challenging and a bit tedious in addition to the problem sets and the final exam. In the future, given the emphasis of this course on policy writing, I would change the weighting of the grade such that the papers are worth more and the final exam less. It would also be helpful to have one or two strong paper examples from previous years to guide us in our initial pass at the writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a great econ department class. Papers were actually interesting to write, material was interesting in class, and the tabletop exercise was fun. I personally wouldn't have a final exam worth 40% in a writing credit, and lectures could be slightly dry at times, but overall super interesting material and high level of engagement with it through the papers and preparation for the tabletop. Anyone interested in economic policy, the causes of the financial crisis, or how the US recovered, even in the broadest sense, should 100% take this class. ",
            "\u00a0The material is rock solid, but the lectures could perhaps be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to have to give reading responses, right now it's difficult to find the motivation to do the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This class was super interesting, and Professor English is honestly a phenomenal teacher to learn from. The structure of the course, with being a writing credit but having a written final worth 40% of the grade was really frustrating though. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, no obvious weaknesses. Professor and his experience are a huge strength. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor English is clearly very knowledgeable on the subject and lectures are thorough. Cool visiting lectures and discussion of current events/new data. Lots of clear feedback on essays. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can be very dry. Additionally, for such a small class, there is little to no engagement with the students (less than any of my other lectures of 100+). He never stands up from his chair or deviates from the lecture slides  there are rarely opportunities for questions beyond clarification or an opportunity for him to stand up and draw something out on the chalkboard. Overall, it's static. Additionally, there are assigned readings each week, but they never are addressed in lecture. There is no midterm but three essays that felt a little repetitive in topic, and then a final that was difficult to gauge since there was no midterm in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include (1) breadth of material covered, (2) introduction to debates and evolution of the field, (3) mixture of theory and application, (4) focus on understanding and communication, and (5) exposure to practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topic, complex material was made accessible (for the most part), and the professor was excellent. I also liked the diversity of assignments. I thought there was a good mix of p-sets and papers-- the papers were an excellent opportunity to utilize the material we learned in a creative way. Another highlight was the guest speakers that the professor invited; it was fascinating hearing from Paul Tucker, Athanasios Orphanides, and Trish Mosser. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload for the course is extremely demanding, and came at the expense of some of my other classes. I put more time into this course than any other I took this past semester and still felt like it wasn't enough. I don't blame the professor-- I think the workload was reasonable given the demands of the subject. The workload just reflects how complex the subject is. We spent the first couple weeks of the course doing a review of macro and learning the NK model piece by piece. That felt very rushed, and even with a couple p-sets to practice it, I didn't feel as on top of it as I would've liked. Unfortunately we had to move on relatively quickly to get into the bigger monetary theory topics, and even then we ran out of time and didn't get to cover topics like alternative policy frameworks (like price level targeting and NGDP targeting) in much detail. I doubt it is feasible to split into two, but I think this course would've been better served if the macro and underlying NK model material was part of a pre-requisite course, allowing for more time to delve into the monetary policy and fed decision topics. \r\n\r\nThe only other specific change I would recommend in terms of workload is to space out the last couple assignments a little bit better. The 3rd paper, final exam, and paper rewrite was due in the span of about a week, and all three of those required a lot of time to prepare for. Depending on how extensive each student's rewrite is, that can be the equivalent of 3 final exams/papers, which I think is an unrealistic expectation to place on students during finals period in which they also have exams and papers to complete for other classes. Perhaps dropping the rewrite or moving the 3rd paper up would help alleviate the acute pressure. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Very well taught course. ",
            "\u00a0At times, the course felt a bit inaccessible. There is an incredible depth and breadth of material covered, and it was often hard to stay on top of things and follow exactly what was going on. That said, when I did dig into it, the material was interesting and highly relevant. Definitely make an effort to ask Professor English any and all questions you have. I wish I'd done this more, as whenever I did he was very insightful and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 10/10 recommend as an econ elective. Fair warning: I can see how this course would be high-workload and boring if you're not interested in the material, but the way the Fed operates behind the scenes to control the US economy is fascinating (at least to me), so I'm not sure why you wouldn't be interested. Workload can be heavy with the papers and final exam, especially toward the end of the semester, but I was super engaged with the material and feel like I learned maybe the most I've learned in any econ elective so far. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0If said person was interested in central banking absolutely. If otherwise, absolutely not. ",
            "\u00a0If you're actually interested in monetary policy, yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is honestly one of those classes at Yale that you HAVE to brag about when you think about the opportunities this school can provide. Professor English is a genius, and the content of the class, guest lecturers, and even mock-FOMC meeting that takes place in the class really allow a deeper engagement with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a hidden gem of the econ department. Although the three papers (5 pages each) require a substantial amount of thought and analytic work, the length makes them very manageable. Bill's experience from 25 years at the board shines through in lectures when he talks about the Committee's thought process in detail. Overall, would recommend to anyone who wants to have a framework to understand monetary policy at the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but the initial model development is a heavy lift. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course should be required for anyone interested in macroeconomics, since monetary policy has such an important impact on the macro environment. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Professor English is great "
