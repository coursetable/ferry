            "\u00a0I learned how to approach character work through answering/grappling with the five questions. I learned and will continue to work through bringing my self into a role. I think the most invaluable insight I had from this class was on how to make a scene/moment active and getting out of the self in bringing a life stage. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Wallace is very committed to students and their growth. \r\nWeakness: I wonder if there's a way for a better way to do outside rehearsals. Two actors rehearsing without a director presents a challenge especially if one tries to direct the other. It's also a challenge for young actors who may not know what to do get to where they want to go. A suggestion would be to maybe have a TA that checks in with groups every once in a while/sits on one or two rehearsals during the semester?\r\n\r\nAlso because of the workshopping nature of the class there might be an inbalance in which groups get more time to work each week ",
            "\u00a0Greg is a very smart and encouraging acting coach\r\nweakly defined class/independent rehearsal structure--scenework was pretty nebulous and I didn't have a sense of the general trajectory of the class (if there was one) "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in acting and you're interested in challenging yourself, absolutely take a class with Gregory Wallace! I really enjoyed this class. That said, if acting isn't a huge priority of yours, I would recommend taking it Cr/D/F to take the pressure off. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a really challenging course with a fantastic professor that will push your acting to the next level, TAKE THIS CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to someone. I know it's 8:25a, but it's so worth it and not as hard to commit to as you may think. As an actor who has had very little training this class has taught me so much & has given me tools to approach any role in the future. I would highly highly recommend!! It's definitely the best acting class I've taken at Yale so far. Also Professor Wallace gives very detailed feedback & is able to pinpoint probelm areas very easily. I've grown so much from this class and can't imagine having not taken it. ",
            "\u00a0not necessarily. If you really want a crash course in chekhov's works or to get to know an interesting professor then it's useful, but as an acting class it's a bit like any other "
