            "\u00a0EALL 289 was at once thoroughly engaging and interesting. The literature that we read and films that we watched in the class provided a wonderful mixture of content not only to keep discussion lively but also to provide different angles from which to view the material.  Overall, I gained a pivotal lens through which to view film and to close read literature. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt to analyze the genre of crime fiction across different eras and East Asian countries ",
            "\u00a0Not only was I able to develop analysis skills that helped my analyze and understand works through the lens of East Asian crime fiction, I was also able to develop my understanding of genre in general to apply those skills to other works. I have also come to better understand the connections between East Asian history and the crime and detective fiction works that came out of East Asia throughout the years and how those works can be looked at the better understand the situation at the time. Overall, I developed a better appreciation for East Asian crime fiction. "

            "\u00a0Our prof could have been more active in leading discussions. Oftentimes it felt like we would go over points people wanted to bring up but not really flesh out these points. Would be better if prof had some topics in mind to hold a deeper discussion about ",
            "\u00a0Interesting texts and films! The content is all very fascinating. However, I disliked the structure of the class as it relied heavily on student participation/discussion, which often turned out lackluster (when people don't do their readings etc).\r\n\r\nThe midterm assignment of writing your own crime fiction short story was very fun though. I wish we could have a chance to peer review one another's stories. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very well organized as it took the class through various time periods and countries. We were always provided context to the works that we were reading, but at times it was in innovative ways (such as having us extrapolate from the work before learning about the actual context) that lead us to use our the understanding of genre that we had developed up until that point.\r\nWe were also constantly engaged in the material due the weekly reading responses as well as the lively discussions that brought the whole class together. In general the laid back atmosphere combined with the passion that Professor Poland brought to the class allowed everyone to be truly engaged and interested in the material without feeling a pressure to work purely for a grade.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend. This is a great class to learn about genre theory and read/watch East Asian crime fiction books and films. ",
            "\u00a0EALL 289 was at once thoroughly engaging and interesting.

I would highly recommend the course to someone especially if they are interested in an EALL class that is a little out of the ordinary, yet still incredibly fun, informative, and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with some tweaks to the syllabus and course structure. And yes if there are more students in the class with better engagement and participation. "
