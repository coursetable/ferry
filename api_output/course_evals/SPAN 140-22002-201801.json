            "\u00a0I became a much more fluent Spanish speaker, a far better writer, and I also now have much better comprehension skills, both when reading Spanish literature and listening to others speak. I also learned a great deal about Latin American culture and history, particularly those of Mexico. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish 140 definitely helped me to improve my writing and speaking ability. Take it with Professor Cividanes if you can, because she makes it so much more interesting and fun! ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing and speaking abilities in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking ability has improved tremendously and I feel comfortable using a variety of verb tenses. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more comfortable with speaking and writing and the grammar concepts as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my comprehension of Spanish. My confidence with the Spanish language improved greatly and I grew more comfortable interacting with the language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new grammar techniques that I had not previously been exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good deal of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. I also believe I learned a lot of the nuances of the Spanish language, which theoretically would make me a better speaker, writer, and reader in the language. I also learned a small amount about Spanish culture (although more about the culture of Spain than of Latin America), and a fair amount of Spanish literature. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing, speaking, and reading abilities in Spanish throughout this course and I now feel that I am a much more fluent Spanish speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Learning to write, read, and speak the Spanish language at a high level. ",
            "\u00a0I developed much better listening skills. I learned much of the more complicated grammar involved in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that my Spanish reading and writing skills were improved by this course, and that my speaking skills were improved most of all. I especially enjoyed reading, reflecting on, and writing about various stories and articles that we read in class. "

            "\u00a0This course is honestly the perfect language course. Before it, I was not at all a confident Spanish speaker, but now, I can comfortably carry out a conversation or even speak publicly in Spanish. This course does a great job of balancing speaking, reading, and writing to improve and test all areas of language learning. One thing I disliked about this course was using VHL. It was very confusing, and the grammar prompts were often unclear. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it really does help your fluency (both culturally and orally), since it meets everyday. I think the main weakness would be that sometimes the homework seems like busy work and isn't that didactic. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion based style of class was very strong. I felt that I developed my speaking abilities quite thoroughly. \r\n\r\nI think the online supersite homework could use some improvement. At times the work felt tedious and unengaging. I found assignments within the CC to be more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Supersite often is unclear and unfair in its grading. ",
            "\u00a0There is very little focus on culture. I also think the \"homework\" and \"preparation for class\" columns in the syllabus in the course manual should be combined into one column. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the readings - they are interesting to read and engaging. The weakness is how the class participation is graded. Because participation is largely based on grammatical correctness, it discouraged me personally from saying much of anything in class because I felt I would be judged. This made it so I didn't practice very much in front of the class because I was scared of being penalized (because I have relatively good fluency but bad grammar). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its focus on constant use of Spanish, and the fact that it meets everyday to further promote the use of Spanish. The class also offers a great deal of practice so that students who want to learn more have plenty of opportunities to do so. The main weakness of this class are it overly emphasizes perfectly correct grammar and discourages pure conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I enjoyed this course, however, it could get bland at times when we were working on grammar and vocabulary. I did enjoy the movies we watched (especially \"No\") as well as the novel we read at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong development of comprehension and speaking.  Very minimal weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of being engaging and interesting because we get to talk with peers in the class and learn from them as well as from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The class effectively combines grammar and vocabulary instruction with exposure to literature and opportunities to speak both formally and casually. ",
            "\u00a0Final exam was a bit excessive with the vocabulary. Had to know all of the grammar, plus the movies, plus the readings. Seemed unnecessary to have to memorize the vocab from the textbook, readings, and movies for the final exam. "

            "\u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student. Spanish L4 is wonderful because you are finally more or less done learning grammar, and now you get the chance to really apply and synthesize your learning to become a true Spanish speaker and writer. It is also a great course in that the materials are fascinating. We watched a fantastic movie, read a good book, and we also had many other interesting short stories, articles, and video clips to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Spanish 140 is a wonderfully taught, engaging class. You learn strong grammatical and speaking skills and explore a lot of interesting texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes--I took it to fulfill the language requirement but it definitely gave me a greater appreciation for the Spanish language and if I wasn't so bad at Spanish I would probably continue taking courses in it. We watch interesting movies and have good in-class discussions, in addition to improving our abilities in the more technical aspects of the language (learning grammar, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0It depends on the person. I don't know that I would with my personal experience, however if something is really interested in Spanish and has the time to put in to really focus on the class I would - because it is a class set up that if you do that you should succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I would likely not recommend this course to another student. If a student truly wanted to learn how to speak and understand Spanish more confidently, then Span140 likely would not be their best course of action. Admittedly they would learn a fairly good amount of grammar and vocab, but I assert that this is \"missing the forest for the trees.\" Indeed there is a good chance that the student will speak less confidently because their Spanish is not grammatically perfect, even if it is perfectly intelligible. I recognize the need for learning grammar and being precise in your communication, but I think that most Spanish learners at this level are not ready for that level of rigor - they would be better being encouraged to speak than put down for slight imperfections. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that wished to improve their Spanish speaking abilities. However, if you are looking for a gut language class, this would not be it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it if you want to learn spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I felt that this class helped me approach fluency in Spanish, while also providing me opportunities to study the culture, literature, politics, history, etc. of the Spanish-speaking world. ",
            "\u00a0No. In my opinion, Ame Cividanes failed to cultivate an attitude of enthusiasm and RESPECT for Latin American culture. "
