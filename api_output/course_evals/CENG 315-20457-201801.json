            "\u00a0Strengths:  Small/close-knit class size, comprehensive lecturer style, good online notes for review/study, kind/understanding professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Very mathematically dense, easy to fall behind if not studying ~12-15 hours/week.  A huge difference from previous engineering classes, as you also go into mathematical proofs at the beginning, then go beyond differential equations into tensor calculus, perturbation methods, and other stuff.\r\n\r\nDo not take if you haven't taken differential equations!!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is the professor. He doesn't listen to the students when they tell him his teaching style is not working, and then we all tank the midterm. He gave us sets that he expected us to spend more than 10 hours a week on. Do you think this is the only class I'm taking?? The only reason we got through was because of Rodrigo, the TA. Professor Amir taught this class as if he were teaching grad students, and our TA agreed with that, since he had taken the exact same course with Amir previously. Please bring back Loewenberg. Then I'd actually learn something. ",
            "\u00a0THIS COURSE IS TOO HARD. WE ARE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. We do not need to be using a grad-level text and receiving problem sets that even the TA cannot complete at times. Amir seems like a nice guy but he just does not seem to understand that this course was completely ruined by the sheer difficulty that he required us to learn it at. I got nothing from this course because it is way above the abilities of the average undergrad chemical engineering major, even at YALE. This course needs to be completely restructured, there is no way to salvage it through adjustments. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall much too difficult- I would have gotten more out of it had it been easier. The problem sets were much too long and difficult and took many, many  hours. ",
            "\u00a0The course revolved too much around mathematics and not enough around chemical engineering. I don't feel now as if I can tackle any more chemE problems, but I do feel like I can take on the world (because nothing we do outside of Yale will ever be as confusingly difficult as transport, I'm sure of it). ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the questions initially seemed very difficult, sometimes based on the wording. Also, I think more in class examples would've been helpful for actually grasping concepts, because sometimes the derivations became overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Haji has very organized notes and the TA was so so amazing in helping us do the psets. I wouldn't have known how to do them if it wasn't for the TA. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by providing homework assignments that are at a more appropriate difficulty level given what is taught in lecture. There often seemed to be a disconnect between in-class lectures and the homework assignments. Lectures briefly covered an overview of each topic with examples scattered throughout and then the homework assignments were so difficult that nearly everyone in the class had trouble even starting them. I think students would get more out of this class if there was a greater connection between what is taught in lecture and what is assigned in the homework, and the difficulty level of the homework assignments should also be reassessed. I believe the homeworks assigned were closer to graduate level assignments rather than undergraduate. ",
            "\u00a0The course material itself is very challenging-there is a constant emphasis on the rigorous application of differential equations. It is however quite interesting and an enjoyable challenge. The workload did vary dramatically based on the problem sets, though; some took 3 hours, while some easily required 10+ hours. The greatest issue was that some of the problems simply could not have been solved without the TF guiding us through them step-by-step. ",
            "\u00a0The class was way too fast.  Most people do not have the math background that the professor thinks we do.  He is not very open to feedback and just kept going, leaving many people behind.  This is evidence from the huge range of scores on the tests.  The psets were unbelievably lengthy. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course could be interesting, but Prof Amir was not a good teacher. We all hated every minute of lecture. We tried and were so lost. Coming to lecture was insulting. Amir would say in lecture and in notes \"it is easy to show that\" or \"obviously, this is the answer\". And none of us knew why. This is a grad student course taught to undergrads without changing it. Our TA took the course last semester and had the same psets and similar exams. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized, the TA Rodrigo was incredible, and Professor Haji, taught us a lot but the problem with this class is that it was just far too challenging. this was a graduate level course being taught to undergrads and  feel that I just was not able to get a full grasp on the material.

            "\u00a0Only take this course if you already have completed the classes for Physical chemistry I, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics.  The math is time-consuming to understand, and only take if adequately prepared (as an engineering, applied math, physics major, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe need for a solid background in math cannot be over-emphasized! ",

            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!!!! If you have to take it, I am very sorry :( You will likely not get anything out of the course because the level that Amir insists on teaching it necessitates already knowing linear algebra and matrix operations in addition to coordinate transformations beyond the scope of multivariable calculus. Perhaps he thinks we should be taking linear algebra as an elective on top of the 28 course requirements for ABET chem e??? I was so unhappy this entire semester-- the problem sets take 6 to 10 hours AFTER attending a 3 hour section where the TA goes through each problem step by step. Why? BECAUSE IT IS TOO HARD AND ABOVE THE LEVEL OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS! ",

            "\u00a0If you're a chemical engineering major, you have no choice. Sorry. This class will ruin your semester. The sections will often last over 3 hours. The psets are impossible. Your one saving grace will be if Rodrigo Reboucas is your TA. If you're an environmental engineering major or some other engineering major, avoid it at at all costs. ",

If you are taking it with Professor Haji, sometimes you won't understand what's going on in class, but make sure to go to every Recitation to get help on the homework and read through the notes he posts online. AND DO THE HOMEWORK. ",

Think 15 hours every week on problem sets.  There is a problem set every week, and the class moves extremely quickly.  If you get behind you are done.  Just prepare for unreasonable amounts of work, including a 20 hour pset during reading week.  Superbly difficult and time consuming class, and you will have no idea why you are completing any of it. ",
            "\u00a0Never take it unless required. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course you likely do not have a choice. If you are not required to take this course stay very far away from it, and if you are, I recommend taking it with a lighter workload if you would like to truly understand the material. "
