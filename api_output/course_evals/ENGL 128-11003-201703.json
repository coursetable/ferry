            "\u00a0Knowledge and insight are perhaps not the best words to describe what one gains from taking ENGL 128, as most of us left the course with more questions than answers. The ability to question not only the texts we read but also the way in which we are reading and discussing them could be described as a skill, but might more appropriately be labeled an attitude. Skepticism is the closest word I can think of to describe that attitude, but I again emphasize that this skepticism is not directed solely at the curriculum but at ourselves as readers, as Yale students, as Westerners, as people who may or may not have considered the implications of a \"canon\" before taking this course, as writers, as cultural outsiders and insiders, and as critics. \r\n\r\nThis course made me rethinkand ultimately reaffirmmy decision to be an English major, not because I obtained some universalizing revelation about English literature(s), but because this course forced me to realize that such a revelation is unattainable in the first place. If I gained anything truly worthy of the label \"insight\" from this class, it is the understanding that literature is not as static is it can often be portrayed in the other three fundamental English major courses. It is a rich and dynamic field suffused with political messages, cultural commentaries, and often quite a bit of arrogance. Teasing out these themes, discussing them in seminar, and examining them at length in papers have all been enlightening, infuriating, puzzling, saddening, and enriching all at once. \r\n\r\nWe were taught an entirely new (to me) mode of reading, one which demanded us to consider what was left unsaid, and why it was omitted. We were encouraged to doubt the narrator, doubt the editor, doubt the critics, doubt the professor, doubt the institution, and doubt ourselves in our own readings of the curriculum. This is perhaps the greatest gift of the course: feeling empowered enough to interrogate our own interpretations of the material, to understand that no one has all (if any) of the answers, and to keep trying anyways. ",
            "\u00a0Steph was an amazing professor and she taught me so much about how to read literature. Steph is really into context of works of literature--so she taught me how to investigate the backgrounds of the authors and the works we read. I also learned SO MUCH about how to write a paper from her--especially how to write a paper using literary criticism and secondary sources, which is something I hadn't learned before. ",
            "\u00a0This class was absolutely life-changing. I recommend everyone who is interested in excellent English literature, feminist and gender issues, sexuality issues and the way 'others' are viewed by the tradition of English canon. It was a total revoultionization of my thought process and understanding of literature. 50 years from now, when I would be recollecting formative experiences from my life, this class and every seminar of it would mark a significant point. Take this with Steph if you can, she's a genius and so, so kind. ",
            "\u00a0My outlook on literature was completely changed by this course. I learned to look for discomfort rather than certainty, questions rather than answers, and fragmentation rather than continuity; I couldn't be happier about the transformation of my view. The question of what exactly \"English Literature\" is (-- englishes literatures?--) and where we place the \"canon\" was a foundation upon which the course was built, which definitely deconstructed some things I had learned in other classes :) \r\n\r\nThe works themselves teach so much, and every week the homework I looked forward to most was my 128 reading. Having some literary theory and secondary sourcing on top of them made the experience that much more fruitfulthis is not something you'll find in all English courses, and it is great (if slightly more work).\r\n\r\nMy writing improved so much, especially with the inclusion of secondary sourcing and theory in it. ",
            "\u00a0This class was crucial to my development as learning experience as an English major. The skills and insights we gained from this class ranges from textual analysis to political analysis about the politics of translation. I learned so much history in addition to the literature that enriched my experience. I gained the ability to critically think about the text I'm reading and how it is influenced by language and translation. I learned how imperialism and colonialism is inherently tied to the literary world and how it shapes what we value. ",
            "\u00a0English 128 is a unique survey of Anglophone literature . The course offers an entertaining and edifying mix of genres, authors, and subject matter. Furthermore, it is a course that emphasizes a synthetic mode of thinking that allows you to discuss the texts in conversation with theory and literary criticisms for essay assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about how to analyze a text and incorporate critic's theories into the way I viewed the text. I also improved on my essay formatting and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to expand my understandings of English literature beyond close-readings/single text analyses, as well as beyond the conventional canon. I learned how to write an English paper that engaged with a work politically and usually with additional sources, sometimes those not often applied to literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave foundational insight into why and how we should study English literature(s), and what English literature really is. Importantly, it did so in a cautious, self-aware way, which encouraged us to acknowledge that some things are not understandable, noticeable, or translatable, by virtue of who you are as a reader. This is a lesson that many Yale students could benefit to learn, especially those who are interested in studying, learning about, or traveling to other parts of the world. In terms of more specific skills, I learned a lot about persuasive writing and use of secondary sources in literary analysis, which I did not learn in other foundational English courses. ",
            "\u00a0I don't even know where to begin. This class was the best class I've taken at Yale College as an English major.\r\n\r\nBefore this course, I had never taken an introductory course that encouraged such careful thought about the political context of each work, and how each author was positioning themself to the reader.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to write because the answer is so enormous. It gave me a more critical eye and more efficient vocabulary w/ which to express my ideas. Just an amazing, amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0How to write an academic paper, postcolonial literature, how to read, how to think. ",
            "\u00a0This course has definitely developed my reading and analytical skills, particularly in relation to situating a text within certain concepts and theoretical frameworks. The pace of the course challenged my reading skills and the papers, with their broad focus, encouraged me to research deeper into this perhaps unexplored world of world english literatures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to consider a text in its entire context, how to find and synthesize secondary sources to augment my argument, and gained exposure to texts from diverse geographical areas to which I had not previously been exposed. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of literature I would have otherwise not had access to at Yale, and was able to participate in truly interesting, exciting, and provocative class discussions based off that literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze literature from a political standpoint and within its literary context. I learned how to implement and benefit from supplementary readings to better read and understand a text within its given context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various theories of literature while researching my papers, particularly those surrounding postcolonial theory and worlding in world literature. I learned about feminist theory and subtle resistance from my classmates. I learned about naturalism, reading with humility, and critiques of Eurocentric feminist theory. I started to become more comfortable with argumentative literary criticism and looked at other theories and criticism surrounding my paper topic. "

            "\u00a0ENGL 128 is wonderfully flawed course. It is wonderful in that its flaws reveal exactly why it needs to exist, and why it is a meaningful and fairly successful first step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nTo list several potential improvements:\r\n\r\n- Include more women and queer authors. In a course which is marketed as speaking back to a lack of representation among authorship in the English program at Yale, three of the eleven books on the curriculum should not be written by white Irishmen. \r\n\r\n- When deciding which women to include on the syllabus, consider the sorts of works being included. One of the books already included that was written by a woman, The History of Mary Prince, stimulated discussion precisely because it was filtered through the lens of a white male narrator. Another woman-authored book, Wide Sargasso Sea, explicitly writes back to Jane Eyre, a traditionally canonical English book. Only one of the woman-authored novels, Lives of Girls and Women (which should absolutely remain on the syllabus) largely manages to escape a damaging discourse. This course was fairly successful at avoiding a \"writing back\" structure, except on this particular (and noticeably gendered) front.\r\n\r\n- State explicitly at the beginning of the class that the typical seminar atmosphere is not ideal for this type of course. By this I do not mean that a spirit of free discussion and mutual respect are incompatible with conversations on traditionally non-canonical literature, but rather that seminars at Yale tend to devolve into performative displays of academic bickering that do not embody the \"humility\" which Achebe encourages Western critics to adopt when approaching African literature (and which we would do well to bring to all Anglophone literatures).\r\n\r\n- Cap the class at 18. We had a few too many students in our seminar to allow everyone to express their thoughts to the fullest extent they desired, and a smaller class would have been preferable, in hindsight.\r\n\r\nTo highlight the course's achievements:\r\n\r\n- Preserve the spirit of self-reflective skepticism. Many of our class's most riveting discussions focused on issues of readership and whether we, as Yale students, were justified in \"dipping\" (to use a classmate's term) into a culture each week without much context, and then proceeding to critique a book or play that arose from that culture. \r\n\r\n- The workload is ideal in terms of reading and writing papers, but maybe having the longest work (Midnight's Children) assigned at the end of the semester was stressful for students with finals and other obligations that week.\r\n\r\n- Keep encouraging the use of secondary materials. Valuable context can arise from the use of outside sources, context that we would never have been able to obtain by the close reading techniques taught in courses such as ENGL 125.\r\n\r\n- Keep allowing students to decide their own topics for papers. I felt more invested in the outcome of my research and noticed a considerable increase in the quality of my work as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was not as great as I wanted it to be. We read more white Irish men than we did women authors, and the only LGBTQ+ authors we read were an outside resource that Steph brought in. I think that this is a major weakness of the course as there are plenty of great LGBTQ+ and women authors to include, and not having them on the syllabus sends not so great messages about their place in World English Literatures. ",
            "\u00a0It would be cool to have even more women writers, along with POC and Queer POC writers from all over the world. I loved studying every reading that we had assigned but I wonder if we could cut down on one or two Irish dudes for some other people. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the course was a strength. I looked forward to reading the works on the syllabus more than any other homework I did this semester. The inclusion of it in the English curriculum is absolutely crucial. Steph was incredible, and made the seminar so engaging. The inclusion of secondary sourcing and theory was essential, and improved my writing greatly. The focus on discomfort and exclusion vs. inclusion in literature was powerful.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was the size of the seminar. I love that Steph tried to include everyone, but 20 people in a seminar is just too many. It became more performative than it should have been. Also, there were too few women and too many Irishmen on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a very strong syllabus with great texts to spark great discussion every single seminar. The strengths lie in Professor Newell's management of the class and her discussion starters. This class was imperative for so many to break the rigid routine of what we normally engage with in the English department. \r\nI would like to see more female authors on the syllabus to give more complexity to the issue and better fulfill the course's intent. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class, and I'm very excited that it's now one of the core intro classes in the English major. I'm excited by the fact that this course exists, and by the fact that you can take it instead of reading Chaucer. \r\n\r\nIf it's an effort to \"diversify the curriculum\" -- which it should be -- then it should go much farther. Why were there so many texts by white men? I can think of at least four (Joyce, Synge, Friel, Coetzee, maybe another?). I think there were only three women (Munro, Mary Prince, Rhys). In my opinion, there should be no white writers on this syllabus, and a decent sampling of female authors. The curriculum now seems like a decent start, but it feels pretty conservative to me. \r\n\r\nI like that this class, unlike all the intro classes, (at least as taught by Steph), focuses on a more macro political reading rather than close reading. That was exciting. I wish it had been an option when I was a first year. \r\n\r\nIn terms of taking the class with Steph, she works really hard and she really cares. But her classroom can feel frustrating and competitive. I know that some other great profs like Jill Richards are also teaching 128 in future semesters and I would definitely shop around -- some people love Steph, but I think there are a number of ways in which you might not jive with her. ",
            "\u00a0Fall 2017 marked the course's inception. Due to only one section being open for the semester, the size of the seminar room was unideal. Regardless, my overall experience was a positive and stimulating one. Conversations were rich and endless, resulting in multiple readings of our texts that allowed for comprehensive understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. The texts were interesting and the discussions were awesome. There should be more sections, though, so the class-size can be smaller. The one issue was that there were too many people for the discussion to really delve into the material to extent the class wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an absolutely wonderful and essential addition to the English major. \r\n\r\nI think the class could benefit from more political theory and literary criticism on the syllabus, rather than just the texts we read with an encouragement to find others. \r\n\r\nThis course does a great job of examining texts in different ways, but I would suggest a reworking of the syllabus. Maybe instead of presenting the texts chronologically, they could be organized in a different way to facilitate a path of learning and analysis. For example, because Robinson Crusoe was our first novel of the class, our examination of the text was close and familiar. Later in the semester, as more of us became comfortable with analyzing and problematizing works with outside sources or ideas, I would have appreciated a reexamination of Robinson Crusoe. I don't know if we should even continue to read that book, but if we do, I think we must have the proper analytical and theoretical tools to attack it and challenge its faults as one of the first novels of the English canon. ",
            "\u00a0An obvious strength of this course was its professor, Steph Newell, who led incredibly lively discussions, provided very useful feedback on papers, and always challenged the class to tie new ideas that came up to the broader themes of the course. One thing that I really appreciated about her is she would often make a certain point in class, and then return to that point in the next class and say how she had been thinking differently about it. To me, this showed that she prioritized accuracy and precision, and was willing to change her mind about things, which encouraged the rest of the class to do the same.  She was clearly very engaged with the subject, and gave a sense of urgency and importance to the topics we discussed.\r\n\r\nA weakness, which our class repeatedly returned to, was the reading selection for the course. There is certainly room for more writers of color, and writers from a more diverse range of places around the world, but the biggest, most concrete problem for our class discussions was the lack of women writers. It was difficult, and felt quite wrong to me, to celebrate texts that repeatedly portrayed women in ways that certainly do not capture what its like to be a woman in todays world(s). This can and should be solved by putting more woman writers on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED how Steph explained why each text was on the syllabus. I LOVED class discussions -- there was almost always at least three hands up. I LOVED the books (not that I enjoyed reading everything -- I read the Rushdie with gritted teeth -- more that I always gained something from it). Steph is the STRENGTH of this class. Steph is wonderful, and she has my heart. One of the very best professors I've had.\r\n\r\nWe talked about this in class, but I think that the syllabus should incorporate more female authors. Outside of the mostly oral short stories, we only read Munro and Rhys (unless I'm forgetting someone). We talked a lot about the genders of Munro and Rhys in a way we didn't talk about it w/ Rushdie or Joyce. (I think that in general, the class was anxious to throw on expectations of what a feminist/female/African/Indian/postcolonial text should look like, but we also talked about that in class)\r\n\r\nI think the only weakness I can really point to is some parts of the syllabus (for example: I think the Joyce was kind of pointless? I felt like we were artificially making room for it, and the only thing I got from class discussion that day was \"Wow! Sexism Exists\" whereas with the Coetzee and Rushdie we got to explore whether subalterns could be intentional, what being an African writer meant, what Rushdie's setting gave to the piece etc etc etc.)\r\n\r\nI also think that we really really lucked out with the class composition -- there was SO much class participation. I kind of wish that Steph would have loosened the restraints on who is able to talk next, though. If it were organized as more of a conversation instead of a list of people who raised their hand sometimes fifteen or more minutes ago, I think class might have been more stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Steph is the best professor in the world. She is so engaging, open, friendly, and helpful to students. She created an awesome classroom environment. The course material is challenging, and we were often pushing the boundaries, but I was thoroughly engaged for every single seminar for the whole 1:15, which is usually impossible. I loved writing all 5 of the essays, I loved reading all of the books, and I loved the classroom discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: A *bit* more diversity in the literature would be great, although I think that this in itself is a really diverse canon. I also think if we had out of class reading sessions or something, that could be fun but that's more of a student-led thing. ",
            "\u00a0At first the workload is quite heavy, with one text a week and sometimes secondary readings as well. Particularly when a paper was due, the workload was quite demanding, especially if you chose to include secondary materials in your paper. \r\nThe prompts of the papers were very flexible, which greatly encouraged students to make the most of this course by taking their research in whatever direction most interested them. \r\nThe texts were all interesting reads but there should be more female writers included in the course and perhaps more background theory, for example on the meaning of \"postcolonial\", as well as historical/political contexts for each of the writers. \r\nThe faculty might consider including some texts from South Africa, such as Nadine Gordimer. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its exploration of the entirety of a text (from its social and political contexts to how the text is packaged and marketed), its readings from around the globe, and its move away from close reading to broader literary analysis. I would say the course had two minor weaknesses. First, class discussions sometimes devolved into ideological and theoretical debates from which I felt excluded. Second, there were too many texts by Irish authors in the reading list. I think there were at least 3 Irish texts, far more than any other geographical area. I enjoyed Joyce and Synge, but \"Translations\" by Brian Friel was a disappointing text that could be replaced by a text from another part of the Anglophone world to further diversify the reading. For example, we didn't read anything by an author from Australia, New Zealand, or Oceania. A text  from this part of the world would make a great addition to the reading list. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the professor and the novels. The only weakness was the lack of time to truly dive into each work.  I would have liked more time to explore some of the texts that we read. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed to educate students about literature written in the English language throughout the world in different diverse communities. I thought that the texts we read were extremely rich, but I would argue that in a class that advertises itself as diverse, the course should offer more texts written by female authors. I think \"Translations\" should be removed from the curriculum. I was confused about some essay prompts and found them a bit too vague. ",
            "\u00a0I felt so engaged with classroom discussion, and that is in part due to the commitment of my classmates, who continuously chimed in with their thoughts. Sometimes we had a brief debate between two people, other times classmates would offer to defer their comment so that someone else could speak about an interesting topic. I was very aware of how we were the first class for the new English major, and definitely felt very proud and glad to be in this class. That being said, there was so much interest for this class, and it was rather large for a seminar, and I wish more students had a chance to speak and hear each other overall. Perhaps students could write up a reflection and post it to a discussion thread on Canvas prior to each week (half on Tuesday, half on Thursday, or something like that)! And one crucial thing that wouldve helped me is an introduction (early on in the course) to the theories surrounding world literature, what it is, and the rapidly evolving field! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Simply put, this class can be seen as a stress test for any Yale student, but especially English majors. To invest our lives in the discussion and/or production of works in English means that we must be prepared to answer (or at least, attempt to answer) difficult questions about readership, critique, theory, canon, and narrative control. ENGL 128 is the first course I have ever taken at Yale that forced me to ask myself those questions. Discussions in class were never dull, and self-assigned papers let you delve as deeply into any topic as you would like, whether or not it was discussed in class. If you're on the fence about the course, go to the first class and see what you think. You'll know if you want to be in it within the first thirty minutes of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Steph is amazing and gives such great comments on papers and in class. Her breadth of knowledge is amazing! The literature you read will be different from most other English classes, and you will really get to learn about different viewpoints. There is more reading than most other introductory courses--we read a book a week. But I really enjoyed our class discussions about all of them. Also, Steph is great about teaching us how to utilize literary criticism in our papers as opposed to just close readings, which is so great to have. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, a 1000 times yes. Please take this class if you're a human being who's interested in how perceptions and truths about people are told to us. I will not be the same person after having taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! If you are an English major, PLEASE take it for the requirement. If you aren't, STILL take it because it will change your view of literature. The syllabus was more engaging than one of any other class I have taken. Steph was phenomenaltake it with her if you can. This class will push you to deconstruct canons and English Literature in general (is it --englishes literatures?--) and look for discomfort rather than safety in literature.\r\n\r\nThe work is sizable: one book a week of between 150-300 pages, and 4 papers of 5-7/8 pages throughout the semester. No tests or finals. It is SO worth it, though. Your writing will improve, and your experience of reading literature will challenged and expanded. ",
            "\u00a0I would and already have recommended this class to students of various different majors. It was the best course I took this semester and one of the best ones I've taken at Yale. I'd recommend this because I think the political discussions about the literature demonstrate the applicability of literature of language to things outside of an academic context and the questions we are faced with are imperative for a college student to think about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes if you're an English major absolutely yes, it's a great addition to those intro courses. \r\n\r\nBut I would qualify: The workload is fairly high -- in that there's a lot of reading, a novel a week -- but at the same time, the class feels very intro-y. There were a number of first years in their first semester in my section, and mostly sophomores, and since it was these under-termers in the English major, I felt like many of them were encountering these political modes of reading/ reading theory for the first time, which can be frustrating at times if you feel like you have a solid background in theory. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend English 128 to be taken over as one of the three prerequisite courses in preparation for the major; it is a refreshing syllabus that won't have you reiterating the same texts you encountered in high school. I also recommend English 128 for non-majors; it is a solid introductory WR course that does not emphasize close-reading nor require a lot of background in literary analysis or theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a fantastic course and the teacher Stephanie Newell is awesome. I would especially recommend if you are interested in stepping away from English curricula filled with dead white male authors. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! This is the best course I've taken at Yale. It challenges you in an unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable way, but it's incredibly important. I've grown more as a writer, reader, and human thanks to this class. We read works not found on many other English syllabi -- but this does not mean they are unworthy of our study and attention, rather, it demonstrates that this department needs more reassessment and more classes like English 128. We don't do much close reading, which sets this class apart from the other introductory courses. Instead, we look outward to the ramifications of literature and use political and critical theory to analyze texts. Steph is absolutely incredible -- so thoughtful, so kind, so brilliant. Getting to know and laugh with her throughout the semester was such a joy, and she taught all of us so much. Take this class!! At least shop it. It's amazing. I was initially on the fence, but I'm so so glad I decided to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you plan to study English literature, and especially if you can take it with Steph! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that everyone should take this course whether or not you're an English major. The workload is kind of easy, about a short book or so a week, with larger texts positioned after breaks. It just encourages a kind of thinking about a text that is critical and political that I think would lend itself to:\r\n1. Interesting and Cool party conversation\r\n2. a richer way of experiencing all literature ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 10000x yes. This is the best course I have ever taken at Yale hands down and I am a STEM major. World Literature will literally change your life. I have never thought so deeply about the topics presented in the course, or taken so much time to write a paper, because I was grappling with the ideas for so long. Steph is an amazing professor - she is always open to chat, flexible with deadlines, understanding, supportive, and creates a great classroom environment. Everyone is encouraged to speak up in class, no one ever feels \"dumber\" than anyone else, and Steph brought in outside material that is challenging, but made it approachable. \r\n\r\nThis course is, at times, difficult because we discuss many different cultures from our Western perspective. Steph made everyone aware of that, brought it to the surface, and really made the course so powerful and meaningful for everyone. This was the first class where I was encouraged, and felt so passionate about speaking up in the class. We didn't analyze the literature with a close reading. It was about the ideas, the themes, and how they relate to life. Coming to this class twice a week was one of my favorite points of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The texts are fascinating to read and the class discussions we had really stretched my understanding of \"english literature\". I finally had the opportunity to read writers beyond the traditional canon and the format of the paper assignments meant that I could take whatever texts or concepts most interested me and investigate it further. It was a really intellectually stimulating but also freeing course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Its approach to literary analysis is far different from most other English classes, and the exposure you gain to texts from other parts of the world is indispensable. There was a lot of reading, but it changed the way I think about literature, so it was a fair trade-off. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. ENGL 128 with Steph Newell is hands down the best class I have taken at Yale. Take this course for the incredible books you will read and the fascinating seminar discussions you will have and also take this class because Steph is one of the best professors that Yale has to offer. Don't worry if you are not an English major, you can still do well in this course! The material that this course centers on is so so so important that you can't risk not taking this class and--regardless of whether you are planning on going into finance, consulting, to medical school, etc.--never reading Edward Said's Orientalism, Alice Munro's The Lives of Girls and Women, or Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. It is certain that you will learn more in this HU credit about the world than in any other course, because the fiction that you read in this course is more true to reality than most other things you will encounter at Yale--Rushdie would agree! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend this course to all Yale students.  It is a great way to explore literature that moves past the Canon. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student with Professor Stephanie Newell. She was extremely warm and engaging and I looked forward to every class meeting. I would recommend this class to any student considering the English major. ",
            "\u00a0Take World Lit!!!!!! The texts and theories are so engaging, and whats more, they stretch across many centuries, so its fascinating to explore the texts as world literature. Professor Newell (aka Steph!) leads such breathtaking and eye-opening discussions--I always left class wishing I couldve stayed longer!!! Its a really special foundational English course because it brings in the context and theory pertaining to the reading. I learned so much doing independent research on the texts, but I also received such crucial guidance from Steph!!! I loved being able to talk about these texts with my classmates, and I really treasure what theyve said in class. When I look back at what Ive written down I remember the heated debates (lol), the attempts to resolve each others critiques, and a lot of friendship in between :) "
