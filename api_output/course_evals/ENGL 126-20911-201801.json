            "\u00a0So much. This class is awesome. Professor Hammer is incredibly knowledgeable and he makes it seem as if every comment is worth listening to. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about the text of poetry in relation to its form, and I learned how to discuss these works in essays and craft an argument around them. ",
            "\u00a0I gained practice analyzing poetry, writing analytically, what you would expect from an English prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze poetry better and really dig deep into specific details to understand the meaning of a poem and a poets style ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive overview of later English poetry, with fascinating non-canonical readings from Bishop, Dove, and others. Did not gain many tools to analyze poetry but was exposed to a great deal of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to a host of great English poets from Pope and Walcott. The entire class was driven the question \"what is a poet.\" By the end of the course, Professor Hammer had introduced us to various interpretations of the \"poet\" and challenged us to come up with our own understandings of \"poetry\" and \"poet.\" This course also taught me how to read and decipher poetry. Professor Hammer placed a lot of emphasis on the sonic qualities of poetry, a facet of the form that I had never really considered. This course also taught me how to be a better writer. Professor Hammer sets the bar high in evaluating prose writing and I enjoyed the challenge of having to write clearly and persuasively. ",
            "\u00a0Learned and practiced mode of critical thought and close reading analyzing major English poets. Developed class discussion skills as well as critical essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to carefully read poetry and think about it in ways beyond what the poet is simply trying to say but rather what the poetry evokes about overarching topics like humanity, nature, the sublime, society, etc. I also learned how to better analyze poetry within a paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to classic works of poetry that I had never read before, and taught me to think critically about what it means to be a poet and to write poetry and share it with the world. I became more aware of the role that the context of the time one is writing in can have in shaping the work and how it is received, and how that perception changes over the years. "

            "\u00a0It would have been good to spend a little more time on T.S. Eliot, though I am glad we spent some time on Rita Dove. It was amazing to be studying poets we actually got to meet. ",
            "\u00a0I think we had interesting conversations in class, but sometimes it felt as though we were only scratching the surface of the poems rather than truly engaging with them on a deeper level. I have not quite figured out how to go about this, but I think that maybe we could have spent more time on poets such as Derek Walcott and Emily Dickinson or even on Bishop. I felt like we spent a lot of time on Alexander Pope and Wordsworth, and as a result the later poets were shortchanged. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting but a bit dense at times. We are assigned to read significantly more than we actually discuss in class (or write about in papers). Greater correlation between discussions and readings could help keep this course engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the material was very interesting and the class was engaging and relaxed. The course load wasnt too bad and the papers were challenging and dynamic. No weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I left the class without a clear thesis regarding poetry or the identity of \"the poet,\" which seemed contrary to Professor Hammer's intent. I think Professor Hammer often struggled to lead engaging class conversations and really guide us to the crux of whatever we were reading. Discussions were a bit too meandering, dancing around elements of different poems but never getting to the core. That being said, I think the class was for the most part engaging by virtue of the texts we read, and Professor Hammer offered phenomenal feedback on essays. ",
            "\u00a0I'm aware of the fact that this was a test drive for the \"new\" version of 126. I appreciate the department's efforts to expand the \"Great English Poets\" curriculum by adding in poets that exist outside of the traditional canon. However, I felt as though those \"other\" poets were simply tacked on and didn't have their own time to shine. Most of the course seemed to revolve around Pope and Wordsworth; all other poets felt spread thin. The course could benefit from reducing the number of poets and increasing the amount of time with each poet. It might also be helpful to eliminate a day or two of Pope and Wordsworth. I took the \"old\" 125 last year and really appreciated the simplicity and focus of the curriculum. Chaucer, Spencer, Shakespeare, Donne. Simple, straightforward, and thoughtful. Each poet got their appropriate time in the sun and nothing felt rushed. As I said, while I appreciate the attempt to include a wider spread of poets, I would also warn against sacrificing clarity and depth for diversity. Doing so in this course not only detracted from the \"canon\" authors, but also made the \"non-canon\" authors feel like side dishes. \r\n\r\nTo add in a positive note, the reading list really is phenomenal. I enjoyed all of the assigned poetry and felt as though Professor Hammer had curated an excellent combination of the new with the old. I only wish we had had more time for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The reading selection is very interesting \r\nLows: Not enough set assignments or structure to things we have to turn in ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a breadth of poetic movements and time periods, and does its best to be diverse in the context of the time it's addressing (which was often very white-dominated). It also catalyzed productive in class discussion. It could be improved by having a bit more of a class plan so that we don't end up skipping over many works in our discussion because we run out of time. "

            "\u00a0The course is a pretty good basic review, but with Professor Hammer it sometimes felt like class discussions weren't allowed to just take their own course and let the students build off of each other. Of course, often the class was kind of quiet, but I felt like the discussion could have been more facilitated and less led. Sometimes it felt like he was just waiting for us to say what he thinks we should have said. To be fair, a lot of the time he's right, but it sometimes felt like contributing to the class discussion wasn't that effective or worthwhile. However, Professor Hammer is exceptionally kind and knowledgeable, and more than willing to meet outside of class and help you think through papers or talk about life or whatever. So kind of a mixed bag. Really amazing man, very very kind and helpful and smart, but it sometimes felt as if he was a little too smart and was just waiting on us to get to where he was (which we inevitably didn'tlike I said, really smart). ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was excellent. We learnt about a variety of poets and I think we went into adequate detail with them all, and more if we actually tried - which Professor Hammer encouraged us to do. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student with the presumption that the student has not studied poetry before and is not an English major. I understand that this course is fundamental to the English major both in terms of the course requirement and the skills it imparts. I definitely think it is a good survey course of some of the major poets, but I think that those expecting to be profoundly challenged might be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, English majors have to take it. It's not the worst of courses, and the freedom in choosing paper topics means you can write about what you are genuinely interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it was a good setting to tackle complex writings and th professor was extremely flexible with providing feedback and help. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Hammer incorporated great, enlightening texts not traditionally read in 126, which is reason enough to take his class. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure that I would recommend this course to another student. The curriculum is brand new and going through some growing pains. Perhaps in the future, when the curriculum evolves and becomes more streamlined, I might recommend this course. As of now the poets feel spread thin and the course lacks focus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is not only practically necessary for the English major but helps develop discussion and critical writing skills in a supportive environment of similar majors and ages. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Poetry 126 really allowed me to explore some great poetry that I wouldn't have read otherwise. Its span over history of different English and American poets captured many themes and eras. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very good core English course that lays a solid baseline for more in depth analysis later on. "
