I can now use authentic text to contextually learn new characters and grammars. There is still something to be desired in terms of my spoken Chinese, but that is something that only really comes with immersion, and a college language course can only do so much to provide that. ",

For a large number of concepts, I have a basic grammar pattern which allows me to express it. The course was completely transformative, I am now able to make jokes in Chinese, and use difficult concepts like the ba construction. ",

            "\u00a0none! great class ",
            "\u00a0Excellent professors, very involved and passionate. ",
            "\u00a0Given that the teachers and curriculum are the same style as for CHNS 110, this course is able to build well on an established knowledge base. This is both a positive and a negative, however -- it makes for efficient learning, but that implies very focused, topical learning. More engagement with Chinese media not created specifically for the course would make the experience a little bit more universal -- I don't feel like my Chinese exists much outside of the Li You Wang Peng universe yet, but I may just be impatient. Also, 120 is more grammar-based whereas 110 focuses a lot on pronunciation, and while this is a logical progression, pronunciation in Chinese must be drilled and drilled and drilled before it becomes natural, and some students forgot a bit of what they'd learned in 110 as the semester went on. The teachers, however, know exactly what an English speaker learning Chinese needs in the context and can answer pretty much any question that is asked, no matter how convoluted. ",

This course is incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nI really can't imagine a better way to learn Chinese while living in the United States. The opportunity to engage with the professors and tutors, along with the pacing of the course results in an extraordinarily fast and efficient gain of skills. The professors are extremely good at teaching.\r\n\r\nI sincerely think Yale likely has the best Chinese program in the country. ",
