            "\u00a0This course provided the overview of cell biology. I was able to learn what cell processes occur more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Cell Bio. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives us a systematic overview about cell biology and is very well-organized. It expanded my general knowledge in cell biology. ",
            "\u00a0I solidified my knowledge in the area of cell biology, especially on the workings of the various organelles. It was very helpful! ",
            "\u00a0It brought everyone up to the same level. There were little details and recent developments in the field that were new. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though I received a well-rounded review of cell biology. Before I took the course I wasn't sure where I stood in terms of knowledge and expertise but now I feel more oriented within the field. ",
            "\u00a0Although I am not interested in Cell Biology as a research pathway, I must say this course is very well organized and taught a some interesting insights about cell biology. ",
            "\u00a0Having taken no Cell Biology classes in before I thought this was a nice primer for several fundamental topics in CB. I learned some techniques I had not known before and recent research progress in these topics. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure I learned any completely new topics, but what we covered in class was comprehensive and very in-depth. The papers were interesting and helped me learn more about techniques used in cell biology studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about cell biology that I had never learned in undergrad. This course was game changing in increasing my knowledge of how cells function alone and in systems. ",

            "\u00a0Students don't really have to learn the material, and although the homework helps to make students think about experimental methods and how to apply them, i don't think its conceptually very deep. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assignments usually helped cement what we had learned in the class. However, the lack of feedback kept us from further understanding the concept. ",
            "\u00a0This class was truly excellent, and a joy to take. I think its only weakness was that it was in the early afternoon, so sometimes I fell asleep even though the material was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion part of the course is the most helpful for me. I just have one simple suggestion for it. It would be great if we can receive feedback from the teachers or TAs about our synopsis. I actually take it very seriously and regard it as a good opportunity to improve my writing. Or we can create an anonymous site that posts the synopsis from the students so that people can know about other people's ideas and discuss about them. ",
            "\u00a0The course was able to teach those who had not learned about some of the topics. \r\n\r\nThe lecturers selected had a range of ability to lecture. While this is expected, the long drawn out lectures is an issue for engagement. Reading from text heavy slides is less than desirable, but so is going through more material than can be fit in the lecture time. Being conscious of the time span that is provided for each lecturer, as well as what is really relevant for application for a future career. Some material was included that would be considered too detailed for one who needs broad knowledge for general understanding. These lectures that went into to extraneous detail about techniques or specific papers became less engaging and often lost the thread of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGood professors and for the most part the homework assignments were straight forward and had clearly defined objectives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nNot sure why there was a need for so many lectures on cell signaling and the cytoskeleton. Other just as important topics did not receive the same level of detail and would've been nice. ",
            "\u00a01.The organization of the course, in particular small discussion sections are excellent (this is much better organized than Genetics 625) \r\n2. The grading scheme is fantastic and professors provide feedback.\r\n3. The course could be improved by making sure all of lecturers engage students, and try to be dynamic and active. From my experience when lecturers were engaging and interactive with students that's when I learned the most. Even though, the topics might be completely off my research interests. \r\n However, there were two lecturers which their classes were the most boring  and monotone lectures I had to sit through. As a result, my grades suffered because their material was terribly boring and useless. Please discuss this with all of lecturers to make sure their teaching style improves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Good faculty and good choice of topics. I did like the paper discussions. I actually thought some more of the discussions might be interesting for dissecting papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - There was some overlap and redundancy I felt with some of the topics -- perhaps could be placed closer together in time (Cell Fate and Stem Cell lectures?). I thought the Cytoskeleton was a little too long and could have been compacted, and maybe in turn add one or two more discussion sections? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: overall very good lecturers, and the structure of the course made a lot of sense\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much participation in class, although paper discussions were good ",
            "\u00a0He individual instructors were very well selected and knew their topic in depth. You could feel that most of them enjoyed teaching about what they study and that made the course fun. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n- Weekly short answer questions and professor feedback were really helpful for engaging with content\r\n- Lecture powerpoints were posted regularly and promptly\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n- Journal clubs were sometimes poorly organized (sometimes did not get through all figures) "
