I also gained an understanding of inherent complexity and difficulty of studying legal decision-making in an externally valid way. ",

            "\u00a0Some of the strengths are Professor Kahan's enthusiasm and genuine interest in the subject matter. A weakness, at least for this iteration of the course, is the general lack of engagement by the majority of the students. Discussion seemed to be dominated by a few students (though this is probably the case for most courses). ",
            "\u00a0I especially enjoyed it when Professor Khan would open the discussion by introducing the topic and providing some background knowledge on the topic area. It was mostly discussion-based, but I thought the discussion went a lot smoother on the days such an introduction happened because students had a better understanding of what to focus on. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. The readings are interesting and well chosen, and the discussions were fascinating. There was also a diverse mix of undergrads, grad students, and law students in the class; this diversity helped facilitate the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that enjoys discussion seminars and is already interested in how law and cognition interact. I don't think every student would enjoy this course though. It seems like a student would get out what they put into this course and those that aren't invested would bring down the morale of the class by not participating. "
