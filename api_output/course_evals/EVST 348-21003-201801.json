            "\u00a0This class literally changed my life. I learned how to be a human being, think critically, and work to make real change in my community. ",
            "\u00a0This class is much more than a seminar \"about\" Yellowstone, it's more like a lens through which to understand philosophies of nature and the policy sciences in the context of Yellowstone National Park. It provides frameworks for problem orientation, social and decision making processes, and most importantly for understanding ourselves and our relation to nature. You kind of have to accept that every day you might feel a little dislocated or lost, but with the trust that Susan is leading everyone in the right direction. Not to mention the field trip, which was without a doubt my most rewarding academic experience at Yale and is worth doing the entire seminar for. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Yellowstone, myself, my classmates, and Susan. Thought deeply about purpose and what I wanted from life. ",
            "\u00a0Wow. This class taught me so much, not only about the technical realities of Yellowstone but also about how people think, how cultures are formed, where problems come from, how to examine complex situations thoroughly, and so so so much more. This class is about psychology, sociology, environmental science, problem solving, and conflict resolution. I learned how to be an effective leader, a responsible citizen, and reflective human being. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to ask questions and break down dialogues to their roots to find common ground ",
            "\u00a0Valuable critical thinking skills, specifically how to think about how I think and others think (i.e. metacognition); social process ",
            "\u00a0This is by far the best class I've taken at Yale. It so far exceeded my expectations and taught me more about myself and my priorities than I thoughts possible. Everyone should apply to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, it's incredibly difficult to describe. We went beyond the scope of Yellowstone quite quickly, diving into human nature and reevaluating all of our deepest assumptions and values. In a few ways, I think I approach the world a bit differently now, even if I didn't completely change my base values and life goals. At its core, Yellowstone and Global Change gives you a new way to approach issues and problems, and makes you think critically about the world around you. ",

            "\u00a0The class is amazingly strong. The only weakness is that it is only 1 day a week! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the field trip, the diversity of perspectives that are accepted to be in the class, the staggering depth of experience that Susan brings, the idea of the class itself is unlike anything else offered in environmental studies or at Yale more broadly\r\nWeaknesses: lack of clear structure can make each week feel sort of random, the readings and class discussion are almost entirely centered around Susan's work and way of seeing the world which, although highly valuable, sometimes made it feel like there was a clear \"right\" and \"wrong\" and made it hard to develop a personal perspective on the material, the class didn't really operate as a true seminar until after the trip and instead relied on class presentations we would make to each other which felt like summary material and not really critical inquiry ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the fieldtrip. The trip is quite frankly the centerpiece of the class: I learned so much and made genuine friendships. Weaknesses were the seminar environment-- we often got sidetracked or repetitive with the way conversation went. ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely strong. Professor Clark is incredibly knowledgable and is able to teach without you ever realizing that you are learning. The readings are perfectly crafted: there aren't so many that you feel overwhelmed and disinclined to do them, and they are extremely applicable. The experiential focus makes the at-times-heady concepts more tangible, and I feel like this really facilitated my learning of them. In particular, the field trip made the class. Learning the facts and concepts would not have been nearly as successful if we hadn't gotten to see them play out in real time and to discuss them with each other, our professor, and other professionals in the region. This field trip reminded me of why conservation matters to me, and seriously made me reconsider what I thought I could do to make the largest and most long-lasting impact on the communities that matter to me. At times, the class is disorganized, and Professor Clark often interrupts students with her own reflections, which can be off-putting , but she does so to help guide the discussion. The one thing that I wished is that Professor Clark walked us through applying the concepts in a step by step manner, or assigned a research paper for us to read that she though applied them well. The final paper was super fun to write. I got to explore complex issues that I found fascinating and writing it really made me realize how much I had learned and how much I had grown in this class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great exploration of a brilliant policy framework; engaging and exciting; unpredictable\r\nweaknesses: sometimes too unpredictable, could use a bit more structure ",
            "\u00a0I've never taken a course like this before. I thought this course would involve a mixture of environmental studies and political science, and that wasn't quite right, to say the least. Yellowstone defies categorization. We spent a lot less time than I expected talking about \"the issues\" themselves, and a lot of time talking about the fundamentals of people and society. To a certain extent, the field trip to Yellowstone is the course, and the field trip is absolutely fantastic. It's the sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you hope for at Yale. Not only do you meet so many interesting and informative people, but you also have a fantastic time and bond with your classmates while discussing your deepest values and assumptions. To be perfectly honest, I often found this course incredibly frustrating. Sometimes I was desperate to talk about less abstract content, and it often felt like any dissenting opinion from the prevailing class norm was not quite welcomed. So yes, I spent a lot of this class feeling frustrated and confounded. But it was very worth it. I learned a new way of thinking, and I spent so much time outside of class thinking about the material. Our discussions bled into my conversations with family and friends, and I've never taken a class that's made me think quite so much -- not just about the class, but about *everything*. I was skeptical that I'd get so much out of this course, but I was genuinely challenged, and it meant I was able to examine my opinions, and either change them or strengthen them. An incredibly rewarding course that I often didn't realize was so important until after the fact. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: hands-on learning, unconventional teaching style, concrete topics, and wise professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the syllabus could include more information on environmental justice topics in relation to the creation of the \"West\" in order to provide a more comprehensive and crucial set of knowledge to help frame the issues currently facing Yellowstone. These topics may include warfare against Indians in creating the parks, narratives of people of color in the West, and points about classism in conservation. ",
            "\u00a0Class time was not well utilized in my opinion. We had very abstract and unguided conversations and we didnt discuss enough actual cases studies and factual information about problems in Yellowstone "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS IF IT IS THE ONLY THING YOU DO AT YALE. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in (12 students out of 70 shoppers were accepted in my year), do it. The field trip makes the whole class worth it. I was sometimes frustrated by the stilted in-class discussions and homogeneity of reading but was also profoundly changed by Susan's feedback and insight. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course. It is very unique, but completely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But know that you're not going to have the Yale Seminar Experience. Instead, you'll fumble through class, desperately making eye contact with a friend across the room as conversation veers in directions you were not expecting and that at times feel unproductive. That being said-- this class is still extraordinary. Susan is an incredible strength. Meet people where they are in the classroom and on the field trip and you will gain a great deal. The field trip is worth taking the class for, just know what you're in for. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Absolutely. This class is the most influential, most engaging, and most fun class I have taken. I know this class will influence the way I think about problems (environmental and others) for the rest of my educational and professional career. I seriously cannot give enough praise and I wish I could take it again next year! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is a really valuable deviation from other Yale classes and it made me think in a different way that will impact me for the rest of my life. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Definitely take this class if you're interested in conservation issues, the environment and/or policy. Super fun class and an amazing experience. Trip to Yellowstone was the BOMB. Would highly suggest if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Apply 4 times if you have to  it's the single most fulfilling class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Frustrations aside, I would absolutely, wholeheartedly recommend this course. I'd recommend really reading the syllabus, and maybe talk to a course alumnus, to see what you're getting into, because it probably isn't anything close to what you'd expect. But absolutely send in an application and take this course if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0The trip to Yellowstone was the absolute highlight, not only because it was fun but because it was where we learned the most. That said, it might not be worth taking the class solely for the field trip "
