I am in graduate school to engage with professors and other students and that was not really possible in this setting. It was a great, interesting course and Professor White was great but the course format really put me off. ",
            "\u00a0I do not like that this course was online. I was hesitant about it in the first place but think I would have got a lot more out of the material if it were an in person course where I could have heard my classmates questions and thoughts on the different items discussed. I also think the assignments were too repetitive. I like the idea of the 4 goals but the assignments for each goal should have varied a bit. Having to write the same paper 4 times became quite burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0The course was alright. I feel like a lot of the lecture material comprised of general knowledge... I don't think I really learned anything new. We got a pretty shallow overview of a lot of the material presented in class, especially in the mental health unit. I think we could have gone a bit deeper and explore the issues as being multi-faceted. I do wish the course wasn't delivered online. Because the course was online, I ended up putting it off till last minute and didn't prioritize it alongside my other courses. I did appreciate the goal-setting aspect of the course, though. It went great in conjunction with the lecture material and the real-life application was a nice challenge. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-delivered in an online format.  It was a good overview of wellness topics and how they might impact public health.  I cannot comment on the teaching quality of the TFs, as they did not teach.  My only interaction with them was looking at their comments and grades for my assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course because it helped me focus on self-care during graduate school. I think the course is great the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0The online component of this course made it convenient yet very difficult to engage with the material. The workload was higher for any other class I was taken which I found to be strange for an online course. The behavior changes were interested but pretty stressful. I felt the need to strictly follow my behavior changes for the course of the semester in order to receive extra credit at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I did not particularly enjoy this course, or feel that it integrated itself well with the other core classes I took this semester. It felt like an outlier course of some sorts, in that the material was largely isolated from the others. For example, I used biostats in epidemiology and vice versa, as well as integrating both of those in infectious diseases. \r\n\r\nThis class felt more of a personal project, in which I set personal goals for myself just to evaluate myself as a person throughout the semester. I wish there was more study design incorporated into the course, so that an investigative line of thinking is established. More assignments dedicated to a broad public health application would serve the course well, rather than focusing on individual behaviors and feats. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive and thorough. I like the interdisciplinary approach; I often found that material from SBS505 was applicable to my other classes! The behavior change assessments were kind of tedious but I understand why they are important. ",

            "\u00a0the online format was less than ideal ",
            "\u00a0If the point of these course of reviews is unrestrained candor for the purpose of improving the pedagogical experience at the Yale School of Public Health, then I would appreciate that my response not be censored. SBS 505 is an absolute and total waste of time. The professor simply assigns course work for the purpose of allocating each student a score. The grading process is entirely arbitrary, and the rationale provided to us was that only students who go above and beyond will receive the grade of Honors. Now, I completely agree with this premise. However, the nature of the coursework assigned in this particular class is absolutely menial. There is no learning taking place. Most of the assignments are given for the soul purpose of assigning grades. In order to achieve the highest possible grade, one must engage in activities that offer little to no  actual learning, which to me is simply paradoxical to the purpose of our being here. This subjective and arbitrary grading process has done nothing but worsen my chances at getting into a competitive graduate program in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Not a huge fan of the online format, assignments weren't particularly difficult, I didn't feel like they expanded my knowledge of public health ",

            "\u00a0Interesting course. Learn by practice. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized course. \r\n\r\nHowever, because it is an online course, it sometimes prevented students from knowing about others' progress and hearing about each other's experience and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Good! ",
            "\u00a0Course was well organized and content rich. More could've been done for office hours and face to face engagement. ",

            "\u00a0Really enjoyed the weekly projects. The write-ups were redundant, however, and this course likely should have had IRB approval for the data that is gathered and used in research papers. The taped lectures were great. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was really interesting, but I would have gotten much more out of it if not for the online format. I wish it was an in-person course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - adaptable to student schedules. Focuses on implementation work and understanding how feasible it is for vulnerable populations. Weaknesses - lack of interaction with students in class. ",
            "\u00a0This seemed like a relatively pointless course. The material was so basic I have a hard time imaging how anyone could have not been exposed to it before now. We all know that getting people to eat their vegetables is hard and that sleep deprivation causes stress and vice versa. It was all common sense, I didn't do any of the readings and skipped the majority of the lectures.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of the problem this term was the online set up. The lectures were delivered in this very weird quasi-talk show format, with Marney interviewing past students. That in itself doesn't make any sense, because these students have presumably taken the course before? So asking questions like \"what do you think this is\" or \"did you know this\" seemed like a weird charade. I don't feel like having the students on there served any purpose. \r\n\r\nThe behavior goals is an interesting format, but of course were easy to fake. Just write up a thing with correct buzzwords and say you did it and you got full credit. Everyone I know did the work for this on Friday, usually a couple hours before it was due. Most people that I know didn't do at least some of their stated behavior goals, but wrote up an appropriate-sounding summary. \r\n\r\nThe final bit, where Marney is going to publish a paper with this data, seems kind of laughable. There's absolutely no way to prove adherence or amount of time the goals were completed. The beginning \"baseline\" survey was administered the week we started, so of course none of us had social support or a work out regimen set up yet. Making statements indicating that this class improved our health is completely baseless. \r\n\r\nOverall, I feel I learned nothing from this class at all, the material was overly simplistic, and the online platform was a complete bust. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor, the TFs, goal setting is a good exercise for oneself especially during first year.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was less busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Wow this class got me to exercise frequently and for that I applaud it as a very enriching and valuable class. ",
            "\u00a0really loved the selection of topics discussed in the course and how the lectures tried to be engaging and relevant ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class could be better if it has been offered in \"actual\" classes, instead of online classes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I learned a lot from this course. However, I wish it hadn't been an online course. While Marney made an effort to provide students with the chance to meet her (ex: lunches), all those spots got taken quickly and meeting her in person was difficult. Additionally, I found myself often wanting to talk about the material we were learning. \r\n\r\nIf the course must maintain an online component, YSPH should consider making it a hybrid course. Perhaps keep lecture videos online, but then have small weekly discussion sections for turning in homework and discussing the latest topics. I think that would be very conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that covered a wide range of important and interesting topics. The personal health improvement projects are a great way to learn and also an important experience to undertake as public health students who may be trying to encourage such changes in other people in the future. My primary criticism of this class was the online format. I feel it minimized my engagement with the course, instructor, and other students. I am in graduate school to have those kinds of classroom engagements and interactions that were not possible with this class. I feel strongly that YSPH should not utilize the online format for courses during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Content is dull and not Master's-level material--should focus more on the science and public health aspects of the various issues. Seemed ridiculous that so little actual information was provided in the class given how much we pay to learn here. The structure wasn't great--while I understand what Marney was trying to do with having us do our own little interventions in our own lives, this really wasn't helpful with regard to learning material. Also a waste of time. All assignments were busy work with no point. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. I was hesitant about the online platform but it ended up being okay. The TFs were great. However, I worry that with other instructors that aren't as great as Marney, the online platform will be a problem. \r\n\r\nI also wish we had talked more about social determinants of health, health disparities, and intersectionality. For a lot of YSPH students, this is their only exposure to the more social sciences side of public health (e.g. biostats students). I think it's important that we talk more about these issues. ",
            "\u00a0The online course format made it easy to complete the assignments when convenient throughout the week. There were several weeks with significantly more assignments/work though, which could have been better if they were spread out more (for example, a blog quiz, a summary statement, and the intervention development assignment were all due the same week). It was helpful for the assignments to have the list of questions to answer, but perhaps a grading rubric would also have been helpful if provided. ",
            "\u00a0For me, this class helped me form some habits like eating more vegetable and fruits, keeping exercise regularly, which made my body healthier than before. However, I do not like the online format of this class since it reduced students participations. ",
            "\u00a0This course can help you lead a healthier life. ",
            "\u00a0This class was horrible. Lectures were too basic. Premise of doing personal behavior change modifications does not work with an online course b/c so much of what is valuable about this idea is the social support you get through section + going to lecture all together. Too easy, but lots of busy work. Grading was arbitrary and varied greatly based on who your TA was for that section. Also, changing TAs all the time meant it was impossible to build a close relationship with any of them. Overall, this course was horrible. And, negatively affected my mental health b/c I was stressed about the behavior change assignments. Really should not be required for people who have an understanding of the topic already. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly grew to hate this course over the course of the semester. The material we covered seemed to be somewhere around the 6th grade level. We all know vegetables are good for you, why do I have to find a citation for that? \r\nThe TA's had VERY inconsistent grading so you had no idea what you needed to do from week to week. It was difficult figuring out what level of work needed to be submitted to please each TA. \r\nThe course was not meant to be an online course. It was not something I enjoyed doing every week. \r\nThe behavior change assignments SUCKED! And replacing exams with a weekly essay was terrible. \r\nI just really did not like this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that the class help student have a better general understanding of how to live a healthy lifestyle using nutrition, physical activities, mental health and social support with an unique teaching modules.  \r\n\r\nThe interaction with the instructor and TA is very limited. \r\nThe goal-setting and goal tracking process can be improved ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nConcentration on primary literature on social and behavioral implications in health.\r\nInterventions brought the issues discusses closer to home, and prompted students to make active changes in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nExtra credit portion - While this is not a commentary on the validity of my own participation, I would be willing to bet that very few people answered these surveys honestly. This sort of assignment puts students in a bind because they feel guilty about lying about their completions of the behavior change, but they also don't want to fall behind everyone else by not getting these extra points. \r\n\r\nWhat about those who are already on top of many of the issues that the behavior changes aim to address? I don't think the default assumption should be that all graduate students are out of shape, overstressed, eat unhealthily, and have little social support. I acknowledge that these are all issues that widely afflict this demographic, but they are not the default. I feel that the behavior change intervention assignments were posed as if they were the default. Nevertheless, no matter how \"together\" someone seems to have their lives, there is always room for new projects and improvements. ",
            "\u00a0This course was honestly a joke. There was no rigor and I can honestly say that I did not learn anything new. ",

            "\u00a0Very interesting course, very organized and passionate instructor. The material was exciting and relevant, and the assignments were very organized and aligned well with the material each week. The online format was excellent- the best and most engaging online course I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think this course should be taught online. I think that there were miscommunications, a disconnect and I think I learned less because of the nature of the way the course was set up. If this course were taught in a classroom, I could have learned from my peers and the questions they ask during lectures. I also feel like Marney has so much to offer and I only was able to scratch the surface of what she could teach me because of the pre-recorded lectures. While I greatly enjoyed the 4 goal setting style of this course, I think the assignments were too repetitive. I think we should have to 4 goals setting assignments but maybe change up the other writing assignments a bit more so you don't end up writing essentially the same thing 4 times. ",

            "\u00a0I want to preface this evaluation with the fact that I thought the material at hand was interesting and engaging, and that Dr. White is extremely knowledgable in her field. However, having it been the first time this class was taught online I think there are a number of changes that need to be made. \r\n\r\n1. I enjoyed that this class was taught online for the fact that each student was able to \"attend\" class and work it into their schedule where they saw fit. However, it often felt odd watching pre-recorded video lectures that were with students who were all aware had taken the class before. I think in the future it would be more engaging to either have the option of attending live lecture (either in an actual class or doing it virtually like the last lecture of the semester), or perhaps recording the lectures a week prior to their release with actual students currently enrolled. I think this would also make the course more engaging, as the material could be adapted with the cohort of students, and questions/concerns that have been brought up (either on the discussion board or directly to Dr. White) could be incorporated into the lecture. \r\n\r\n2. More along the lines of being able to adapt lecture to the cohort of students, I was a little disappointed that this class was not as broadly applied to public health as I had wished. I thought the material/behavior change units were interesting, and Dr. White did bring in a lot of chronic epidemiology examples and data to support what she was saying. However, as this is a core course, I would have appreciated more examples from infectious disease and health policy. The behavior change units were applied very much on an individual level and only in our reflections did we truly broaden them to public health interventions. I think it would have been interesting to expand the concept to how do we change behavior, say, in a high prevalence area of HIV, to decrease the impact of the disease? How does policy aid in this behavior change or make it more difficult to implement these interventions?\r\n\r\n3. Perhaps my most significant concern with the class was that the grading was inconsistent, and at times, unfair. Going from TF to TF, the approach to grading varied (some thought only those who go above-and-beyond, which was ill-defined, should get honors, some took off points on blog quizzes even when you showed that you had watched lecture and engaged in the readings, etc.). Furthermore, Dr. White mentioned in the last lecture that very few would be getting honors, and implied most with honors would be those who did the extra credit. My biggest concern with this is that many (if not the majority) of students who filled out the extra credit link lied. This was often talked about openly throughout YSPH. While I'm sure Dr. White is fully aware of the bias, in the publication we read from last year's class data, as well as the last lecture discussion, bias was largely not addressed/discussed.Therefore, those of us who decided to be honest for the sake of the research Dr. White is publishing, as well as our own studies/moral reasons, are being punished. Obviously we are unaware of our grades at this time and so do not truly know where we stand in the class. However, I would be quite frustrated if those of us who received over 90% in the class, but did not fill out the extra credit link, receive a grade lower than honors. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the concept of the course--teaching public health behavior change concepts through our doing them ourselves.  I think that having the course in an online structure made these assignments a bit less effective because there wasn't as much accountability and discussion as there could have been in an in-class environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course was severely disappointing. I would have appreciated warning that I would be a research subject during this course much farther in advance, instead of at the end of the course. I also would have liked to know the grading scheme--no other course is so reluctant to assign Honors grades. I would submit an assignment that addresses every prompt and receive feedback that said, \"Great job!\" but I would have received a High Pass (8.4 or something) with no explanation of how to improve my work or why I had 1.6 points deducted. In fact, at the beginning of the course, TFs would grade assignments as they saw fit, but then the instructor would go through and arbitrarily deduct points because she didn't want everyone to get Honors. Instead, the only way to earn Honors was to participate in extra credit, which I declined at the very beginning of the course when I did not know that it was otherwise impossible to earn Honors. Those who did participate in the extra credit were encouraged to commit academic dishonesty, because your extra credit points depended upon how many self-reported days you completed health behavior changes. This dishonest feedback was then used for the instructor's research, of which the ethics were dubious at best. We were given a consent form at the END of the course (which was due for points in the class) and it only had a \"yes, I consent\" button. In order to decline, you had to send an email to the instructor or TF, which was obviously not going to happen because I was worried that my grade would reflect my refusal to consent. So not only did it feel coercive on the part of students, her research does not reflect the quality that should be expected of Yale because students' responses were not likely to be accurate. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-designed, though the personal interventions and summaries felt somewhat monotonous after some time. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first online course I have ever taken, and I appreciated how interactive and engaging it turned out to be. I really appreciated the opportunity to improve my own health while learning about behavior modification techniques in public health. I would have appreciated more significant feedback on some of my work, as I occasionally was confused why I performed better or worse on certain assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The class helped me lead a healthier, more balanced lifestyle by giving me opportunities to create specific goals related to physical, mental, nutritional, and social health and carry them throughout the semester. Although I enjoyed these challenges, the sheer amount of work required for this course felt overbearing at times. It would have been better if students did not have to do so much work, this course would have been more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The class was not very rewarding and will not be helpful in my career, particularly in its online format. ",
            "\u00a0too many assignments each week ... ",
            "\u00a0I had numerous issues with the structure and grading of this class.  In Dr. White's final lecture, she stated, \"as you know, it is a core course, which means that very few honors are given out, and in all core courses, it's only reserved for the extremely exceptional work.\"  From my experience, this is simply not true.  Other core courses have numerical cutoffs in their syllabus, such as above a 90% grants honors.  Other courses started off with last year's class statistics, showing that many students in other core courses received honors grades.\r\n\r\nGrades seemed extremely subjective.  Students would often receive HP+ of H- grades with the only comment being \"great work!\" There was no indication of why points were lost or how students could improve.  We received many \"4.45\" grades, which seems like a arbitrary reduction of points.  I thought the reason YSPH did not use ABC letter grades to to avoid grades such as HP+, so this was frustrating.  I even received a \"B+\" on an assignment, which was frustrating as this is not a grade at YSPH.  This really showed that grades in this class were basically translated into ABC letter grades.\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue was grading not being compatible with what we learn in the course.  Self-efficacy was a major topic we covered.  During the first few weeks of the course, I worked very hard on all assignments, watching and taking notes on the lectures, completing all the readings, and spending time on the assignments.  Despite this, I would continue to score H- or HP+ grades with no feedback.  When a peer asked a TF why many students consistently received HP+ or H- grades, this peer was told that HP was the starting grade baseline, and we would have to go above and beyond to move up from there  The TF specifically stated that they were supposed to limit Honors grades.    As time went on, my self-efficacy decreased.  I felt as though no matter what I did on these assignments, I could not achieve an honors grade, so I stopped putting work into the class.  It is very frustrating to get the same exact grades (HP+ and H-) when I put extra work in as when I put little time into the assignments.  When I stopped putting time into the class, my grades did not change at all.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, grading was inconsistent between different TFs.  There were certain TFs that we knew would grade harder than others.  I am glad that they rotated to make up for these issues.\r\n\r\nI also found issue with the extra credit.  This should be an assignment, not extra credit, as one cannot realistically receive an Honors grade in the class without completing it.  What is more unfair is the structure of the extra credit being based on how many days students completed their behavior change goals.  With the desire for extra credit, students are dishonest.  It is easy to check a box and say that you completed a goal with nobody to hold you accountable.  It is unfortunate that this is the assignment that truly separated Honors from High Pass grades.  In the future, I highly recommend that the extra credit is to fill out the survey each week honestly so that you can get real data, not how many days goals were met, as this is an intensive for students to be dishonest.\r\n\r\nThe module structure of the online class was good. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught online, and I appreciated the flexibility of online lectures but wish there had been some in-person interactions with Marney and classmates (maybe every other week or once a month even). The topics were important to learn and have as a base for future public health work, and the weekly/semester health challenges were fun and helpful to complete. I would have appreciated (and probably been more successful) in the challenges if there had been an in-person check-in about challenge progress/struggles and a more tangible support and motivation system. I think overall this course may have been more effective with online lectures and then in-person discussion sections. Perhaps weekly lectures could be streamed live to those who can watch during a set class time, and then made available to watch later to those who cannot watch during the set time. ",

I feel the online format could work if there was a way to engage students with their projects for each week and encourage more self exploration rather than simply fulfilling requirements, and for every week.

There were some weeks near the beginning or middle of the term when we had almost nothing then all of a sudden we would have two or three writing assignments due in a single week at the end of the semester, which I did not appreciate.

This felt more like an intro to psychology course than it did a public health social and behavioral foundations class. The course would have been much stronger if the weekly assignments were less individually oriented and more public health oriented. While I appreciate the idea of having future public health professionals attempt to make the health behavior changes themselves to see the obstacles first hand to making such a change, it felt largely like this course was only a data making source for future papers to be written about our successes and failures with the behavior change rather than attempting to teach us about public health behaviors. I take large issue with the fact that students only receive extra credit if they fully complete the behavior changes and that the recording system for this was an online survey. I understand that it serves as more motivation for students to complete the behavior change goals, but it is very easy for students to lie about their success with the behavior change goals. For the students who feel that lying is inappropriate, they serve to receive a lower grade than students who lied about their adherence to the behavior change goals. Dr. White should not publish the data from this years course because there were students who had false answers for the extra credit and she should be aware that it would be inaccurate and unscientific to publish incorrect data.

Although it was great to have an easy fifth class, it felt like a waste of my time and I wished I was getting something more out of my education this semester.\r\n\r\nSecond, the assignments all focused on designing individual-level interventions. This strikes me as incompatible with the principles of public health. It was also really invasive to have to provide summaries of my dietary habits and mental health to be graded and evaluated. I found that this class exacerbated some of my anxieties about my body. Also, little guidance was provided on how assignments would be assessed, and grading varied wildly between TFs. I noticed that I was graded more kindly when I adhered to my goals and less kindly when I didn't adhere, even though our grades were supposedly not connected to our performance.\r\n\r\nThis became known by everyone in the class because we rotated TFs weekly -- why? Not only did the online format make it harder to form relationships with any instructors or TFs, but we changed our graders weekly as well. It doesn't make sense. \r\n\r\nFinally, it came to my attention that students were used for data in studies that Marney intends to publish. In my opinion, this is inappropriate. This class is one of two required classes. Students are given the option to opt out, but Marney did not explain what would happen if we said we didn't want to participate. It felt coercive and misleading. ",

Grading nature of the course is ironic to what the course teaches and discourages you to do well in class. while this course teaches the value of positive thoughts and motivation, the grading system where students have a baseline of HR instead of perfect score made me feel very often incapable of being able to receive a perfect score in this class despite my work and effort. While the professor says that this is a similar grading system is used for all the core courses, i think the way this class is graded is WRONG. by only giving positive comments to students and not providing feedback why they didn't receive a perfect score it doesn't show us (Students) what we need to do to reach that exceptional and honors work. it frame it as students can inherently be good at something to receive the perfect score instead of showing the way that that perfect score can be reached. other than this the course is good!

I chose not to complete the extra credit assignment because the thought of maintaining four different goals every day of the semester daunting and stressful, but for those who did complete it, it would have been very easy for individuals to lie about their success each week.  Therefore, I also do not think it is wise to base a study on these responses.\r\n\r\nReturning to the course, there was also a lot of opportunity for discussion that was lost by the course being online.

The information could have more concisely been delivered in much less time with a traditional format, though it may have been more boring in this type of setting. The readings were generally effective in reinforcing lecture concepts. \r\n\r\nA criticism of Dr. White's teaching style that I have is, as I mentioned earlier, that it tends to cater to those who don't physical and mental health and leaves those who do with less to gain and feeling like the material is obvious. This is not coming from an insensitive position. It is vitally important to inspire those who do not prioritize health or who have external barriers that have prevented them from prioritizing it. However, when the course is designed to target this audience, those who already do prioritize health are given the room to grow that the target audience is. ",

            "\u00a0This online course is a good, non-intensive way to introduce yourself to the field of Social Behavioral Sciences. If you already have a background in a field related to this, however, I would suggest looking for something more intensive and, preferable, not online. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course for anyone interested in public health. I highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0It's a core class focused on behavior change. The assignments are annoying but not particularly hard. ",
            "\u00a0I would tell them that the class provides you with a general understanding of some of the social determinants of health, and the importance of physical health, mental  health. nutrition, and social support. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of assignments in this course, but the content is not difficult to master. The class is important for all first years to take, but I wish we could have learned more throughout the semester. The online format is not conducive for a challenging work environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only for the purpose of completing core requirements and for someone whose interest does not lie in the field of behavioral sciences. It is a quick summary course that briefly introduces concepts of behavioral sciences but does not discuss these ideas in great detail or depth. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good overview of behavioral change strategies and how to engage others in health practices. ",
            "\u00a0Would not recommend, there is a lot of money necessary writing and you get no feedback from the time you spend on it. ",
            "\u00a0Really bad, hopefully, they will get rid of this class with the curriculum revamp. If not, at least it's easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is great for those who are willing to make a behavioral change and/or those who have never thought about it. If you can continue your behavior goals throughout the semester, it really makes a difference of your life. ",
            "\u00a0Don't put too much effort into the assignments because you'll get points taken off for minor things anyway. Also, set realistic goals so that it'll be easier to keep them. ",
            "\u00a0yes. Goal setting is really helpful ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. It is easy and you won't have to do a lot of work, but as a result you won't learn as much as you could. ",
            "\u00a0Not a very useful course. I could've done without it and taken an elective. Didn't come out of it learning much. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely broad overview of SBS mayerial, focusing on behavior change. This is a very hands on course that gets you to change your own behavior with class incentives (extra credit). It was tedious and annoying at times, but honestly it was worth it to make healthier choices alongside your peers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is alright, though I think it suffered from the online format. The write-ups were repetitive and I felt like it was mostly information that I already knew. ",
            "\u00a0It is a core course students required to take, not too much work load, and maybe good for you. ",
            "\u00a0This is a useful and essential course for the public health field. I would definitely recommend the other students to take it.  however the grading method for the course is very discouraging. ",
            "\u00a0Makes you think a lot about personal behavior change and how you can utilize your behavior change strategies to implement behavior change programs at a community level ",
            "\u00a0Although this course was taught online and I had never taken it before, it exceeded my expectations.  I really enjoyed the learning my doing nature of this class, and Professor White is truly an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it if you can satisfy the requirement with something else - unless you know nothing about public health. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend, I do not think online classes offer very much interaction. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed this course. I felt that it was very different from other courses and allowed me to focus on behavioral change that I have wanted to for a very long time. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend taking the online version of this course over an in-person class.  It is not conducive to learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0sure ",
            "\u00a0It was nice being able to watch the videos and do the course work entirely on your own time. I would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Excellent ",
            "\u00a0Tedious, but fulfills the SBS requirement. I would recommend it to a student who would rather not attend a fifth class in person and is trying to get credit for an SBS class. I would not recommend it if you want to learn something new or if you do not want a lot of writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. However, it was overwhelming at times, as I believe was the intention. It is a requirement, but I do think I would recommend it to a friend. "
