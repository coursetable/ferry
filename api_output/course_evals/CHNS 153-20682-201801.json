            "\u00a0More in-depth understanding of Chinese culture, technical grammatical skills, extensive vocabulary regarding the arts and abstract concepts ",

            "\u00a0The course is very rigorous, but I think that is essential to improving in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wang lao shi\r\nWeaknesses: Lessons from the textbook were far easier than the lessons that Wang laoshi wrote herself ",
            "\u00a0Meeting every day means the vocabulary is always fresh in your mind, and also gives you a great chance to practice the words in context. On the other hand, the frequent vocabulary tests also demanded that you learn a large number of new words every day, and it often was hard to remember the words we had covered for midterm exams. Perhaps an increased emphasis on the projects and creative usages of words would help both increase class involvement as well as aid in the learning of new words. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was my favorite class at Yale to date. Intellectually stimulating and course work load is high, but definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for anybody with an interest in Chinese, and who wishes to further their abilities in the language. "
