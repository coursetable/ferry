            "\u00a0Lots of stuff from how to think about research design, especially as it relates to questions of causality. Also some good technical skills on how to use R, clean data, make nice looking and easy to interpret charts and tables. ",
            "\u00a0I went from having 0 understanding of R to being able to code reasonably well. I also developed a better understanding of research design. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of statistical methods\r\nA good introduction to using R\r\nCurrent best practices for analyzing social data ",
            "\u00a0I gained quantitative analysis skills, both theoretical and practical. Causal inference, Regression basics and Machine learning coding were the core takeaways from the course. ",
            "\u00a0R programming, research design, greater grasp of statistical concepts (use of computer simulation to illustrate statistical concepts was particularly helpful), and increased understanding of econometrics/machine learning tools and concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course was most useful in providing a great introduction to coding and in making us think about research designs. \r\nBesides great improvements in my coding abilities, I gained insights as to the methods (as well as the methodological debates) that are used in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Although I had a pretty strong base in probability and statistics I still learned a good amount about causal inference. The most important thing I learned, however, was R. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to use R, which I think will be very helpful, and I also learnt how to do some basic evaluations of data that I was always scared of, prime among them reading a regression table! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use statistics for political science in a practice, through data analysis, cleaning, and visualization in R. ",
            "\u00a0I began this course without any prior use or knowledge of R. By the end of the course, I was able to clean and analyze data on my own. I also learned how to read an interpret regression tables which helped me evaluate the arguments of other scholars in my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an introductory survey of practical data analysis, with material on randomization, causation, and various types of regression. The course covered statistical analysis both conceptually and in application, with an extremely accelerated introduction to coding in R. After this course, I can interpret basic quantitative research and regression tables, assess some elements of quantitative research design, and (if my notes are handy) perform regressions on existing datasets.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Covered a ton of material, really felt like I made huge strides in just a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing really comes to mind. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more emphasis on statistical analysis. \r\n\r\nengaging professor and great TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this class was very well taught and moved at a good pace, although if I had taken this class without previous experience in statistics, I think it would have been overwhelming. I imagine it is challenging to teach a course for students who range from having taken no statistics to students who previously worked as data scientists. Strengths: clear and entertaining lectures, Matt and Lilla were very committed TA's, I felt like I made big strides in learning R\r\n\r\nI think some logistic changes could help this class run smoother (listed below) -\r\n- Release problem sets earlier in the week - they take a lot of time and it was always a scramble to be able to do them in the half-week that we usually had.\r\n- Move weekly section closer to when the problem set comes out, and place TA sessions after the weekly section. Matt and Lilla often ended up teaching mini-lessons in TA session rather than answering specific questions; I think switching the order would help them not have to do this.\r\n- Find a bigger room for TA sessions, and establish a more ordered way of running the sessions. There was often no physical space in the room by the time I arrived, and the sessions often felt like a free for all, where the loudest people would get the most attention. As a result I basically stopped going.\r\n- Whenever we used real data I think I learned the most!\r\n- This might be beyond your control, but Canvas makes it really difficult for me to see feedback on my problem sets from Matt and Lilla (I'm not sure I could find feedback in many cases).\r\n- It would be very helpful for lecture notes to be labeled by date rather than by number ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets helped immensely. I believe most of my learning took place while doing the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Some concepts could have been covered in a bit more depth, but this is understandable given the purpose and length of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of coding practice, great engagement and discussions during classes, professor and TAs very responsive and helpful\r\n\r\nWhere it could be improved: \r\n- An overview of research methods/designs, what they are and how they interact with each other, and the ones we would or would not be working on at the beginning of the class could be useful ",
            "\u00a0Alex is a great professor, and he clearly really cares about the material and his students! Would definitely recommend. That being said, this class could be significantly improved if it were taught from a textbook, or if correct versions of the problem sets were posted after the due dates so students could learn from the things they didn't understand! ",
            "\u00a0The weakest point was the connection between some of the underlying mathematical theory and the the practice of \"doing stats.\" Everything else was great. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be helpful to tie together the theory and the programming skills more explicitly. For instance, by having us understand from the get-go that rolling a fair die 10000 times was in fact our way of constructing a null distribution so that we could do a hypothesis test. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think the scheduling was a bit unhelpful - it would work better to have lectures, followed by section, and then office hours. That way, we would have the necessary tools to attempt the homework from the lectures and sections. The way the timetabling was done meant that those of us who went to office hours on Wednesday and Thursday and worked through the Psets didn't always get that much out of the sections, which were also focused on the Psets. ",
            "\u00a0I came away from the class feeling as though I had a bit of a tenuous grasp on some of the statistical concepts that had been emphasized in early stats courses I had taken, but a very firm idea of how to properly analyze data. I learned how to ask good questions about my own data analysis processes and others. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the opportunity to engage in it almost every day. The office hours and section periods were essentially to my ability to understand the material. This is also due, in part, to the capabilities of the TFs.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was the lack of a \"right answer\" to the homeworks. For only one problem set, we went through the right answers and ways to code. Doing this earlier in one of the first weeks would have ensured a stronger foundation in both the statistical concepts and in R. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of material covered by this course is both a strength and a weakness. We clearly covered a lot of ground and, in talking to friends at other universities, are now more advanced than most students after a single introductory quantitative course. However, the course moved too quickly to develop many of the subjects -- some topics were rushed through at the end of class or only covered in office hours. I feel like my understanding of some key concepts is fairly superficial, especially after the final tests, which featured subjects that we had not covered. All in all, I think the course tried to do too much, too quickly. As a result, the class gave short shrift to some subjects and leaned too heavily on office hours, which became as necessary and as instructive as lectures.\r\n\r\nThe timing of the course was also problematic. Having lectures on Monday and Wednesday and then a problem set assigned on Wednesday meant that we could not use class time or office hours with the professor to address questions about the homework. Instead, that made the office hours essentially a course requirement with the TFs acting as instructors giving a secondary lecture. The amount of work in the problem sets and quick turnaround meant that they were only cursorily graded. The lack of feedback on the problem sets meant I was never sure if I had done things correctly or if I was replicating the same mistakes in subsequent problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the homeworks could have better addressed both the theoretical and programmatic aspects of the course by having more questions dedicated to the theory of why to use a logit, how to interpret a regression, etc like there were on the midterms. More detailed feedback on the homework also would have been really helpful (or at least solutions posted) because I don't feel like I was able to fix the problems I was having. "

            "\u00a0Yes. LIke I said above, I think it's a great crash course for graduate students on a number of statistical methods (experiments, regression, surveys) and on the nuts and bolts of dealing with data sets and presenting findings. ",
            "\u00a0It's painful, but a good painful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - having taken statistics courses before, I was unsure whether an introductory class would be appropriate, and I largely went into the class to learn R. I ended up learning much more about statistics than I had in other courses (in particular, simulations, bootstrapping, and cross-validation), in addition to having a good introduction to R. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I would say that you need to have some basic knowledge of regressions to benefit more from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course as a foundation for research design, causal inference, statistics, and data science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a much-needed class in the PhD sequence. \r\nIt's a good introduction to the methods in the field, and the workload it requires provides necessary coding practice. \r\n\r\nFinally, it requires a very high level of engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: many concepts that I'd found confusing earlier became much clearer through Alex's teaching style - to abandon a lot of theoretical stuff and push us to make concepts more transparent through simulations. I now actually know what a p-value is! \r\n\r\nThe TAs, Matt and Lilla,  were absolutely excellent, both for conceptual clarifications as well as programming help. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn how to think about how data is used and misused. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in this course is a requirement for all PhD students. I would recommend to any PhD political science student (and those from outside the department who want a rigorous course on data analysis and research design). ",
            "\u00a0This level of knowledge of quantitative analysis is necessary for political science, and I would encourage students to take classes that develop their knowledge on the subjects covered in this course. However, I would hesitate to recommend the course as it was taught. It is just too much material for a single semester, to the extent that I felt it weakened my conceptual grasp of key concepts. "
