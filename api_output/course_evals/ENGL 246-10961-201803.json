            "\u00a0I learned that implicit is thrilling in a way explicit is not. I learned about the shape of a poem, its surprise and delight. I learned to take risks and listen. ",
            "\u00a0I had never studied or written poetry before taking this course, so I felt like I gained a better grasp on what a \"poem\" really is. I used to think to call something a poem made it a poem, but Prof Gluck certainly does not let that assumption fly. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned how to analyze poetry better. We would discuss a poem for half an hour and tear each line and phrase apart until there was nothing left to discuss. I'm not sure how much my own poetry writing skills benefited from the course, but I did learn how to describe scenes and images much more clearly and holistically, giving a clearer picture in the reader's mind. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gluck challenged us to find life in our writing and pushed us towards the ability for self-critique. I think this class has made my writing in other classes stronger as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself and my writing style in this course. It was very interesting to see how my writing style differed from other people and even how it differed from a lot of the poets we read. It was also really cool to try out new tasks each week and test the waters in areas of poetry I had no idea about. I learned about where to capitalize and where not to. I learned that poetry is a collective art in some ways and in other ways it's really individual. ",
            "\u00a0A really immersive and hands-on introduction to writing poetry, editing one's own poetry, critiquing poetry. One of the best parts of the class was beginning to develop a discerning eyelearning to weed out what is good and what is not. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write poetry. "

            "\u00a0I suppose I wish it were easier to meet with Louise. But she is a very busy woman with many students, and I realize she has made herself as available as possible. ",
            "\u00a0The rigor of the course's weekly poem assignment is great for honing one's poetic voice, but I wish we spent more class time discussing the poems assigned as reading -- and what makes specifically these poems \"good poetry\" -- as opposed to spending the entire time workshopping student poems. I think this would have been more helpful in the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0I was frustrated by this class because I felt Professor Gluck was very difficult to reach and also difficult to get real advice from. Sometimes I felt like she just critiqued work without really helping you improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would say the greatest weakness of this course is the professor herself. Louise Glck is the kind of prof you either really like or really don't get along with. She has a straightforward kind of attitude, telling you exactly how it is (or how she thinks it is) without any kind of fluff or sugarcoating. I happen to like this in a professor, but often the sharpness was even too much for me and I found her one-track mind to sometimes be a drawback rather than a strength in the course. In the beginning she would give us examples of poems to read along with our weekly writing prompt which was great, but sadly as the weeks went on, we no longer received those. I did enjoy the workshop aspect of the course and found that it could sometimes be beneficial for the workshopee, but often students would just jump on Prof Glck's bandwagon and drive the poet into the ground. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course, I'm not sure I can think of a way to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Glck is a truly formidable professor. She certainly lives up to her name and is one of the most impressive editors I have ever met. The way she works with words is awe-inspiring. The class does not have a very challenging workload. It facilitates creative writing and allows you to self-direct. You will be exposed to a lot of good writing and learn from it. Class is pretty casual and fun because you just critique each other's pieces. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One-on-one time with Professor Glck is pretty rare. She has office hours, but it is really a scramble to sign up. If you can't make her times, you will probably see her very rarely because she has a strict schedule. Sometimes class can be a bit slow if a poem doesn't foster an intense reaction from the class. You do not get much guidance apart from edits on paper if you are not meeting with her one-on-one. \r\n-More revision assignments could perhaps be helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Louise glck. There are no real weaknesses - exposure to poetry with glck is priceless. It doesnt matter if you improve your poetry or not - you will learn so much about life and art in general. "

            "\u00a0I loved this class. In some ways, it was my hardest of the semester. I had to think in a different way. Sometimes I didn't know how to make progress, and that was frustrating. But I looked forward to meeting each week, and I walked away with a new appreciation for poetry and art more generally. I feel incredibly lucky to have taken the course. One of my most memorable at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to spend every week of the semester writing poetry and engaging seriously in creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0No. If you are an accomplished writer in another form (fiction, creative non-fiction, etc.) but have limited exposure to studying/writing poetry, I suggest maybe taking a class where you analyze poetry first, or Reading Poetry for Craft. I didn't realize this course was entirely workshop-based and felt pretty out of my depth since I didn't come into the class with a grasp on what made a poem \"good.\" As a result, I spent most of the semester trying to understand that, instead of writing \"good\" poems. I think students either really click with Prof Gluck or never do, so if you get into the class, definitely go off of your instinct during shopping period. This class drained the life out of me weekly, frankly. So if you get a hint of that during shopping period, I would suggest taking something else instead. I always take one creative writing class per semester as a way to stay happy and creatively fulfilled, and this class just frankly was not this for me. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that my recommendation of this course entirely depends on the professor teaching it. Personally, if Louise Glck is teaching, I would not recommend it. I found her \"cut straight to it\" style to oftentimes be too extreme, and I have always been the type of person that values professors who are straightforward and honest rather than sugarcoating any feedback. I found Prof Glck's feedback, usually in front of the entire class during workshops, to sometimes be rude and unnecessarily critical of a student's work. Maybe this teaching style works for some people, but it is definitely not for everyone. The fact that the poet is also not allowed to talk at all during their workshop seems to encourage this extremely critical attitude as other students tend to jump on Prof Glck's opinions at the expense of the poet who cannot defend their ideas or explain their reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes... it is a peculiar class but, to a certain extent, that may come with the territory. It is a privilege to engage with writing so deeply with someone who understands words in the way professor Gluck does. She is direct and will seldom sugar coat her opinion of certain pieces of writing and when they falter. But she helps build them up afterward. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomend this course to anyone interested in poetry. Louise Glck is not only a brilliant writer but is also really good at telling you how to improve and providing constructive criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. If you're someone who hasn't gotten much exposure to good poetry, this is the class for you. Professor Glck is a force to be reckoned with, and it's definitely worth taking this opportunity to get to learn from her. She is a ruthless editor, and you will be surprised at how she is able to draw out the good parts of your writing. The class format is simple. Each week, you are given a prompt, and you will write one poem for it. In class, you will workshop three or four poems chosen by Glck. Usually, they are the best, or most interesting, of the bunch, but on occasion, she will choose one that is bad in an exemplary way. You get to write with a lot of freedom. You will read a lot of great poetry given out in packets. Glck will also recommend specific poets to you if you go see her one-on-one. Try as much as possible to meet her for office hours! She gives great detailed advice. Even though I don't think my poetry got remarkably better, I definitely write a few poems I am proud of, and I feel more confident about it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you take it with glck, and if you can handle feeling like your poetry is absolutely worthless for a whole semester (I mean this sincerely, and not passive aggressively - part of this course is accepting that there exists poetry out there that is infinitely better than yours). This will make you a stronger and wiser person for sure, if you can handle it. "
