            "\u00a0Taking this course was a nice way to get exposes to high level discussions in continental philosophy and critical theory. Definitely learned more about key topics in critical theory such as contextualism, judgement, critique of capitalism, and others. ",
            "\u00a0The legacies and current iterations of critical theory are the focus of the course: we learn both content and formal approaches from a professor with a deep relationship to the material. I understand this class as a group that struck a strong balance between breadth and depth-- much material is assigned for the benefit of weekly discussion, but enough different streams of thought are covered such that one may return at a later time to explore the de-colonization of critical theory, theories of judgement, or ongoing debates about communicative action. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an excellent examination of the current state of social and political philosophy in the tradition of the Frankfurt School. In this way, it sheds light on many of the central problems in contemporary political philosophy as a whole. It left me with many insights regarding the normativity of critique, the interrelation between the economic and the social, and the question of what it means to \"decolonize\" critical theory. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a fantastic survey into contemporary critical theory, as promised by the title. It was great at tracking the pulse of the most important questions being thought about by descendants of the Frankfurt School today. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the state of Critical Theory in the current moment. This involved engaging with thinkers like Nancy Fraser, Linda Zerilli, Axel Honneth and Amy Allen, to name but a few. I knew very little about the tradition of Critical Theory that started with the Frankfurt School before this class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was being able to learn from Professor Benhabib and other sharp graduate-level minds. This course is far more advanced than a standard undergraduate seminar, as it is oriented towards students who already have solid grounding in critical theory. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think the structure of the class could be greatly  strengthened. The syllabus would have been better if it linked together readings more clearly from week to week. Also, some of the topics were just so abstruse that there should have been more preliminary explanation/instruction at the beginning of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The presentation format was a unique way to introduce the material-- the experience of working with a grad student was quite edifying in seeing how different levels of experience engaged with a text and collaborated to create a single document. Class itself is run by Professor Benhabib, and it is all the better for it. Student interventions are taken seriously and occasionally spring into lively discussion about assumptions or implications. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the material we covered, and the engaging discussions that professor Benhabib facilitated. The syllabus at times felt disjointed, though, and we would jump from topic to topic from week to week in a way that could have been better structured. ",
            "\u00a0The class was challenging in that many of the thinkers whose work we were reading were responding to their predecessors in the tradition of critical theory. Having very little knowledge of these predecessors made engaging with the more contemporary thought difficult. I think the class may have been more successful if some time had been spent exploring the history of Critical Theory, or if more background knowledge had been required. Beyond this criticism, I think that class discussions were somewhat weak. One or two people would often dominate the conversation, and it did not seem to me that everyone in the class was trying to puzzle out issues, and questions together. It was more about individuals demonstrating knowledge they already had on a certain topic. I really enjoyed the reading material, but I often felt disappointed by discussion session. "

            "\u00a0In general no. I would only recommend this class to those with SUBSTANTIAL background in philosophy, particularly continental philosophy and critical theory. This material is practically inaccessible if you don't have solid grounding in critical theory. The language is too dense and technical for you to understand the readings. Graduate students and undergrads with experience in this subject seemed to get a lot out of the course. So, if you are one of the rare students who has a lot of experience in the Frankfurt school, then go for it. Otherwise, you will be confounded ",
            "\u00a0With enough background in Critical Theory, this is certainly the next step in exploring its current-day manifestations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course for anyone interested in continental philosophy and critical theory. It presupposes a lot of background knowledge with Marx, Adorno, and Habermas (and will only be engaging and fulfilling if you have that background knowledge). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, but only if they were advanced in political theory. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class with reservations. I am glad that I took it, and I think I learnt a lot this semester, but I often felt that the material we were reading and discussing lost some of its impetus because so much emphasis was placed on the theory. Of course Critical Theory, is theory, but what first drew me to the class was the focus the tradition had on theory and practice, on philosophy, and social science, on think about real problems that exist in the world today, and the position philosophy might fill in interrogating those issues. On that front, the class fell short, and discussion often devolved into talking about what Foucault said about Adorno, and Allen about Habermas, and everyone's different interpretations of Kant. "
