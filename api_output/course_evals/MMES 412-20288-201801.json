            "\u00a0The readings can be overwhelming for people who aren't experienced with the content, so writing reading responses can be hard.  Maybe a bit more guidance for understanding the readings before we do them would be great.  The presentations and the cool class trips we did were awesome and enriching to the learning experience "

            "\u00a0Yes.  Professor Erami is very intelligent, and my mind was consistently blown by the things I learned.  Definitely changed the way I view and understand a lot of things "
