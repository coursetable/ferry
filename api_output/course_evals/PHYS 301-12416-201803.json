            "\u00a0I have a lot of thoughts on this class. I think the biggest weakness, which is no fault of the instructor, is the structure of the class. That's on the stubbornness of the department, which refuses to use any text other than a book by Shankar, which was written in the 90s, is riddled with errors, and is anything but lucid. I feel like this class could be fantastic and achieve the twin goals of both reviewing old math and introducing new concepts, but as it is, the class does both poorly, and I fully believe this is the fault of the book and syllabus, rather than any professor, since this has been a systemic problem with this course. At the beginning of the semester, a full two weeks is devoted to review of single variable calc, and multiple weeks are spent on multivariable calc. Every person in the class knows single variable calculus by heart; perhaps multi can be justified, but why are a full two weeks spent on material people know? And at the tail end of the semester, only two weeks are devoted to linear vector spaces and differential equations, which means both subjects are treated very superficially. People in this class have either seen the aforementioned material before and know it, or its their first go around, and theyre positively bewildered. The course needs to stop relying on Shankars text. There are so many other better mathematical methods textbooks out there that are not filled with errors and much more clearly written. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is absolutely horrible. Steer clear of courses in which Professor Moncrief is teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good attempt at providing a standard mathematical ability for all future Physics (or Mathematics and Physics) majors. It is a novel idea to put all of these major candidates on the same playing field by rendering their mathematical backgrounds irrelevant, but I think a couple things could have been done differently.\r\n\r\nFor starters, everyone in the class comes from a different math background. There are SENIOR Mathematics and Physics majors in that class, who undoubtedly have completed linear algebra, differential equations, multi-variable calculus - essentially the entire curriculum - and are just taking the class as an easy elective to count towards their major. And there are also other upperclassmen, who have seen most of the math in the course, but maybe aren't yet experts in, say, linear vector spaces. And then there are students like me - sophomores and intended physics majors who are required to take this course, either concurrently with, or prior to, any physics courses past introductory sequences.\r\n\r\nFor me, every topic was either (1) a waste of finite class time because I already knew how to do it from previous courses, or (2) totally unfamiliar to me and taught so quickly that I couldn't really learn any of it in the first place. The course bites off so much material, and covers it so rapidly, that it's hard to really learn things like linear vector spaces and differential equations in a few short weeks.\r\n\r\nIt should be ASSUMED, or required as a prerequisite, that every student in that class will have already taken single-variable calculus (both differential and integral, i.e. 'MATH 112' and 'MATH 115' or equivalent) at the minimum, if not multi-variable calculus, as well ('MATH 120'). I appreciated the multi-variable review, personally, but the four weeks we spent on single-variable calculus were, in my opinion, a waste of time, and a lost opportunity to spend more class time on linear vector spaces and differential equations. I spent over 12 hours total on the final problem set (linear vector spaces), including over an hour with Professor Moncrief himself, and ended up getting a 43% on it.\r\n\r\nI put hardly any of this on Professor Moncrief - he is tasked with a great deal of material in a short period of time, with little to no knowledge of the various math backgrounds of each of his students. He doesn't really have any choice but to just reitorate Shankar's main points and move on. Rather, the curriculum of the course itself must be changed. Either the class needs to last two semesters, arranged in a topic progression consistent with concurrent physics courses, or some topics need to be removed from the curriculum to accommodate for the more difficult ones at the end.\r\n\r\nFinally, Shankar's \"Basic Training in Mathematics\" seems to me like a fantastic reference to other textbooks and courses, but, like the structure of the class itself, is too quick and shallow in its dissection of the latter topics of the course,which a lot of students (at least this semester), like myself, simply have never seen before.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the course is a great idea. Establishing a basis (like in linear vector spaces... I remember that much!) for all physics or physics-related majors is a proactive way to avoid future mathematical hang-ups. But it's idealistic at best to think all of this can be done, to the extent necessary for a Yale physics student, in one semester.\r\n\r\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading this. I hope this fair review of the course will prove useful for the course and for students in future years.\r\n\r\nTeddy Hague\r\nYale University Class of 2021\r\nBranford College\r\nteddy.hague@yale.edu\r\n203.308.0500 ",
            "\u00a0I would use a different textbook. The textbook used made the material a lot harder than it was. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Moncrief is great and cares about the experience of his students. This course, however, could use a complete overhaul. The book used is awful, and using it limits the scope of the course. Single variable calculus could be eliminated from the curriculum entirely with no repercussions; everyone who takes this course by definition has to have seen single variable calc already. The complex analysis stuff is super useful, I just wish it was a little more in depth. The use of a better textbook would alleviate problems with time crunches in getting through the material and would introduce the topics in a better way. ",
            "\u00a0This class forced me to teach myself some math -- otherwise nothing about the class was helpful. The lectures were unengaging and incredibly hard to follow, the psets were usually somewhat unrelated to the content, the book is terrible. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good overview of necessary topics in math that will follow may future paths. However, the course seemed very unorganized at times, both during lectures and on the homework. The book was not helpful whatsoever if you did not understand a topic from lecture. Also, the questions in the book seemed like a massive leap from the examples they used to illustrate the topics, making it hard to feel you have mastered it. ",
            "\u00a0This course shouldn't exist in its current form. If someone doesn't already know single variable calculus, then this course is all but impossible. I think the course should start by assuming the knowledge of up to MATH 120 and discuss in greater depth complex variables, linear algebra, and ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to that - sometimes the homework problems were too physics oriented. Make this is math course that's relevant to physics, not a physics course. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covered fairly relevant material to 401- Problem sets were helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, mathematical topics were covered after they had appeared in 401, some problem sets were a bit off-topic. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets should be better aligned with lecture material. Problem Set questions often introduced topics never touched upon in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The professor did not do a good job of preparing teaching us the material and did not seem including touch with what he wasnt assigning. ",
            "\u00a0Very poorly organized. Little to no feedback from the professor. No TF/Section/review sessions/really any academic resources for the students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was quite honestly one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. There are mathematical skills that I needed for my physics class that we did not even begin to cover, and went extremely slowly through material the entire class already knew. I am planning to take both Linear and DiffEq in the future because I did not learn anything valuable from them in this class.\r\nIt could be improved by changing both the textbook and professor, although I don't know how feasible it is to try and teach \"mathematical methods for physics\" in a single semester when students are coming from so many different math backgrounds. Maybe it should be scrapped altogether and just changed into a requirement to take both linear and diffeq? ",
            "\u00a0This class doesn't really have any strengths, it is one of the worst classes I've taken at yale. The TA is fairly out of touch with the class, and he graded very harshly. It was really difficult to do well on the psets even though the content was not very difficult "

        [
            "\u00a0Depends. If you've seen the material before, it's all review. If not, the class will be hopelessly confusing. If the department changes this class to use another textbook, it will improve tenfold. In that case, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if someone that is not Moncrief is teaching ",
            "\u00a0As a Mech E major, i took this as an elective. I have taken Math 115, 120 , linear algebra and Diffy Qs so you would think i would know this class fairly well. However the book that was used and the brief explainations in class somehow made me understand these topics less. The class was not taught well and the textbook we used was awful. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to another student if they have some prior familiarity with linear vector spaces and differential equations. The course essentially summarizes these topics, so going in with no background in either topic  (like I did) makes it much, much harder to learn these things. If the course is modified to address the issues I have mentioned above, then yes, I'd EMPHATICALLY recommend this course to any physics major, or, for that matter, any student majoring in a field which heavily relies on mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0This course touches on many mathematical methods. The concepts are not that difficult but the textbook and teaching made it much harder to understand. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn a lot of math very fast and at a very superficial level, then this class is for you. This class is great to take before you take the math department versions of each topic: it allows you to see the material and become somewhat familiar with it. If you're still using Shankar's book in the future, then good luck. That book is horribly written and the problems are terrible. You'll spend more time figuring out what the questions are actually trying to ask than figuring out the math for the question. ",
            "\u00a0This class is technically required for the physics major, but you should really just take linear algebra and/or diff eq and try to argue your way out of taking this class. I've heard that in the past (with a different professor) it wasn't so bad, but with Moncrief it was terrible. The class basically goes through \"all the math you need for physics,\" which means everything from single-variable calculus to multivariable calculus to complex numbers to linear algebra to differential equations. I'm not sure why this class (which essentially has a multivariable prereq, based on the physics prereqs) needs to go so in depth on single variable calculus, but we spent way too much time on it and everything else we already knew. I was also really confused with who he thought was taking the class. He prefaced every (for real, every single) topic with \"well I know most of you have seen this before.\" Why would we be taking the class if we knew it all before? \r\nWhen it got near the end of the semester, Moncrief realized he was running out of time, so we went through linear algebra really fast and barely got to diff eq, which were the only two reasons I took the class. \r\nDon't take this class if you can at all help it. ",
            "\u00a0As long as the course exists in it's current form where it's taught based on the Shankar \"Basic Training in Mathematics\" book I say skip it and take the math dept courses or watch online lectures - you'll be much better off. Many people that didn't already know the material left the class deeply confused. The course is too broad and the textbook isn't good. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not, or at least not with this professor. I would only recommend this class as a review for a student who is already very familiar with all of the topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0If taught by the same professor I would not recommend the course ",
            "\u00a0No. ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class if you don't want to take both linear and diff. eqs. which is what I did. But this class is pretty awful and I would not recommend taking it unless you really have to. "
