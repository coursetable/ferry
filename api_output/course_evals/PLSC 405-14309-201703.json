            "\u00a0Became a lot more familiar with the comparative political approach! I am now able to look at a research paper more critically and to question the premises on which some of the studies are based. I think that I am generally more prepared to speak about Japanese politics and its current standing on the global stage. ",
            "\u00a0This class really pushed me to think critically about readings and research papers. Given the intimate nature of the class, I learned how to formulate strong arguments and comments to aid in discussion. "

            "\u00a0Weakness\r\nUnengaged seminar that was not engaging due to lack of instructor guidance. Class was unorganized and often confusing ",
            "\u00a0I thought that Professor Tanaka was quite blatantly brilliant and seemed disappointed in the level of engagement in the course. I personally really enjoyed the class discussions, but since the class was mostly discussion based, I found that it was pretty clear that some people were less engaged than others. I like that Professor Tanaka did give that space for folks to talk about the things that they found interesting, but I think a weakness of the course was the infrastructure by which people were engaging with the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Japanese politics and society. Moreover, I developed my critical thinking and comprehension skills. This class really broadened my understanding of the world.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is the lack of structure. Discussions often felt forced with a select few students dominating the conversation. If it did not feel forced, everyone sat there in silence. "

            "\u00a0No. You can't take it anyways because Tanaka was a visiting professor but if somehow he returns STAY AWAY. Class is often filled with useless talk unrelated to the coursework and was confusing ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was generally really good. I know that Professor Tanaka was only visiting, but should this class ever be offered again, I would highly recommend it. The course was a great lens into politics on a day-to-day level, and the lessons I learned about looking about the infrastructures of social phenomena will be carried to all my classes that I take in the future! ",
            "\u00a0This course was lit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. There is very little work, and the content is interesting. Professor Tanaka left to go back to Amsterdam, so I am not sure who will teach this class again, but definitely take it if you are at all interested in Japanese politics. You will learn a great deal about Japanese society, culture, and politics. "
