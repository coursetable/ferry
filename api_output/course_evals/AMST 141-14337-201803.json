            "\u00a0Prof. Ross' approach to teaching The American West was challenging, yet was challenging in the sense that it pushed students to rev-evaluate a lot of the pre-existing ideas they had about things such as Westward expansion in United States policy, native history, cultural interactions in borderlands, and the American West. ",
            "\u00a0I'll take the blame for my share of this, but I don't think I learned anything in this course that I hadn't already absorbed over my last three years of being a history major. This course's treatment of the standard history lecture assignments (two papers, two exams) leaves much to be desired, and there are many history lectures that cover similar ground in an engaging, organized manner. If you're looking for a solid introduction to American history that focuses -- intentionally, rather than inexplicably -- on colonial histories, I suggest Colonial Latin America with Professor Schwartz. If you're interested in the history of the American West \"from the first contacts between American Indians and Europeans in the fifteenth century to the multicultural encounters of the contemporary Sunbelt,\" as this course's syllabus suggests, I'm afraid we don't yet have a course that actually covers that material. I would not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the development of white civilization in the West and its interactions with Native peoples ",
            "\u00a0History of the American West, from colonial times to the present day. A lot of overarching themes, coupled with very specific episodes, examples, and encounters. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a survey of the American West's history: the United States' state-building project and it's consequences on the previous political and ecological entities that existed in North America. We worked extensively on reading primary documents, and trying to assess their uses and limitations. Prof. Ross brings a \"New American West\" viewpoint to this course, so expect to talk about race, class, and gender within the western context. ",
            "\u00a0None. I do not say this lightly, but Travis ross is the worst professor I have had at Yale. This was a complete waste of a term in his course. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of the rise and scope of westward expansion throughout the United States - starting with the conquests of the Spanish in the 16th century and ending with more modern events in American history. ",
            "\u00a0This course, while not a traditional survey course, did an excellent job of developing my knowledge of the historiographic debate surrounding western history and prompted me to think critically about the history provided, leading me to develop my own lens of analysis for western history. ",
            "\u00a0Solid overview of American Western History. Especially strong in Native history and Railway history. Most of the selected primary documents were helpful, and the books selected were enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a new appreciation for Native American history and was refreshingly open-ended in its approach to history. The course neither demanded the \"revisionist\" mindset nor avoided challenging conventional narratives. It presented many arguments and viewpoints and then allowed us to make decisions about the narrative of the \"West.\" ",
            "\u00a0Mostly theoretical thinking about the western part of the North American continent. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the American West, especially the methods by which we study this ever-changing and immensely complicated field. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad overview of \"western history,\" while learning how to challenge the conception of \"the west\" itself. The course offered specific stories that traced significant events, people, and locations--a strategy which worked well in the small lecture setting. ",

            "\u00a0A general history of the American West. ",
            "\u00a0More than learning about the American West I learned a ton about perspective, the importance of evaluating history from all points of view, and of how America today is dealing with the problems of its past. I learned to take notes from a professor who didn't supply any, and to study for a test that I knew little of what it was on. ",
            "\u00a0\"The American West\" was a great course. I learned a great deal about the development of the American West and its role within the broader sweep of American history. I also learned more about historical memory and the place of the West within the American imagination. Finally, I improved my primary source research skills and ability to craft original scholarship.\r\n\r\nMy favorite topics from the semester include: the Gold Rush, the Mexican-American War, Turners Frontier Thesis, the Louisiana Purchase, the Bourgeois Frontier, and the Transcontinental Railroad.

            "\u00a0The readings, lectures, and scheduled section topics got a little disjunct towards the end of the course - I think the syllabus could be cleaned up a bit to resolve that though. Organization ",
            "\u00a0This was the least organized of the 31 courses I have taken at Yale. Assuming the disjuncture between lectures, readings, other readings, and discussions was intentional, this should be fixed. But having discussed this with other students and my TF, it is clear that it was not the goal. The basic course description and goals, as stated in the syllabus, did not match what the course became. Lectures seemed to be about whatever Dr. Ross wanted to talk about that day, which usually was about the same as the class before or the class before that; there was no overarching theme, story, or argument that I can walk away with (and not because I lack an appreciation for nuance). Readings, therefore -- while related to the American West in theory -- often had very little to do with where Dr. Ross was attempting to lead class, and because of this discussions spun in circles. Too much lecture time was spent on nervous jokes, tepid audience participation, and explaining assignments that ultimately had very little bearing on our grades or course experience otherwise. I would not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty interesting but disjointed, and the unifying themes of the course weren't clear until very late in the semester. Dr. Ross was knowledgeable and funny. TAs were a strength as well ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of organizational issues, but I also think it has a lot of potential. Prof. Ross is extremely charismatic, and this was his first time teaching at Yale, so I'm certain he'll get better and better. As of now, I think one of its major weaknesses is the inconsistency of the lectures. Some will repeat past ones, others will be total breaks; sometimes the conversation is at 30,000 feet, other times it's only about extremely specific events in history that are discussed without context - which is tough, given the scope of the course. The class often gets sidetracked as it was almost a \"leminar\" format this semester (not great for a survey course). The lectures, secondary readings, and section readings, almost never lined up, which made the course's narrative confusing at times. Still, Ross offers some really fascinating insights into American history viewed through a western lens, and I have come to think about the US differently since taking it - and that's something that is usually pretty difficult to find in a Yale class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures, section meetings, and readings were all incredible on their own. At times, however, the course lacked cohesion between all three of those. This may be intentionally, but I'd prefer an environment where all the material built off of themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that lectures were always entertaining and interesting. All concepts were presented clearly and readings were well suited to the class. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course was that it was not a survey course, especially in the second half of the semester, contrary to my expectations. Therefore, I do not feel that I am possessing an extreme knowledge of all events of western history or a unified arc or story of the west. However, due to the focus of the course on developing modes of interpretation, I feel confident that I can better contextualize and interpret history that I may encounter and think critically about narratives of western history that are propagated, both in public and academic circles. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed to lack structure at times. I believe the course could also be improved by visual aids in lectures and a secondary source textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Strong foundation in Native history, Western ideology, general timeline of expansion/progression. The sections were pretty disorganized (the assigned materials not the TFs) and didn't really sync up well with the lectures. The lecture material also hopped around a fair amount thematically/historically, could definitely be reigned in. The final exam also didn't test on a lot of the recently covered course material. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the second half of the course was a bit disorganized. I wasn't really sure what exactly the course trajectory was, and it became more confusing as we neared the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered primary and secondary sources while also incorporating modern historical non-fiction works. This large body of material was a strength of the course. The material, however, was not well incorporated. Lecture, the readings for section, and the novels all felt disconnected, like they were separate things. The course could be much stronger if we had intentionally discussed lecture/the novels more in section and if we had mentioned where the primary/secondary sources fit into the lecture more. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course did a good job of subverting common narratives about the west. Some lectures were really strong, especially those that focused on telling a story.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course really didn't seem that cohesive; lectures and readings were often completely unrelated, and there was no clear reason to do the not-for-section readings apart from gaining a few points on exams. A lot of lectures were pretty weak, taking a highly theoretical approach to the material that seemed relatively aimless. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved Prof. Ross's teaching style. I only wished that there was a bit more cohesion between lectures. As the course was taught, each lecture was incredibly interesting, but infrequently built upon previous ones. There was also way too much reading, and the texts required were never addressed in either lecture or section, which made reading them even more frustrating. I would hope that in the future the texts are either addressed in class, or not assigned at all. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is definitely the content. I found material incredibly interesting, and always enjoyed doing course readings. However, the current structure of the course dampened my appreciation for the class itself. With all section materials dumped on students 24 hours before section, it was impossible to read over 100 pages of material to an adequate level. Furthermore, the content in section and lecture barely matched up, and further \"supplemental\" readings didn't match up with either lecture or section materials. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job imparting knowledge; however the format could use some refining. The papers might have warranted better explanation. While we spent entire class periods discussing the papers, it was a bit unclear what was expected of us (especially in the first paper). ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Confused curriculum that tried to integrate an old syllabus and the disjointed half-baked thoughts of the professor.\r\n\r\nStrength: gave a new perspective on the American West ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: cool topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Ross is not the greatest lecturer. Doesnt stay on topic and hard to follow. Too many readings for a lecture class ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the material--it is fascinating, filled with controversies, filled with problems that still affect America today and show us very much about the world we live in. Another amazing part of the course was the trip to the Beinecke library. The weaknesses were the ways in which this material was taught. It was all over the place, often very disconnected and filled with tangents that took away from the true power of the material. The out of class readings had little to do with the lectures, and the section materials had even less to do with the out of class reading. At times it felt like 3 different classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a broad history survey of the American West, admirable in its breadth and usually fascinating. The first half of the semester is well-organized, with a clear narrative progression across readings and lectures; the second half is (sometimes frustratingly) more unstructured. Take this class if you're looking for an entertaining history lecture with a light workload. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-I really liked the mix of assignments (weekly readings & sections, 2 papers, and 2 exams). I thought the work-load was manageable and interesting\r\n-The class visit to the Beinecke and guest lecture from Professor Gitlin were clear highlights\r\n-I thought Professor Ross had a fun and engaging lecturing style\r\n-I liked the way the second paper assignment built off of the first. This allowed us to choose a specific topic and refine and develop our thinking over the course of the semester\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Improvement:\r\n-I wish Professor Ross had used more visual aids while lecturing\r\n-I thought the weekly readings could have been synchronized better with the lectures\r\n-The second half of the course felt like it lost some of its narrative coherence. It was more vignette-based, which is fine. But it felt somewhat discordant with the rest of the semester. \r\n-It would have been helpful to get the midterm grades back before the Credit/D/Fail deadline ",
            "\u00a0I think that Professor Ross is a very knowledgeable and entertaining lecturer who has a great future at Yale. I enjoyed every sequence of the class and came out knowing a lot more about the history of the American West, which, in the end, is the whole point anyway. However, as a young course, I do think there is room for improvement to make this from a good course to a great course. First, I think that the readings could have corresponded a little more clearly to the week's lectures in order to give a clear point to what was at times a decent amount of reading. Second, I think that all of the time spent on the paper in lecture could have been outsourced to section. After all, it was only a 6 page minimum paper, which isn't rocket science. Third, I found it confusing that a 6 page paper had to use both primary and secondary sources. I found it exceedingly challenging to make any kind of meaningful historical intervention in so short a space, and I do not think that is an essential challenge for a student in history to experience. In my opinion, the paper should either have been based strictly in primary OR secondary sources, or it should have been longer to accommodate the bulk of source materials. Lastly, I think that more could have been said (perhaps in replacement of the paper oriented lectures) on the American West in the imagination. There's just so much to talk about! The Western as an enduring film genre (even in Europe!), the Pacific as an extension of the West, the cult of guns, etc. Again, overall I really enjoyed the class, but it can and I'm sure it will get even better in the coming years.

            "\u00a0Yes, Prof. Ross is a great person, and an equally great professor. His course is engaging to the extent that he is fully engaged in the subject, and in conveying history to students ",
            "\u00a0No. The history department has some of Yale College's most compelling courses and most impressive teachers, and I'm disappointed that this was some students' first encounter with history at Yale (not to mention one of my last). For almost every aspect of this course, there already exists a course that is richer, better organized, and more engaging. For a survey of the colonial or early national periods, try Colonial Latin America with Professor Schwartz or The American Revolution with Professor Freeman. For a survey of the Civil War, try Professor Blight's lecture. For Native American histories, try one of Professor Blackhawk's courses. If none of these is available, get another area or seminar requirement out of the way or try something new entirely. I can't think of a reason to choose this course in its current form over another course. ",
            "\u00a0Good history lecture ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class, but be prepared to deal with some organizational issues. The material is extremely fascinating at times, and I think studying American history through a western lens offers some really incredible insights into American history itself - I definitely came away with a new appreciation for US history. The visit to the Beinecke's western collection was enjoyable too. However, the course is disorganized, as the lectures, section readings, and secondary readings all cover different topics. Ross' lectures are super specific or too vague, which makes the class more confusing than it has to be. So if you're interested in American history, I would definitely recommend shopping the class at least - and it will hopefully get better in coming years. ",
            "\u00a0This course is probably one of the best introductory history courses you can take at Yale. It introduces you to the practice of studying, interpreting, and writing history. For experienced history students, it provides a fun survey course that's still intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would never recommend this course until there is a new professor. ",
            "\u00a0This class was far more interesting than I thought it was going to be. Do not expect to simply jump into the wild west of \"cowboys and Indians\" - the course takes a more expansive look at other factors leading up to the formation of the American West and does a great job of identifying different lines of scholarly thought over the course of American history. Do take the class if you are interested in American history and want to learn more about the 19th century in particular. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I feel that my understanding of how to interpret western historical events and historiography is significantly improved and it was a very enjoyable experience overall coupled with a relatively low workload. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material but the class sometimes lacked structure. It was the first year Professor Ross taught it though so it may improve with time. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered over the semester was not your classic American West history, but rather a selection of episodes involving the American West. Dr. Ross is a good professor and his lectures are rarely boring. However, discussion section readings do not line up with lectures at all which is a bit annoying. Also beware: both the midterm and the final are surprisingly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend to history/related majors. Definitely not a gut. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I would warn, though, that this course should not be taken as a fifth course. The reading is tremendous and dense, and the exams are challenging. You will learn a lot and appreciate this course, but you will have to work hard to do well. For history majors who are not focusing on the topic for their major, take this credit/D and you will really enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Hopefully it improves, considering this year was the first time Ross taught the course. The course has a lot of potential, with a strong reading list and genuinely interesting material, but a lot of times it just kinda felt aimless. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in American History in general. It was incredibly informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would if there is significant restructuring of the course. Professor Ross is clearly passionate about the subject, it just seems that the syllabus wasn't as strong as it could be. With lecture, section, and supplemental readings matching up very rarely, it was hard to know exactly what we should be taking in. Furthermore, it didn't help that Professor Ross decided in the last week of classes to make the final cumulative after the final had appeared as covering only the second half of the semester on the syllabus since the beginning of the semester. Overall, the workload is a midterm (w/ IDs and an essay), a final exam (just essays), a source analysis (2-3 pages), and a further look into the source (6-7 pages), so the workload isn't too bad. There is definitely some work  that needs to be done with the syllabus, but I think this course will greatly improve in the near future. ",
            "\u00a0Though this class did not align with what one might think a typical history of the American West would look like, Professor Ross presented the West in a way which was fresh and interesting. The course also seemed to lose its focus a bit in the second semester. Still, I would recommend to anyone interested in American history. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone who has even a vague interest in the West or in American history in general. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Sadly I don't really think I would. I love the material and want to know more about it, but it was taught in a way that made me almost hate it. I was struggling to learn everything and teach it to myself, and wanted to hear more about it but also didn't want to have to hear anything else. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. The development of the American West is such a fascinating (and often understudied) history, and HIST 141 offers a great overview of the key ideas/events/themes, etc. The reading was interesting and the workload (weekly reading, section, 2 papers, and 2 exams) was fair and manageable. In addition, Professor Ross was a great professor with a fun, engaging lecturing style. In short, highly recommended! "
