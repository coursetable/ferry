            "\u00a0I have gained deep understanding on basic knowledge of physiology on nervous system, such as Nernst equation and Hodgkin equation. This acquisition of how voltage gated chancels work helps me understand how nervous system controls muscle contraction, vision, and perception. Further analysis on differentiation and integration of nervous system enables me to reach a deeper understanding on how our brains work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the chemical and physical basis for neuronal stimulation (the action potential), a lot about neural circuitry, particularly in vision, motor movements, and somatosensory perception, and a little bit about neuronal development and evolution toward the end. A lot of content is covered in this course. "

            "\u00a0It is very helpful to spend half of our time on understanding the basic physiological principles concerning the neuroscience. Principles are largely from chemistry and physics, but applying them to biology is another story. Having a clear picture of these principles enables me to think correctly when come to more complex system such as the heart action potential. However, the amount of knowledge I am expected to acquire after understanding the basic principles appears to me to be too much. It is okay to lead a toddler to walk faster but it is truly hard to ask her to run as fast as she can. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is that the content is extremely interesting. The textbook is really thorough, which I appreciated for some of the more complicated topics. However, this class could be improved through a lot of different ways. Kershishian is a really nice professor, but he desires far too much out of the students in this course, which is not reflected in the resources given to help prepare us. The take home exam was incredibly difficult beyond comprehension, considering that he expected in to be 1 hour long (I spent over 10 hours frantically trying to finish it). The course could be improved vastly by streamlining the material he really wants us to learn. What he says in class is different from what's in the handout which is different from the textbook, and the exam would be a weird patchwork of the three resources that was inconsistent and extremely hard to identify. Throughout the course, I was constantly confused by what I was learning, and where I should be looking for resources. ",
            "\u00a0good lectures but often off topic. helpful lecture guides but the ones for module 1 were much clearer than for modules 2 and 3. more practice questions would be helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who at least is a rising junior. I find I really lack certain molecular and cell biology knowledge on accurately understanding, while others who have taken organic chemistry and molecular biology find it easy to comprehend. Still, if you have a strong background on chemistry, physics, and biology, integrating them for this class would be piece of cake. For me, I am learning three new stuff and how to integrate them at the same time is truly difficult. The thing I can do is memorizing circuitries so it is really hard to use this knowledge to analyze a case study. T-T ",
            "\u00a0You are likely required to take this course, so it doesn't really matter, but I would say that you need to be aware of how this course operates. The course is split into 3 different modules that all have a very different focus. The first module is equation heavy and very, very detailed on the ion channels. This wasn't explained in sufficient detail in the textbook or the handouts, and the class notes were very confusion. The second module was focused on neural circuitry of specific sensory and motor circuits, which was very interesting, but there was just absolutely no gauge as to what we needed to know or learn. Every day felt like an entirely different course in what we studying, how we were studying (projector, talking, chalkboard, etc), and what we needed to focus on. The exam was take home so we could look things up, but this meant the final was particularly hard because no one felt comfortable with the material in the second module. The third module was interesting, but so brief there was no real in depth content to it. All three tests were incredibly difficult and there was no way to gauge what you needed to study or how to study beforehand. The second exam was a take home midterm that was designed for an hour but it took me over 10 hours, which is ridiculous. The final required precise knowledge of pretty much everything, which was not possible to learn in the 48 hours between the last day of class and the final. "
