This course is an extension from high school calculus - you go over a variety of topics, such as partial derivatives, double and triple integrals (and integrating over surfaces and solids) and relevant theorems.

The homework is not too overwhelming, but it does push students to review the material that they have learned and occasionally presents a very difficult challenge. It is a good course in my opinion, although I hear from many of my peers that they are struggling because it is very difficult. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - there definitely are a lot of resources that are designed to help students make sure they can do well. For instance, there are multiple review sessions for exams, office hours, peer tutors and online practice resources.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Sometimes lectured might be fast paced (although I feel that the extra resources can effectively offset this) "
