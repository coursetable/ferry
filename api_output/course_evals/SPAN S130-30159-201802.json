            "\u00a0Learn Spanish on a quicker but more immersive level ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my fluidity of the English language and also learned much more about Spanish grammar and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more Spanish vocab and grammar- specifically grammar, and I improved a lot in my oral speaking. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very good for focusing on grammar and developing listening and speaking skills. Went a little to quickly to truly grasp onto new vocabulary every chapter since we would do at least 2 every week. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish language fundamentals improved so much through this course. I also improved my speaking and argument construction abilities with the language. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to speak Spanish and learned many new verb tenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned advanced grammatical concepts along with vocabulary. This course was especially focused on improving speaking and listening skills which was a huge benefit. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak spanish, instead of the usual just practicing written grammer ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Spanish from vocabulary to grammar concepts, and got a lot of practice as well. "

            "\u00a0Strength: Is very immersive and it does lead to good learning of the language\r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of class time seems like busy work. Grades take too long to be put in. Takes time to realize improvement ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Made to easily facilitate student learning and was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great oral practice\r\nWeaknesses- went a little fast (but that can't be helped because this is a summer course), wish there was more focus on vocab ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: I think there needs to more consistency in grading methods between classes. I feel the other class consistently received higher grades and I wish grading had been more standardized for fairness. I also think grades for both classes should be released at the same time for both classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very well organized, great opportunity, teachers and people are great\r\nWeakness: Time flies by! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is the heavy emphasis on speaking so that students have an opportunity to practice all the time.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would say is that there is only one oral exam. I think if there was another one earlier, which doesn't have to be for a grade, this would give students more chances for feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the focus on speaking. I really feel like I learned how to use the language significantly better in four weeks. The weeknesses are the pace of the class and difficulty of some of the materials. We were assigned some readings that I feel I would have had trouble with in English. Also supersite is a waste of time and a significant amount of pure busy work. Another big weakness is the professors took FOREVER to grade anything. I'm literally taking like several weeks per quiz. It made it hard to know what needs to improve for next time. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is great, i like practicing my speech ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if we could go to Spain a week earlier because it got a little boring in New Haven. Overall the course was very good, the frequent practice was helpful. A little more personal feedback on what I need to work on would've been helpful. There were on or two concepts that it would've been helpful to very quickly explain in English; I know that the point of the course is to use Spanish and practice it, but there were a few grammar concepts/questions that would've taken 30 seconds to explain in English, but took forever to explain in Spanish and still left confusion. I really enjoyed the course though. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This period over the summer is the investment period, but I felt more prepared to go to Spain after it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is dedicated to learning Spanish. I undoubtedly learned a lot but this program is Intense. The workload during the New Haven portion is crazy at times. ",
