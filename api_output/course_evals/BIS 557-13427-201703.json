The instructor is an engaging speaker and is able to explain concepts that could be confusing in a very straightforward and clear way, such that they seem quite intuitive. The problem sets and exams are challenging but reasonable, and everything that one might need to know to solve them is included in the course.  The instructor and teaching fellow made themselves very available outside of class time so that we had every opportunity to ask the questions that we needed to.
