            "\u00a0Independent study in Dr. Kriegels Lab taught me a host of important skills that are crucial for research to supplement my growing knowledge of and familiarity with Immunology. Among some of the most engaging experiments involved mouse surgeries and multiple immunological assays including ELISA and FACS. ",
            "\u00a0I worked on independent research for upwards of 10 hours per week for the semester. I learned a lot of laboratory techniques dealing with microbiology and molecular biology, and I learned a lot about my research in noncoding RNA. "

            "\u00a0I feel like the guidelines are kind of ambiguous at points, but overall this is just fine. \"Independent Research\" and all ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized, and I felt that the initial proposal and final paper was fair. ",
            "\u00a0There was not much support with this course, which is what I expected coming in anyway. I think perhaps it would be interesting to meet other people in the course, just so there's a better sense of community among undergraduate students working in labs. However, if this is not implemented, I don't think the class would be lacking either.\r\nI do wish we were privy to the evaluations that our PI's gave on our final reports. I think it would be helpful to hear feedback. In my case, I heard it directly from my PI one day in a lab meeting, but I know other students who felt they received no final feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The course lacks formal structure so careful planning with your mentor is essential, otherwise things can go quite wrong further along in the semester. "

            "\u00a0I think this course is a great way to motivate students to write a scientific paper. I personally used it to write a manuscript that I am planning to send in for publication - the assignment deadline at the end of the semester was a very neat way for me to feel motivated all semester to conduct research and write a meaningful report.
