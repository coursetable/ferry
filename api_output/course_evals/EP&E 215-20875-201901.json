            "\u00a0Investigated the intersection of moral, political and economic thought throughout history (obviously abbreviated due to lack of time). Quite interesting overall. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive understanding of classical and modern political philosophy, stress on the interdisciplinarity of ethics, politics, and economics. Classics is a great introduction into EP&E and would serve majors and non-majors alike. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how comprehensive theories about politics and morality pull together the disciplines of ethics, politics, and economics. This course was perfect to take alongside Moral Foundations of Politics (PLSC 118) because it offered in-depth accounts of thinkers touched on or mentioned in PLSC 118. This course also demonstrated how to seriously engage with philosophy in an EP&E setting. Oftentimes my understanding of an idea in this class was not wrong per se but simply failed to acknowledge the depth of a thinkers formulation. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the political philosophies of a bunch of pioneering philosophers, and discussed both normative and descriptive questions regarding their application to ethics, politics, and economics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful introduction to the ideas of a few important philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped develop my skills in reading and digesting a lot of philosophical writings and learning how to discuss this in a seminar atmosphere. It also encouraged me to think more interdisciplinarily between ethics and politics, with an added third lens of history. ",
            "\u00a0I learn to think of much more medically, and apply modern economic and political thought two more philosophical and broad concepts. I just learned so much in this class, I cant even articulate the extent. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be able to read deeply into the philosophy of different political thinkers and how these thinkers respond to each other and build upon the existing philosophies of their time. ",
            "\u00a0This course enabled me to think interdisciplinarily and historically about the ideas that have shaped modernity. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0We never made it beyond even the first 50% of the assigned reading for one class period. We got caught up in the weeds on a lot of insignificant details. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar is conducted wonderfully and Professor Kapustin strikes a great balance between lecturing and allowing for student discussion. The material was always interesting and reading was lengthy but rewarding. There is nothing I would improve. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent introduction to several important strands of modern political, economic, and social theory, taught by an experienced and powerful lecturer. Very little to improve, except that we got behind and had to schedule a makeup session to finish all the authors. A slightly more structured class period would have helped avoid this. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are plentiful. The focus on such a small number of thinkers was really excellent, as it allowed me to sufficiently engage with each author without having to forsake diversity of thought which could happen in a seminar centered around a single thinker. Further, many of the authors were conservative or espoused ideas associated with modern conservatism, and I found those ideas convincing and challenging of my own beliefs. One weakness is that authors appearing later in the course received less attention because we ended up using more classes to discuss earlier authors than was planned for. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself is fine, though I think adding female/POC voices would have greatly aided the class. Additionally, more opportunities for periodic feedback other than just the midterm would have been greatly appreciated. The reading load isn't unduly overwhelming for a once-a-week class, although the fact that we tended to fall behind did impede our ability to read as thoroughly, since the readings did pile up. ",
            "\u00a0Kapustin is a wonderful teacher. Discussion was always very interesting and what we read was always relevant to class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well structured in terms of its readings and the writers that we assessed. One weakness was that the amount of material, although it made for very interesting class discussions, made it difficult to fully complete any one discussion and we fell behind in the planned syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  he such a gifted teacher, and the reading is so fascinating you just want to do it. I also love the transition of the different authors, you can really find the building on each other. His lectures are invigorating, and he is both approachable and encouraging in seminar and during office hours. The only big weakness that I see, is that we dont move through the material fast enough. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Texts were great, discussions were great, Prof. Kapustin is great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Our discussions led us to have to push back texts to further weeks. I think the class should be made a twice-a-week class just to allot for more time. ",
            "\u00a0I can hardly think of a weakness of this course. I fully enjoyed every seminar session. Perhaps we tended to go off on tangents because there is so much to talk about, but that is part of the fun of seminars. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. It's interesting and the readings aren't overwhelming. Dr. Kapustin is super cool too and very intense which I love. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, it really encourages students to engage with the material in preparation for class discussion and the learning environment always felt welcoming. ",
            "\u00a0Must take! ",
            "\u00a0Boris is a great seminar leader. He expects a lot out of his students, yet he doesn't grade very harshly. Readings are short and thought-provoking, and they all interact well together to create continuity. Please don't start the final paper three days before it's due. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for any student who desires to engage with political ideas that exist outside of the mainstream at Yale. F.A. Hayek, G.W.F. Hegel, and Joseph Schumpeter present conservative, capitalistic ideas that clash with predominant thought in some circles at Yale. Though I do not expect nor desire that students should abandon their current ideas, it is important to understand the intellectual rigor of the other side. Further, Professor Kapustin is a genius, and he will really shake up your intellectual reality. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially if not an EPE major. For the most part, the class was pretty cooperative, and, while some students participated more than others, no one ever really dominated the conversation. I think Boris' half-lecture/half-discussion style was effective, although it might have helped us to use a little less jargon for people who weren't as familiar with philosophical terms (myself included). ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class of the semester. Professor Kapustin is legendary for a reason. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating course and Professor Kasputin is a fascinating lecturer. It will challenge you to think in a new way and is very academically challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, and you have to take it with Kapustin. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Even though I took DS last year, I feel like I have such a deeper, more robust understanding of these political thinkers and how they relate to each other. What a marvelous course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
