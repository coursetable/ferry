            "\u00a0I felt this course provided a good overview of the current status of electric utilities in the US and enjoyed the depth and breadth that this class went into. While I was familiar with some of the material already, I felt that I was able to reinforce some key concepts throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is designed to teach you about the utility industry, its challenges and opportunities. I think that I did not gain a lot from this course, as a large amount was familiar to me from other courses in the energy curriculum. However, I did gain a better understanding of the utility perspective on energy systems and pricing. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so much more than a broad introduction to utilities. It was a deep dive into the impact of the changing energy sector, with various case studies (including a breakdown of rate cases) of utilities attempting to adapt. I feel well prepared for a career within the utilities industry after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a really solid understanding of electric utilities, particualrly how they have historically operated, and how they set rates, decide on investments, work with regulators, and can either be an ally or opponent of clean energy progress depending on local circumstances. In this way it was quite helpful. ",

            "\u00a0They were mostly in line with my expectations, and perhaps even exceeded them, as when I came into the course I thought it would be less engaging than it was based on comments from people who took it last year. I think Larry had worked to update his curriculum a bit, and I was pleasantly surprised with the range of topics he covered. ",

            "\u00a0Would be better as half-semester. The movie Power Trip was fun but not a good use of class time. The assignment building rates was not a good match for students' backgrounds and interests. Better would have been something like writing up another rate case or doing mini-case studies on utility we're exploring. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assignments could have been something we learned how to do or analyze first in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: organized, passionate teacher, nice field trip, clear lectures. \r\nWeaknesses: grading - it seemed like the TA or professor didn't take the time to adequately assess the homework assigned. For example, some homeworks where they really should have taken the time to look through and grant partial credit were not. Just marking a question as wrong or write without the reason why wasn't terribly helpful to the student. ",
            "\u00a0I would love if the professor didn't support everything that a utility does. He must be able to be critical of some of the processes they use ",
            "\u00a0I'd say some of the homework felt disjointed and Larry had great topics and lectures, just some of his slides felt overwhelmed with information. I think a key takeaway for each class could really help bring some of these topics together. Sometimes I felt a bit overwhelmed by the amount of information in each class. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more discussion on the future of utilities and how utilities will need to change to keep up with changing electricity load and consumer preferences. I really enjoyed many of the different lectures and loved the field trip to the New England ISO. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topic, really well informed and experienced instructor, really interesting guest lecturers as well\r\nWeaknesses: Could be more interactive. Would probably be better as a half-semester class and more guest lecturers workng on the cutting-edge of utility work ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Larry's deep experience in the industry, knowledge of the power system and regulatory process, and more broadly the role this course plays within the energy curriculum - it is a nice complement to REPF and ESA and (presumably) Energy Economics, though the latter I won't take until next year.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the 3 hour block course design, combined with sometimes fairly dry material. It made it hard to fully engage at some points, and would have been easy if spread out over shorter class segments. Probably hard to actualize since Larry drives in from VT for the course and wouldn't want to more than once a week, but I do think that would improve it. Also, some of the more interesting components were when a student asked a question and Larry responded based on his lengthy experience. Somehow inserting more of his unique industry knowledge in place of some of the high level discussion of RE technologies (which we get in other courses, and for energy track students, we generally know), for example, could strengthen the course. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were a little dry, but overall I greatly enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are too similar to the readings, creating a disincentive to doing the reading ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the course lectures, although the slides were sometimes fairly dense. I think the course would benefit from additional discussion of energy markets and how utilities and independent power producers engage with them, given that there are limited other courses to learn about them through. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: strong foundation in the industry from a very experienced professor and ample opportunity for self-directed study through the case study and group project. Field trip was a great opportunity to discuss issues with people working in the industry. Assigned reading was very useful.\r\n\r\nImprovements: ",
            "\u00a0I really valued learning directly from a former practitioner in the utilities space, and think this was a great strength of the class. The course mostly facilitated good conversation, though at times it caused us to get behind in the lecture for that day. \r\n\r\nThe slides were very text-heavy, and were not always very visually appealing. For such dense content material, I think a more engaging presentation format would be really helpful. \r\n\r\nI appreciated having guest speakers come in to speak directly about their work. \r\n\r\nI realize the energy sector is still rather homogenous demographically, but I would have liked to see a little more diversity among the experts whose books/articles we were assigned to read, or whose speaker sessions we were assigned to watch. For example, the Brookings Institute clip we watched for a homework assignment featured a panel of exclusively caucasian men that were at least 50 years old. I would have appreciated hearing additional perspectives from women, or people of color, or professionals that are from within my generation. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were good, and the lectures touched on many interesting topics. However, the lecture style was not especially engaging, and a fair amount of time was spent repeating material already covered in the reading. The biggest drawback was that the course focused a bit too much on the traditional  utility model of the past, and not enough on innovative new utility approaches of the future. The written assignments were mostly superficial busywork that lacked analytical focus and did not teach useful skills-- it would have been better to include fewer writing assignments and make each more in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a good survey of issues in the electric utility industry, but it doesn't go enough in depth.\r\nThe weakness is that the class is mostly lecture, with very little interaction with students (the instructor should ask students questions or give students exercises like role plays to mix it up). ",
            "\u00a0Larry covers a lot of material in this course, so students are exposed to all aspects of the electric utility industry. However, that means he does skim over some material. It could be improved by more selectively diving into important concepts. In particular, I would have liked to see a bit more connections made between the existing utility paradigm and how recent trends that are challenging the existing paradigm, such as how the existing paradigm could be reshaped to improve and modernize the grid. Larry does a great job teaching the realities of the utility industry that prevent from some green techno-utopian visions from coming immediately to fruition, but I would have like more emphasis on grappling and overcoming these challenges.

            "\u00a0This is a good course and Larry has a good perspective. I would say the use of it depends on how much you need to know about utilities. I wouldn't say this is a \"must take\" course, but one you'll learn a bit and the workload isn't too intense. A solid option for a third or fourth course, but not the one I'd say to clear your entire semester schedule for. ",

It is a dense and challenging topic at times, but I think it is really valuable to have at least some understanding of how utilities are structured today, and how they are restructuring for the future. ",
