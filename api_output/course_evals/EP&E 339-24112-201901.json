            "\u00a0I learned about the history of journalistic ethics in the US and gained a lot from analyzing the case studies which different weeks of the course focused on. ",
            "\u00a0As someone accustomed to tackling more philosophical and theoretical texts, this course taught me how to clarify and uncomplicated my writing. I feel like I am walking away with a new ability to express myself lucidly and economically. I am so glad about how I have seen my writing and expression improve. Moreover, I feel as though I have become a critical consumer of news. I have developed an ability to see news stories and reporting with more nuance, and to appreciate the complexity of journalism. Finally, this course touched upon key moments in journalistic history, e.g. Watergate, Pentagon Papers, WikiLeaks, etc. I am so happy to have had the opportunity to explore these transformative histories and to actually understand the impact of them on American, even global, journalism. ",
            "\u00a0The history of journalism in America and how to navigate ethical journalism problem. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more insight into the making of a good (or bad) journalist. ",
            "\u00a0Historic cases in American journalism, iconic investigative texts, critiques of journalism, ethical consideration of journalistic methods ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about major milestone cases in journalism history, including Watergate and Wikileaks. I gained insight on the thought that goes into publishing and reporting on contentious stories, and how much care should be placed on each editorial decision. ",
            "\u00a0I had no idea how much I would learn from a course that sounded as narrowly-focused as \"Ethics of Journalism.\" I learned about countless ethical dilemmas, the complexity of every journalistic decision, and what calculations really go into an article, among much else. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of American journalism. It has all proved extremely useful to me as an aspiring journalist here on campus. I've gone through much of my reporting not knowing exactly what the Watergate and WikiLeaks cases entailed, and I found that analyzing the cases of others, through reading a plethora of articles and books, has made me more prepared to take on future reporting cases. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about he history and current state of the of ethics of journalism, and on so many fronts. The readings were so different and they all brought new insight. Jacob Weisberg asks good questions and challenges his students in the best way. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It seemed like everyone was highly engaged with this course because there were high expectations for students and they rose to the challenge. Sometimes the readings were too long to fully engage with, but I really enjoyed most of the readings that were assigned. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is certainly Jacob Weisberg. He is incredibly knowledgable and accessible. However, of more technical note, I appreciated how this course dealt with journalism from various aspects, e.g. treatment of sources, ethics of undercover journalism, evolution of TV news, etc. Another strength would be the writing process. Professor Weisberg offered extensive and thoughtful feedback on every draft submitted before a final deadline. Having him so thoroughly look through papers before officially due proved to be massively constructive before turning in a final product. In earnest, tricky to think of weaknesses. I don't know if I have any! ",
            "\u00a0The class was very engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The variety of assigned readings; getting to hear the thoughts of classmates ",
            "\u00a0Professor Weisberg led the seminar really well. I think the course material was interesting and thought-provoking. I do wish that the classes focused more on the readings (and less of student experiences). I also think that the texts could be broadened to include alternative/non-traditional forms of journalism. Very few discussions ever mentioned race, gender, or class, and we read no works by a person of color. Considering that journalism is meant to report for a large, diverse public, I found the lack of a single book by a POC upsetting. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very interesting and the class was very well organized in terms of subject matter and different types of ethical dilemmas. It could be improved with a trigger warning when it came to the sexual assault week. ",
            "\u00a0So well-structured, Professor Weisberg is so organized, excited to teach, and engaged with his students, everyone in the class was very eager to learn. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0I would've liked that conversations stayed closer to the text, rather than straying off into abstraction as they most often did. However, maybe I'm just used to history and English seminars instead of EP&E ones. ",
            "\u00a0The essays are very broad which is nice because you can  go in any direction you choose, but its also difficult as its sometimes hard to know what is asked for of us. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would. They will get a lot out of the course if they are willing to keep up with the readings! ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you have any interest at all in learning about key moments in journalism history, a desire to become a more critical consumer of news, a commitment to becoming a clearer writer, this course is for you. Jacob Weisberg is also an excellent professor and has a real ability to oscillate between the academic / ethical elements of journalism, and to incorporate the practical / real-time demands and pressures of the newsroom. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this class, if just for Prof Weisberg. It's awesome to learn from an actual journalistic legend. Your writing will definitely improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; if you love or want to learn more about journalism. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in reading about iconic works of journalism and want to delve into the history of American journalism, I would recommend this course. Professor Weisberg is really kind and cares about the class, but I did want more in-depth and complex discussions of the texts we were reading. It really is an ethics of journalism class, with less of an emphasis on actually writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's important to learn about ethical decisions and dilemmas in journalism and in the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Anyone interested or not interested in journalism would enjoy this course, though it would probably help to have a baseline level of interest in journalism. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. Whether you are a journalist or not, you will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would be very interesting to producers or readers of journalism. You examine lots of big ethical quandaries faced by journalists. I didnt always think we got to the heart of the ethical debates. We more so just examined what questions were at play. But that was still very interesting and helpful! Prof Weisberg also offers to read drafts of papers which is very generous! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! I think it's incredibly useful to those consuming the news, as well as those producing the news. Everyone should learn about all of these incredibly complex, and fascinating, issues. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend it to any journalist or anyone interested in Ethics. Its kind of specific so if you are not interested in either of those things its easy to feel overrun by others in the class "
