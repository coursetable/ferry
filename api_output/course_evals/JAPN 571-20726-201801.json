            "\u00a0This course thoroughly prepared me to read a wide variety of texts written in literary Japanese. The readings all seemed carefully selected and introduced those of us in the course to key grammatical concepts. The unit on kanbun was especially productive and taught entirely with materials created by the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to practice reading a variety of literary genres with peers and an excellent peer-instructor who would carefully attend to all of our questions. ",
            "\u00a0Taking Professor Kamens and Mr. Niedermaiers Readings in Literary Japanese course truly improved my literary and critical analyses skills with respect to Literary Japanese and enabled me to acquire the essential abilities to be able to decipher and analyze Sinitic Japanese literature. Mr. Niedermaiers own wonderful insights that he kindly presented in class further developed his students points of view towards Japanese and Sinitic literature and showcased how a single, apparently trivial detail could become the origins of a profound explication of a particular text. Furthermore, the many intertextual and intercultural references and historical backgrounds that the students learned as they analyzed a text in class demonstrated the great importance of interconnectivity within this academic field.

            "\u00a0This course is well-paced and covers a range of literary materials. The readings and assignments all felt very useful and were often tailored to students' interests. 10/10. ",
            "\u00a0Major strength: Professor Jeffrey's original kanbun teaching materials. \r\nWeakness: I am not sure how one would tackle this, but we did not cover as much as we had set out to at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0All of the assignments and class discussions of this course encouraged and realized extensive and multifaceted engagement with each text that was analyzed by its students, especially in terms of Mr. Niedermaiers precise and unexpected questions concerning minute details of analyses and further historical and cultural explications. Also, under such guidance, open and broad class discussions enabled the students to exchange each of their viewpoints and respond to them, thus mutually broadening their own perceptions towards Japanese Literature and Culture. The final project consisting of introduction, parsing, analyses and translation of a particular text augmented the students abilities of interdisciplinary analysis, via its requisite of their writing a cultural and historical explication of the said text in concern. Such structure contextualized the analyzed text within the broad literary and cultural history, and thus the students were able to acquire essential knowledge of historical and cultural significance of the text, as well as deepen their grammatical and literary understanding of it.

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to any student interested in reading texts written in literary Japanese. Requires fluency in modern Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an essential step for reading pre-modern Japanese texts. But it can't serve as the only course. Developing a facility with the language and its many styles and uses takes quite a lot of time and exposure to a variety of texts... ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this class to my colleagues, since they would surely be able to improve and strengthen their grammatical skills for deciphering Literary Japanese and Sinitic writing, augment their literary analyses and broaden their overall knowledge and perception towards Japanese Literature and Culture. Mr. Niedermaiers various and profound commentaries and explications concerning each of the texts discussed, as well as intertextual references, would propose diverse viewpoints towards even a single detail of a particular text, and the class discussions would deepen all students understanding of Literary Japanese and Sinitic writing. Furthermore, interdisciplinary and multifaceted research and analyses skills can be acquired via the aforementioned final project. "
