            "\u00a0My Russian improved a lot!  I didn't start learning Russian in a classroom setting, so I didn't know much grammar before taking this class.  I think I improved the most in writing and reading.  I'm still not confident speaking, but that's my own fault.  There are plenty of opportunities to practice speaking if you're not shy about it like I am. ",

            "\u00a0It's a great class.  I like the way the homework is structured.  I enjoyed reading about Russian culture and history in our textbook and daily work.  I wish we had a few more quizzes to check our understanding.  From what I could tell, the tests were graded on a curve, which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0There should be more conversational practice with the instructor or TA. As in, there should be mandatory time each week that students must converse one-on-one.\r\n\r\nAlso the textbook was pretty bad. The one for L1/L2 was much better for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- It included the actual grammar points/lessons in the text itself and not just at the end of the chapter (the text in this book was just a bunch of examples)\r\n\r\n- The glossaries were actually helpful because they contained words used in the unit. There were plenty of times with this book that new vocab important for the unit was not in the back of the chapter, yet other words we already knew were there.\r\n\r\n- There were fewer helpful appendices, such as a chart of preopositions.\r\n\r\nAs for the class time itself, I felt a lot of it could be pretty boring sometimes. There should be more engagement (or fewer students), but some of the stuff we kept going over was just easy. "

            "\u00a0Yes!  I mean, if you've already taken the previous Russian classes, definitely continue with it!  If you're like me and tested into this class, it won't be too difficult to adjust to the style and curriculum.  Irina Andreevna is so sweet and helpful and really wants the best for us. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking Russian, you have to take it. Depending on the class size, you may or may not get as much out of it as earlier courses. "
