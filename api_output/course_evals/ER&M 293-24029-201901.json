            "\u00a0A full survey of the history of Cuba. (There is substantially more material on pre-1900 Cuba than one would probably expect coming in without any information.) ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Cuba in a class that wasn't just feeding into the narrative that the U.S. has created but one that is more nuanced and complex and beautiful, in all honesty ",
            "\u00a0This class is a real crash course in Cuban history. I feel like I gained a good understanding of the broad strokes of Cuban history and the ways that elements of culture have arisen as a result of historical trends and government actions. ",
            "\u00a0This was a broad survey course over the history of Cuba. Although it was broad, we were presented with many complications that showed us just how complex Cuba is. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about Cuban history and how to analyze the rhetoric surrounding Cuba and the accuracy of the sources. I learned that Cuba is an immensely complex country, and visiting it was an amazing way to find out how much there was that I didn't understand but could start to try to. "

            "\u00a0Laguna should have gotten tenure ",
            "\u00a0There were two class sessions a week. Many times, Monday lectures felt a little scattered, especially compared to Wednesday seminars. Monday was meant to give essential background, but so were our readings. Moreover, much of the material we covered on Monday was inaccessible outside of that lecture, making it hard to engage with the ideas presented on a deeper level. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the TRIP! \r\n\r\nareas of improvement: better connections between Funes and Laguna's portions ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are great. The professors clearly thought quite a bit about which readings they would choose, and we ended up reading works that were largely IMPACTFULsomething not a lot of course readings can boast. The trip to Cuba is also, of course, an incredible feature of the course, which allows real critical analysis of the relationship between history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the discussion posts are a good way to make sure youre engaging with the reading and I liked the way Class was set up for a lecture on Monday and a seminar on Wednesday. Also, the trip to Cuba!! \r\nWeaknesses: honestly, none. ",
            "\u00a0This was not very discussion heavy, and I think that a better balance between the history and the culture could be more rewarding for the students, since the history took up most of the time, and leaned heavily on lecturing. The history also felt very rushed since we tried to cover Cuba's entire history. While it was useful to know about the beginnings of the country to better understand where it is now, it felt like there could've been more time spent on the most recent century. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, spending almost two weeks in Cuba is a MAJOR strength of this class and what tends to attract students (and rightly so). Being able to ground our studies in reality by touring different parts of the island. The trip was incredibly well-organized and structured to facilitate learning. I was definitely able to make connections between our readings and reality. I do wish, however, that we received a bit of contemporary context to frame our trip. Nevertheless, there was some benefit to arriving on the island with a deep understanding of contemporary Cuba (there was lots of learning on the fly and we were able to experience contemporary Cuba with fewer biases). The other amazing part of the class is the research paper (semester-long). I was able to study a super niche topic, and I enjoyed almost every minute of the research and writing process. There are few opportunities when students can throw themselves into a subject area of interest, and this is certainly one of them (I definitely couldn't see myself writing/learning about the topic I chose outside of this class). I think this class can be improved by making Mondays leminars (lecture + seminar) rather than straight-up lectures. That would provide greater opportunities for student engagement. I also think there should be ways to hold student more accountable for the material itself. After doing the the readings and listening to the lectures, I often felt overwhelmed by the material I was learning. However, there were few opportunities to grapple directly with/demonstrate understanding of the material beyond the reading responses, which I felt weren't enough to incentivize me (and probably other students) to do all the readings in their entirety.

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Although the class could be improved in some ways, they are ultimately small things. If you get in AND are interested in Cuba, you should definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal course, I would highly recommend! Both professors are incredible and are really dedicated to student engagement. The material is very interesting and seeing it all come to life in the trip makes it all worth it! Highly, highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Laguna should have gotten tenure ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Both Funes and Laguna care profoundly and are worth it just on their own merits alone. The material is also fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0YESSSS!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a rare opportunity to build a tight-knit community out of a class. The professors are amazing and hilarious. It's a fun class to attend. ",
            "\u00a0The trip is an extremely unique experience but in-class time is mixed. I would recommend this class if you are interested in environmental history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it gives an incredibly in depth study of a Latin American country that is often misunderstood, within a subject that often goes overlooked at academic institutions in the United States. The trip to Cuba was a phenomenal way to learn more about the country. However, I would say that as history seminars go, there could have been more done to address questions that the class had, and less of an attempt to cover all of Cuban history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Taking an entire semester to delve deeply into Cuban history and culture with dedicated students, visiting Cuba, and writing a term paper on a topic of your choice is truly a once and a lifetime opportunity. Although the course has issues, these issues are certainly not sufficient to justify skipping this class. Even though entry may be difficult, I wholeheartedly advise students who are interested in the material to shoot their shot. "
