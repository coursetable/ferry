            "\u00a0I feel I improved as a writer and as a historian in this class. I think that writing a microhistory helped learn how to situate a particular moment in its historical context. I loved this class and would take it again if I could. ",
            "\u00a0By reading important and well-written examples of microhistories, we developed a strong foundation of potential paths to take in our own research. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills into crafting a microhistory, especially because we read important works and well-researched examples of the discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about methodology in the field of history. I learned to evaluate different historical sources and to discuss how historians use their sources. I learned to evaluate the weaknesses and strengths of each historians argument. ",
            "\u00a0This class was designed as both a reading and a writing seminar, and, as such, I honed my skills in close reading and gained skills in writing. It was an introduction to microhistories as a methodology, and as a result, especially of the reading portion of the seminar, I felt that I had gained a considerable knowledge of the different types of microhistories, and more importantly, an appreciation for microhistory as an important methodology. ",
            "\u00a0Read, discussed, and critiqued different approaches of writing microhistories; focused on thorough analyses of primary material ",
            "\u00a0closer readings of single primary source documents, different ways in which microhistories are conceived of and can be used ",
            "\u00a0On how to engage in microhistorical techniques. Particularly through close-readings and imaginative inferential conclusions ",
            "\u00a0The course has been a fantastic introduction to the methodologies of Microhistory. It has changed how I think about engaging with and interrogating a Primary source and made me a better (more critical) historian. It is quite possibly the single most helpful history course I have ever taken. "

            "\u00a0The course was well structured, especially leaving time for students at the end to research and workshop their papers and not have to worry about having weekly extra readings done on top of all the other research. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic and I wouldn't change anything! ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if we had more opportunities to read each others work, perhaps by having discussions of drafts, etc. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if we had more time to discuss each other's drafts and works-in-progress. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-designed. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the writing seminar element had been more intensive. I wish we had writing deadlines and could actually workshop each other's writing. Perhaps, we could have small deadlines that corresponded to important elements of microhistories. For example, we could have had a week in which we had to write the historical contexts and evaluated one another and assisted one another in this craft. The context is one of the most important parts of writing the microhistory, because it places the microhistory in the conversation with other works that have been written on the topic. Another deadline/writing exercise could be the close document analysis. ",
            "\u00a0it was fascinating to learn about the other students' research; it was also helpful to get comments on my own work ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course -- I would recommend a few more readings outside of Europe, since it is mostly a methodology course, but I really enjoyed it ",
            "\u00a0The course is my favorite course at Yale. It pushed me to think about History and Primary source examination in very different ways. The reading was engaging (I think I ended up reading through most of the reading list for pleasure), the discussions were great. I would be hard-pressed to think of negatives, but I would say that there are points when the course felt just a little bit slow, because so much of it is student presentation. While everyone in the course was a joy to be around, it feels like some of the students had more to share about their project (I am sometimes left at the end of their presentation time with more questions I wanted to ask them about) whereas others struggled a bit to fill the time. It would be hard though to balance this without compromising fairness for every presenter to say their piece. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, it's a great course to gain an interesting perspective on a method of doing history and in developing papers or possible dissertation topics. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, especially as a way to expand your set of research skills. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Keith Wrightson is a legend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course gives essential elements as a professional in the field of history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Professor Wrightson is an incredible resource. Similar to the experience in most other graduate courses, the student can reap as many or as few rewards as he/she wishes, depending on his/her engagement with the course and willingness to attend office hours. Professor Wrightson was very considerate with his time and was always there to provide guidance, when it was requested. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a seminar, in which you can focus on your own research, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Professor Wrightson was delightful to work with and a good discussion leader.  The readings were very interesting and the breadth of readings kept the conversation moving and engaging.  The student presentations were also really fun to listen to. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It was a class that flowed well. And it the readings were unique. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course, especially if it is taught by Prof. Wrightson. If you could get in, take it. He is an extremely thoughtful and wonderful instructor, very fair to everyone in the course. "
