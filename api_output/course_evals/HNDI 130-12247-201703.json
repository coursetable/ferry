Since it's an L3 class the focus is more on synthesizing previously taught skills in more complicated primary sources and cultural contexts, and I enjoyed that. The class is definitely kind of disorganized but if you're motivated you can definitely improve your Hindi skills. ",
            "\u00a0Professors Khurana and Sharma did a great job with L3, as they did with L1 and L2. I think it would be helpful to have more activities in which students are speaking more Hindi and, maybe, to watch more movies and listen to more podcasts to improve our listening abilities, but this is nitpicking. ",
            "\u00a0It could've been improved if we had more actual dialogue within the class amongst the students we would already be fluent. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: flexible and accommodating, good textbook\r\nweaknessess: more verbal practice needed ",
            "\u00a0I felt that class was often unplanned. One could tell when Seema and Swapna were trying to stall, or when they printed out a reading right before class. Or the lesson plan was just to 'take questions'.\r\n\r\nA lot of times they'd just talk at us. I wish instead they asked us to use our hindi skills to have conversations in pairs. That's a great time killer and requires no planning! Talk about the holidays and write down any vocabulary you don't know. Memorize it by tomorrow. Easy peasy. "

            "\u00a0L3 was a nice class. The professors care a lot about your improvement in the language and are very accommodating. We didn't learn as much grammar as in previous semesters, and I feel that the pace of the class could have been faster so we could cover more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! It's a really great way to fill the language requirement. The professors are really warm and supportive and it's a more relaxed environment. I think the amount you learn really depends on your level of engagement with the language. ",
            "\u00a0I have loved all of the Hindi classes I've taken. I recommend L1-L5 to anyone interested in learning the language. ",
