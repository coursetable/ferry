            "\u00a0I gained insight into the general laziness and lack of commitment that permeates the behavior of a significant portion of the students who take this class. Because of this, rehearsals throughout the semester were repetitive, dull and frustrating; coachings were full of advice as to how to play what was already on the page, rather than how to build the collaborative skills and interpretive artistry that I previously thought were essential to chamber music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about playing chamber music from 4 excellent coaches over the course of the year.  I also learned how to work with my fellow musicians and deal with people who can be difficult with scheduling or have a negative attitude about the course. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing class that develops skills in playing chamber music, and also working together and advising others. ",
            "\u00a0So much: the coaches for this class are truly excellent, and every coaching offers me new kernels about how to be a great musician. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy Sharp's chamber music seminar was one of the highlights of my freshman year at Yale. The class is structured well so that there is time to rehearse individually, rehearse with qualified coaches and perform for peers. The class deepened my love for music, introduced me to new pieces and strengthened my chamber music skills. ",

            "\u00a0Final concerts were a bit too long this year. Consistency in performance class length would be helpful in planning ahead and juggling busy schedules. ",
            "\u00a0I generally gained very, very little from other groups' playing in the masterclasses. The issues with each group's playing were obvious and had far more to do with lack of adequate preparation than interpretive direction (with some exceptions), and there was therefore little to gain for those who were NOT playing. Of course, performance experience is critical; however, I suggest that perhaps some sort of organized community performance as a \"midterm,\" in conjunction with a mock jury or two and an end-of-semester concert, would be a far better use of everyone's time. I find that masterclasses in general are ineffective unless significant time is devoted to each player/group (45 minutes to an hour at least). This aspect of the class needs MAJOR restructuring if it is to become efficient and productive. Coachings and rehearsal format were generally good; however, there needs to be some sort of rehearsal enforcement mechanism, as this was a serious problem in my group. Standards NEED to be set higher. ",
            "\u00a0The coaches were excellent, and I liked the format of studio classes.  However, studio class would often go quite a bit over time (which often left me little to no time to eat dinner afterward).  I also do not think I was well-matched with other musicians in terms of level and commitment to the course - it was sometimes difficult to try to organize and run rehearsals when only one other group member contributed. ",

            "\u00a0It is amazing, but I wish we could coordinate more coachings ",
            "\u00a0I loved every rehearsal, pieces, and coaching. I just wish that studio classes weren't so long or happening all at once. Especially the concert at the end. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a great structure, with time with coaches, in rehearsal, and time together to hear other groups and comment on others' performances. Wendy is always incredibly organized so all the parts run smoothly. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is that the studio classes sometimes ran over. Other than that this is a wonderful class! ",

            "\u00a0Great course for working w/ great people and learning a new piece! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes certain members of the group are less prepared than others, it's hard to sometimes make appointments with the resident quartet. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class was a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend this course to another student unless they can previously guarantee that the group in which they will be placed is one of standards, level of dedication and collaborative atmosphere equal to theirs (read: your chamber mates are nice, competent people who you can get along with). I have no doubt that my experience  would have been generally positive if this had worked out; however, my group was seemingly randomly assigned and the conflicts this generated basically defined my experience with the class. The masterclass format wastes a large amount of time, as the time allotment for each group is too short to be meaningful and the large majority of groups are unprepared. I became quite frustrated and disaffected by the attitude of my peers and doubt that I will ever be taking this course again. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to play serious chamber music and are willing to put in the rehearsal time, absolutely take it! All of the musicians in this course are outstanding players, and you will grow a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend the course if you want to play a chamber piece. You're not going to find a higher level of chamber music playing as an undergrad at Yale. "
