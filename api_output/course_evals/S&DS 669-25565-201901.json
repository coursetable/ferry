            "\u00a0A lot of interesting topics! I would have liked a lecture on theory related to neural nets, although I realize there's many other things to cover and that theory is still being developed. For example, I was reading a bit today about the universal approximation theorem, which might be an interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Negahban explained the material in a clear and organized manner.  It was also very clear that he was passionate about the subject material.  However, the lack of problem sets in the course made absorbing the concepts rather difficult. ",
            "\u00a01. Coverage of lots of topics, which is good.\r\n2. There should be more homework for students. ",
            "\u00a0the material is straightforward.. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the material is pretty interesting and the lecturer really knows the material. I also really liked the assignment and the final project -- they were interesting and fun. Weaknesses were that we moved a bit too quickly and didn't reenforce what we learned with homework. It was easy to loose the thread of what we were doing and hard to get back on track once that happened. I think this comes from being a grad course where students are expected to be more self-motivated in their learning but I'm used to a bit more support. Having class once a week did not help. In the future, I would have class twice a week and pick a \"textbook\" to follow, even if its just the lecture notes from MIT that were sent out. That will make it easier to review the material. I'd spend a bit more time reviewing the notation and the motivations at the start of each class before diving right back into the proofs. I'd also prefer more regular assignments, even if they're just one problem a week to help us stay on top of the material. ",

            "\u00a0I think it's good exposure but I'm not sure how much deep understanding of the material you're going to take away from the class. I think the workload is light enough that it's worth taking. Good as a 5th class. "
