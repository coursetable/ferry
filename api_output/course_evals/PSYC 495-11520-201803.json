            "\u00a0Learned about intelligence testing and abnormal psychology ",
            "\u00a0After reading so many psychology papers for various intro courses, it was really cool to see and be involved in the process that goes on behind them.  I had to learn how to think about research methods while also thinking about which details might not work due to different confounding variables.  This was especially important when determining how an experiment should be designed.  Overall, just an amazing course to take if you're interested in conducting research. ",
            "\u00a0Research skills, running a lab, communication & cooperation, insights into lab work ",
            "\u00a0I was able to assist graduate students in various tasks such as coding data, running participants, programming studies, and conducting literature reviews. I gained a lot of insight into the day-to-day work involved in research and the process behind beginning a new study. ",
            "\u00a0Real-life research skills, how a lab is run, how to interact with participants, current research being done in the field, etc. One of the most valuable learning experiences I have had at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0This was helpful for completing my lab work. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills from working in a research environment. I realized how succinct procedures must be in order to keep consistency and validity. I also learned what its like to work in a lab and participate in lab meetings. "

            "\u00a0I think it is a great learning experience, except maybe I would require a meeting with the professor at the beginning of the semester to outline some goals for the semester and then a check-in with the goals at the end. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in research. Since the course is an independent study, you have a lot of say into what type of work you do, and this is a great way to get hands-on experience and mentorship in your area of interest. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For a psychology major, there is no better way to understand what grad school/academia track is like. You learn useful skills, as well as one part of current research in psychology really well. ",
