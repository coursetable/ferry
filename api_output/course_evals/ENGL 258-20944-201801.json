            "\u00a0This course really helped me become an overall better writer. I learned to be more clear and concise when explaining concrete ideas, develop concentric circles of meaning, and use little details to contract an overarching point. Most importantly, I learned a lot about sentence structure and phrasing--particularly, the skill of hearing when sentences sound awkward was probably the most helpful one I began to develop (and will continue to develop) ",
            "\u00a0The greatest thing for me was tapping into my emotions. I have never felt like I am a good writer or can write about myself, but this class really forces you to dig deeper and understand what different foods mean to you. I learned a lot more about myself in this class than any other class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to look at food through an analytical lens ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills, as well as my writing process. I also learned a great deal about food politically, socially, culturally, economically, and artistically. ",
            "\u00a0You'll learn a lot about personal narrative writing through reading some of the greatest food writers in the past decades. I enjoyed most of the readings, and they gave me a better awareness of how to structure a narrative. The readings also tell you a lot about the food industry, especially in regards to the tension between ethical/healthy eating vs eating for pleasure. Grading is pretty good, and if you like writing about your life/food, you should be fine. However, getting an A will require consistent effort + talent in writing well. "

            "\u00a0Strengths-- The course was VERY interesting, and every piece that we read for homework showed some direct correlation to the essays we wrote at the end of each unit. Reading example pieces written by famous food authors and chefs and learning about the industry really allowed for a \"bigger picture\" view of the world of food as I has never seen it before. ",
            "\u00a0It is definitely a lot of reading (and just work overall), but if you plan ahead and don't let things creep up on you, work is definitely manageable. Content was fun and interesting, and she feeds you. Overall, not much criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Well done class ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class got repetitive. We discussed each week's readings. There were a lot of readings, but they were very interesting. I wish that I could have had more feedback on my papers and suggestions on improving them. It would have been nice to hear the teacher's thoughts in workshop discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the wide range of writers we read about, and I really enjoyed writing personal nonfiction. It's a nice change from writing research papers all the time. Quality of discussion will vary a lot depending on the student taking the class, because each class we mainly just discuss the readings or workshop an essay. Also, food tasting (cheese, chocolate, bread), need I say more. There's a reading response for each class, but it's very manageable, as you just write your thoughts about the assigned readings. Weakness: it's pretty hard to get an A in the class. Also, some readings were less interesting than others, but that's for any class I guess. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend it be taken Credit/D/F so that the material can simply be enjoyed without having to worry about the stresses of long reading and discussion posts. ",
            "\u00a0I am going to preface this by saying as a STEM major in an English class, I was very scared of the class going into it. However, I came out of this writing the best I ever had before and enjoying the content.\r\n\r\nThere definitely is a lot of reading, but the readings are, for the most part, very interesting. Some are dry, but I found a lot entertaining, and this is coming from someone who hates to read and reads quite slow. I was definitely scared going into this class, but it is so fun and so rewarding. You do about 5 tastings (during valentine's day, you taste chocolate!), and what is better than free food?? She also gives you late coupons for different reasons, which is great for those weeks you have a lot going on. \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this class. Is it easy? Depends on the person. But, if you put effort in, meet with her for essays, and just generally show interest and do the blog posts, I think she does a good job at rewarding you for your effort. I cannot tell you the amount of times she thanked me for how hard I worked, which I think is important because it shows she appreciates the work you do. She really helps you dig deeper with each essay, and if you work with her and show you're trying, I think you'll do pretty good.\r\n\r\nPeople said she was a hard grader, but I'd say I disagree. If you try and go to office hours, she gives you a fair grade. Basically, you aren't going to get a grade you don't deserve, so if you never go in for talks, then don't take the class.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to put some time and effort in, then this is a great class. Would highly recommend!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would great class ",
            "\u00a0This class is very fun. It's a great way to read a variety of writing styles. We read memoirs, recipe essays, reviews, interviews, reports, and even analyzed cookbooks dating back to the 1600s at the Beinecke Library. If you like food and/or writing, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you love food and love personal writing. DO the readings to get most out of the class, and of course, do the food tastings too. "
