            "\u00a0This class provided an overview of the history and contents of many popular American cocktails past and present. It incorporated basic lessons in spirit differentiation and distillation, especially whisky, and covered the cocktail/bar industries more broadly, focusing on the business and cultural aspects of each. Many practitioners from across the industry visited the class, and readings often covered the history of famous cocktails and the people behind them. The course placed some emphasis on writing skills as they pertained to the assigned essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course basically reshaped my understanding of how to drink and enjoy drinking, as well as providing copious insights into the history of alcohol, of cocktail drinking, and of the cocktail industry as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the procedure of how to make specific drinks but more so I learned the history behind each drink and its cultural impact. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a great deal about the history and culture of various spirits, from beer brewing at the inception of human civilization, to the advent of distillation technologies, to modern-day innovations. We also learned about the bartending profession and cocktail industry, and how both have evolved over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about a unique and under-studied discipline. I also became a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make certain drinks and what goes in them. I learned how certain drinks gained popularity and the origin of certain liquors. "

            "\u00a0I know this is the first time the course is being offered and that it was very much an evolving project, so I hope this feedback is more constructive than critical. I thought the subject material was fascinating and the instructors did a great job emphasizing although it is not a traditional academic discipline, perhaps should be, given what the ethics and business of cocktails reveal about American culture and history more broadly. The lineup of guest speakers was impressive, and they were each interesting. The readings were almost all very relevant and interesting, even if they were lengthy at times, and the assignments were very flexible. That being said, it felt like the readings were largely peripheral to the course, as they were sometimes referenced in class but rarely discussed at length, which made the longer readings feel not as worthwhile (I would suggest excerpting or spending more time talking about the lengthier readings, assuming people skimmed them). More broadly, the course felt more like a lecture than a seminar, which was not inherently a bad thing, except that it seemed like the professors wanted to hear from us more (but usually asked us closed questions that did not really facilitate a conversation) without necessarily opening up the floor to make that happen. I would also say especially in the beginning of the semester there was a lot of concern about making sure it wasn't required of students to be drinkers or knowledgeable about alcohol, but I think the fact that those students self-selected to take this course (and I know many were seniors) meant that we would have been comfortable sharing/hearing personal experiences or thoughts on the subject, and sometimes this sense of worry stifled conversation. I personally loved the guest speakers, but thought those weeks could have used some more structure rather than just Q&As (but everyone seemed to agree on this when we talked about it). I think if the course brings in that many (or more) visitors next time it's taught, it's worth making a bigger deal of them on the syllabus/pitch to shoppers, because I didn't realize basically the whole second half of the semester would be spent with them, nor did I realize their visits would be the basis for our final paper. I think more people would have asked questions or taken notes on the visitors if we had known that our biggest assignment would revolve around what they said to us. On the topic of papers, I really appreciated the flexibility and option to pitch our own ideas, but I felt the prompts were almost too vague and that it was hard to come up with unique topics/thesis statements because there were so many possible directions. I think slightly tighter essay prompts would have been helpful, especially because we covered such a range in history/geography/etc. On a final note, the 116 events were awesome and I think our class would have loved some sort of field trip or more opportunities to put our new knowledge into practice! There really is nothing like this class at Yale (when people heard I was in this class, they would immediately ask me all sorts of questions about it, no matter where I was!) and I'm so glad I got to take it in its first iteration. I think making it more of a discussion (without cold calling if possible), culling down the reading list, better situating the guest speakers and assigning slightly more focused essay topics would make it even better for the next lucky group of students to take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible, and had a wide variety of strengths.  Not only was it regularly engaging, the two lecturer system led to some fascinating dialogue between different ideas held by Professors Clark-Ginnetti and Spector.  The readings were always fun, and the sheer amount of freedom in essay topics made assignments a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0It was taught very well ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in the closeness of both instructors to the material and the breadth of content covered. It was a class from which anyone could learn a great deal: certified bartenders, amateur mixologists, and interested but inexperienced individuals alike. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the instructors did an amazing job. The biggest strengths of the course were John's insightful understanding and analysis of the history of Cocktails in this country, as well as the guest speakers the two brought in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I truly feel like I can apply some of the material I learned in this class to the real world. I now look at a cocktail menu completely different. Strict on writing \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not much but was tough on grading, specifically the writing. Could pass as a writing credit it seemed like. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to others, regardless of major, and especially seniors/21+ students who know a bit about their alcohol preferences and would be interested in attending the events/trying new cocktails outside of class. People who haven't taken the course assume it'll be like mixology or bartending, but it's much more than that  it's a new lens through which to look at American history and culture and at the way the US interacts with other countries (not to mention domestic issues about finances, inclusion, celebrity, historical memory, etc.). It would be a great 5th class, a memorable way to end senior year, or just a nice break from the other kinds of classes offered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a010/10 would take again.  Also, take this with TIPS and mixology courses via AODHRI for it to be a lot more fun ",
            "\u00a0Definitely it taught very useful information and life skills ",
            "\u00a0I'd wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. It was a fun, engaging course where I got the chance to learn a lot about a rather unconventional seminar topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. It was unlike anything I have learned at Yale, and they did a fantastic job. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely was unique to learn this material and you can bring up what you learned during casual conversations when having cocktails with someone. Learned a lot on certain liquors that was very interesting. "
