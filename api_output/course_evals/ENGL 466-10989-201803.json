            "\u00a0I learned to write essays to word limit on a biweekly basis. Each week, the word limit would increase by 400-600 words--the task of the class is learning that the size of the essay alters the shape and arc of its content. The final essay of the course is a revision of any one of the previously written essays--the catch being that the revision should be 600-700 words longer or shorter than the earlier draft. \r\nLearning to write through this process was a great experience. The in-class discussion (essay workshops, Best American Essays, Prof Zarin's selected reading of other authors) and Prof. Zarin's edits and office hours (the course requires a minimum of two office hour-meetings during the semester) definitely improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0My prose writing became much stronger and crisper this semester as a result of Prof Zarin's edits and tastes. She has a very particular style and by the end of the semester a lot of us found ourselves tending toward that style, which is a valuable exercise as a writer. I also think I became a much more critical reader of nonfiction, and now have a clearer sense of my own tastes in reading, which will be helpful going forward as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I have complicated feelings about this course (that do err towards the positive)  but I will say that my essay writing improved immensely. Professor Zarin pushed us, and although this pushing was sometimes in a confusing or opaque fashion, it made a difference  probably for everyone in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is all about essay reading and writing so those are the skills I developed. We learned a lot about finding the important aspects of the stories we tell and learning to display those in compelling ways. ",
            "\u00a0I got a much better feel for the essay form -- for what an essay can say, and be, through the readings, my classmates' essays, and our class discussions. I also learned how much a certain word count can hold. (Prof. Zarin referred to this as the \"size of the suitcase.\") I learned concrete strategies for improving my writing -- Prof. Zarin sometimes sat us down and said things like \"don't begin sentences with 'and' unless you absolutely need to.\" Most importantly, I learned to sit down and write essay after essay and to push through even when a topic really wasn't working. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved dramatically, as did my sense of what constitutes a good essay. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write nonfiction, basically. Learned what makes an essay work, as well as my own personal challenges. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would have preferred to have scheduled my/everyone's workshop days at the very beginning of the semester. Knowing my workshop days from the start of the semester/after shopping period would have allowed me to better plan my semester overall. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great workshop group, unprompted essays were really exciting, the way that they increased in length was helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that our readings were limited by the fact that we stuck to the Best American Essays book, and would have liked a more diverse array of selected readings. The workshop was disorganized at times. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were really lively, and everyone in the course was a strong writer and active class participant. There wasn't a lot of structure in terms of assignment dates/who was up for workshop (there's no syllabus or anything; she'll tell you one time what the assignment is then never mention it again until the day it's due, but luckily everyone in the class was sort of in it together/sent each other reminders, etc ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Your writing will get better, noticeably. You will bond with the other people in the class. You will read some great essays (and some mediocre and even bad essays reading the Best American Essays is a nice departure from some other writing classes at Yale, where you mostly read essays the professor has already deemed amazing. It's a great exercise). There is complete freedom  you get to write about whatever you want. This is challenging at first, and doesn't really stop being challenging, but becomes more freeing as the semester goes on. You will become a better writer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Somewhat disorganized. Workshops are tricky because Professor Zarin steps back and essentially lets the class run the workshop. This means that sometimes the first or second person who speaks will seize upon a particular criticism, and then this particular criticism is all or most of what gets talked about during the entire 10-15 or so minutes of the workshop. That's not to say that this particular criticism isn't valid; just that outside direction would be a little helpful during the workshops.\r\n\r\nLike all advanced writing classes at Yale, this is the class that will weigh on your psyche throughout the semester. You will get criticism that feels personal, from Professor Zarin and from classmates. If you haven't taken these classes before, it's good to be prepared for. Not a reason at all to not take the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course depends on the group of students in your class since it's workshop based. I loved my class so I loved the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings assigned in the course were excellent -- I liked that we read the Best American Essays along with the readings chosen by Prof. Zarin each week. I appreciated the chance to write so many essays (and I thought it was effective to increase the word count throughout the semester). Overall, the class felt like too much work: I would have preferred to write one less essay and to have that extra time for more intensive revision. The class also felt fairly disorganized (there wasn't a syllabus) and I would have preferred a bit more information about what exactly we'd be assigned throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The instruction we receive from Professor zarin is excellent and very helpful. I do wish, however, that more regular in-depth feedback was a feature of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the structure, with readings being announced on a week to week basis rather than ahead of time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you get in, take it. Writing to word limit was a skill I didn't know I needed, and I'm really proud of the work that I/my classmates did this semester. The one-on-one peer editing workshops that I did for each essay I wrote were invaluable experiences.\r\n\r\nMy one caution would be to think twice about taking two creative writing workshops in one semester--although there are no longer rules about taking multiple creative writing classes in a single semester, taking this class and another advanced workshop at the same time (again, although I learned a lot) took its toll on my other coursework. ",
            "\u00a0I think it will be a good experience if you have things you want to write about and want to workshop them. One develops thick skin in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to anybody who's serious about nonfiction writing and wants to spend 2 hours each week talking about writing. CZ is a great professor and will make you rethink what an essay can be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with caveats. Pay attention to what people say about the strengths and weaknesses of the course. If you're in the class and it doesn't feel right for you, pay attention to that. But if you stick with it, you will without a doubt become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you like writing and have a lot to say. There are no essay prompts so you need to already have an interest in story telling/essay writing and a general idea for how to write a personal essay but if you do and you're interested in improving while also reading others' work then this course is great! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to do a lot of writing. Prof. Zarin assigned six essays, ranging from 400 words to 2500 words, which gave us a lot of opportunities to try our hand at essay-writing. But, on top of all the readings and critiques, it felt like a lot of work. That being said, the other people in the class were fantastic writers and gave great feedback during the workshops, and I found Prof. Zarin's thoughts and advice extremely helpful (both in class and during office hours). This class is a great way to improve your writing, but I'd only take it if you have the time to commit to the writing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely take this course if youre interested in improving your writing. You will get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I saw everyones writing improve greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take it. "
