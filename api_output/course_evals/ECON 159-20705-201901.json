            "\u00a0This is truly one of the worst courses I have ever taken in my now eight semesters at Yale. I wish there had been a textbook to learn from, as that would have been much more conducive to learning than going to lecture. While I appreciate Marina's obvious enthusiasm, passion, and knowledge of game theory, execution of this course was just not effective. The problem sets were generally long and tedious and had no real pedagogical value aside from rehashing the material from lecture, often in unhelpful and convoluted ways that focused more on algebraic or statistical creativity than anything else. The midterm was horrendous. The questions were poorly written and unclear. The grading was both sloppy and unforgiving. The final was no better. I have not up to this point gotten a letter grade below an A- in my 40 credits and eight semesters at Yale; this may be my first C, and not for lack of effort or preparation. In the middle of the semester after spring break, Marina informed the class that some students had been emailing her about the course curve and admitted that she had not been cognizant of the standard economics department curve but promised that she would announce how the curve would be soon before the final. Even after follow-up email inquiry, she never clarified her decision on the course curve. Perhaps worst of all was the extremely inefficient use of classtime in lecture. Marina would often spend up to 40 minutes per class answering student questions at every step of the lecture to the point that she did not have time to adequately cover some of the more difficult concepts (usually saved for the end of the lectures). While I appreciate her willingness to answer each and every question, it was extremely inefficient. Many of the questions were relatively simple, asking for clarification on some minor detail or another, but she ended up overexplaining everything in an extremely repetitive and unhelpful way such that she lost the attention of many students waiting for her to just move on to the next slide. Lectures quickly became exercises in the time-honored virtue of patience. While some may be put off by the overall negative tone of my evaluation, I do so in order to make clear the merits and demerits of this course to rational consumers who seek to make informed decisions about their course selections. Overall, this disaster of a course reflects a deep misunderstanding of basic pedagogy and time management. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: SO interesting, consistent application to real-world examples made content so engaging\r\nWeaknesses: none really ",

The material is not very hard, which is very encouraging for people who want to understand the concepts without having to rigorously prove them mathematically. However, personally, I probably would have enjoyed a more rigorous class. However, there is already a class that is more rigorous (Mathematical Game Theory), so I would not say that the improvement has to deal with this course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Halac is a wonderful teacher. She is clear, precise and patient with her explanations and makes it evident that she is invested in her students walking away with a strong grasp on the material and an excitement to learn. While this made the course in many ways worthwhile, the structure and nature of the exams was in many ways counterproductive to allowing all students the chance to grow and demonstrate competency with the material. The midterm was far more accessible than most Econ exams, but this made mistakes incredibly costly. With the problem sets graded on a check/check plus basis, it was nearly impossible after a mediocre midterm performance to even have a chance at getting an A range grade regardless of how well you did on the final. I hope Professor Halac accounts for this in her final exam review, and deviates from the Econ curve to create a more equitable scale. It's heartbreaking to walk out of a class feeling like you learned a lot about the material, but not have the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Marina's a great teacher, great lecture slides, good and useful content \r\nweakness: grade heavily dependent on midterm and final ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught and well organized. Problem set grading was a mess and inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well taught course. I do think that more psets would have been better. The practice psets were good, but it would have helped to have more required practice and feedback. That said, all of the problems were reasonable and well thought out. Professor Halac was very good at explaining things, and clearly cares a lot about student learning. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is the relative lack of practical applications. Although some were mentioned in class, a few case studies wouldnt hurt. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course was well organized in terms of lecture materials and chronology. The professor did well to introduce the topic through lecture notes and delve into the material through the example of games. Optional discussion sections and office hours gave students the opportunities to ask any questions or clarify the material of the class and on the problem sets. Problem sets were not returned in an efficient matter during class and homework grades were relatively unknown throughout the semester which need to be improved. I think that the exam questions were fair game compared to the problem sets and material from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Marina explains course content really well. She is really clear and very helpful by email as well. The class was overall good and not a heavy work load (just 4 psets and 2 tests). \r\n\r\nKey weakness that I hope is changed: problem sets are graded on a 3 point scale. IF they graded out of 10 it would be more fair to students. Sometimes one wrong part of a problems results in a 2 out of 3, which is concerning for grades. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is quite interesting and the lectures did a good job of explaining the material.  The problem sets (we only had 4 of them) took probably 4 hours and were pretty good for testing yourself.  The midterm/final weren't too difficult.  If I had a criticism, it's almost that we could have done more in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The optional problems and section were one of the greatest strengths of this course. Sometimes it was hard to completely follow along during lecture but the optional problems and section really helped solidify what was taught every week. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were all very clear and taught us what we needed to know for problem sets and exams. \r\nThe low number of problem sets sometimes made it so I neglected studying/working on game theory because of the long break until any due date. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the teaching and material. The weakness was the number of assignments ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was extremely well taught. The lectures were very clear and helpful to follow, and the material taught in class translated well into the problem sets and exams. I felt that the problem sets did a good job of summarizing the core concepts to takeaway from lecture, and were a fair workload balance. Further, the optional problems that Professor Halac provided helped fill in any gaps that I may have had and provided useful extra practice. ",
            "\u00a0More TA office hours, and the TAs did not actively help with problem sets ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class was very engaging, from in-class games to interesting historical applications of certain concepts. I also thought that the workload and test difficulty was very reasonable, and the class was focused on facilitating learning instead of obtaining certain grades. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was how engaged and passionate Professor Halac was about the subject, which showed through her well curated lectures and the interesting course material. The only weakness of the course is probably that there is immense pressure to do well on the one midterm and final, which account for almost all of your grade. If there were two midterms, or more psets throughout the semester, this stress could be alleviated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: MARINA- literally one of the best professors out there she was amazing love her\r\nWeaknesses: Discrepancy between class material and p sets. The class examples were really easy but the p sets ridiculously hard. PLEASE add some sort of bridge between these two. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely useful information that one can apply in so many ways\r\nWeaknesses: the problem sets and final exam were very hard because it wasnt obvious how the theory and equations and solving we learned in class applied outside of those situations ",
            "\u00a0It is strong in that the course material is interesting and Professor Halac made lectures very engaging and relatively hands-on.\r\n\r\nThe strengths outweighed the weaknesses, but I will go into detail on weaknesses. Its weaknesses are in the fact that the course material can sometimes be a little slow despite being interesting in theory. But far more importantly, there was essentially zero feedback on student performance throughout the semester. There were only four problem sets the entire semester, and they were essentially not graded (only on a check minus, check, check plus scale) and even the posted solutions were cursory and did not have sufficiently detailed ways to solve the problems. The single midterm exam was very late in the semester and was not graded until after the midterm drop deadline, so there were quite literally no grades in Canvas before the drop deadline. The exam turned out to be (empirically) skewed upwards as the mode was a 100%, and it was very unclear how the professor would choose to curve grades. The final exam was similar except for the fact that it had one question that was harder than the others, and I expect that it made the exam bimodal (though this is an assumption because final exam grades were not even posted before official final grades were posted). This was the main problem with the class  it was essentially impossible for a student to know how they were doing or how prepared they were for exams or the course as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0-More detailed notes.\r\n-More practice problems closer to what we saw during the exams. \r\n-More step by step solutions of key concepts. I had many questions and was very uncertain about many of the aspects of some of the exercises. Especially for the signaling games, were many things were left to be figured out entirely by the students. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Halac was a terrific lecturer who was always enthusiastic about course material. I did think, however, the exams were too easy so the curve did not work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material is pretty interesting \r\nWeaknesses: It started to move very fast after the midterm and I got so lost so quickly. The lectures were helpful but difficult to follow because many steps of the how to solve the problem would be skipped and we'd just be shown the answer. The psets did not reflect what we learned in class and was much harder than expected. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course were, no doubt, the applications and games played in class. They made the lectures, which could sometimes feel a bit heavy, much more lively and kept us all interested. A weakness was the weight attached to the midterm and final, which accounted for too large a percentage of the grade. There could also have been more psets. ",
            "\u00a0Very structured class, maybe a little too much information to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course is set up well. I would not force students to sign up for non-obligatory sections, although, the sections I did attend, were helpful. Perhaps even making it a requirement would be useful. ",

We only had six assignments over the course of the semester (four problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam), and so our final grade was determined by a small amount of work. Additionally, the way that the assignments were graded left little room for mistakes. The graders do not seem to understand the concept of partial credit at all, grading answers that were slightly wrong the same way they would grade blank ones. It is not fair to treat those who attempted a response and maybe missed some part of it the same way you would treat someone who didn't even attempt the question. Thus, I do not feel like my final grade will truly represent all that I learned in the course. I wish we had more assignments out of more points so that we could constantly be tested and held accountable for the material throughout the semester. That way, if you don't understand a topic, you can learn from your mistakes instead of being discouraged and punished. ",

",
            "\u00a0Yes, marina's a great teacher and it's very interesting content ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A super interesting class that was well organized and manageable workload! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if it's needed for/applicable to your major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. However, people with a strong background in game theory may want to think about skipping it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, due to its capacity to bring rationality to emotional situations in which one has to make choices. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that this was a very interesting course that allowed you to use logic in order to solve problems with applications of which could be applied to real-world scenarios. It was a low workload with only four problem sets, optional problems each week, and optional sections. You only had to study for the midterm and the final exams which were each three questions related to the lecture and problem set material. I think that the concepts and examples of games during class would influence one's thinking and rationality in decision-making going forward in life. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very chill, especially compared to the more intense game theory class.  I had a good time it and as a non-econ major found it quite relevant to the kind of thinking that will help me regardless of my career path.  It's a good SO and the math isn't very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any economics major. It serves as an introduction to an important branch in the field. It also has many applications to places beyond just economics, such as psychology, industrial organization, and global affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great introduction to a fascinating topic and was structured very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a must in the Econ department. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in game theory and is looking for a solid base in the material. Professor Halac is an extremely fantastic professor and is someone who can convey the material (even if it is slightly more complex) in terms that are very easy to understand. The assessments were fair and there were a lot of resource beyond the problem sets to help you grasp the material if needed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, really interesting material ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would recommend this class to another student. I think that this class is accessible to students from a wide range of backgrounds - economics, mathematics, those interested in logic, cognitive science, etc. I also think that the course is taught very well, and the subject matter is very interesting and useful outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would if you are looking for an interesting econ elective that has applications to almost all areas of academia, including politics and international affairs. It is not too much of a weekly workload, and it is worth it just to get to know Professor Halac. ",
            "\u00a0Yesthe workload was appropriate, less than most of my other classes. But, while the work wasnt a ton, the class is still very hard. Please keep that in mind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is a very useful course for anyone entering econ, polisci, or another social science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is very little work and is interesting. However, expect to have exactly zero feedback on your performance  you won't even see your grades until it is too late. ",
            "\u00a0If the professor made some adjustments as to how she teaches certain concepts I would highly recommend this course. The notes need to be more well defined and more exercises should be done within the boundaries of the classroom, and not left as purely practice problems to the students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because we covered a lot of ground and it was a blast. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend as Credit/D or only for econ major students. The class was really hard for me to understand and the curve, especially for the midterm, was awful. If your thinking that this is a gutty class, it really is not. The psets were not reflective of what we learned in class and the exams were pretty hard. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody who has an interest in game theory. The course is eye-opening and will change how you approach conflict and decision making. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really interesting course if you are an analytical-type person, I liked it a lot and other people did as well. It has a bit of a reputation for being a gut - in terms of workload it definitely is, but if you don't go to class you might get caught off guard on the exam, so make sure you don't take it too lightly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I definitely recommend this to anyone potentially interested in economics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was simply a fun class, that led to interesting insights about our decision making and optimal decisions in tricky situations. A wide background of student interests stand to benefit from this class, from political science to neuroscience to sociology. Wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0This is truly one of the worst courses I have ever taken in my now eight semesters at Yale. I wish there had been a textbook to learn from, as that would have been much more conducive to learning than going to lecture. While I appreciate Marina's obvious enthusiasm, passion, and knowledge of game theory, execution of this course was just not effective. The problem sets were generally long and tedious and had no real pedagogical value aside from rehashing the material from lecture, often in unhelpful and convoluted ways that focused more on algebraic or statistical creativity than anything else. The midterm was horrendous. The questions were poorly written and unclear. The grading was both sloppy and unforgiving. The final was no better. I have not up to this point gotten a letter grade below an A- in my 40 credits and eight semesters at Yale; this may be my first C, and not for lack of effort or preparation. In the middle of the semester after spring break, Marina informed the class that some students had been emailing her about the course curve and admitted that she had not been cognizant of the standard economics department curve but promised that she would announce how the curve would be soon before the final. Even after follow-up email inquiry, she never clarified her decision on the course curve. Perhaps worst of all was the extremely inefficient use of classtime in lecture. Marina would often spend up to 40 minutes per class answering student questions at every step of the lecture to the point that she did not have time to adequately cover some of the more difficult concepts (usually saved for the end of the lectures). While I appreciate her willingness to answer each and every question, it was extremely inefficient. Many of the questions were relatively simple, asking for clarification on some minor detail or another, but she ended up overexplaining everything in an extremely repetitive and unhelpful way such that she lost the attention of many students waiting for her to just move on to the next slide. Lectures quickly became exercises in the time-honored virtue of patience. While some may be put off by the overall negative tone of my evaluation, I do so in order to make clear the merits and demerits of this course to rational consumers who seek to make informed decisions about their course selections. Overall, this disaster of a course reflects a deep misunderstanding of basic pedagogy and time management. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. First of all, Game Theory in and of itself is just a fascinating subject. Marina does a good job of showing the applicability of various strategies through her in-class games and demonstrations. Second, the class is very fair. The more you put in, the more you you get out. Your grade will reflect this. But I will say again: the class is very fair. Take Game Theory. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, its a good game theory class, you'll learn the basics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Halac was amazing, as were the TFs ",
            "\u00a0yes - very good for econ majors and anyone interesting in quant courses ",
            "\u00a0I've heard mixed things about the class across semesters, but my experience  with this professor was very good. I would recommend checking who's teaching the class and going with a professor that you like, because this has the potential to be a great course when taught well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if it is taught by Professor Halac. She is incredibly intelligent and a wonderful teacher. You will learn a lot and leave the class feeling very accomplished and satisfied. ",
            "\u00a0It is very hard, you have to pay attention and understand each step of the info or else you'll stumble. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very interesting course and an interesting take on rationality and human interaction. But at the same time, it's like many econ courses where there are many assumptions that go into solving a given problem, and the course doesn't go deep into the real theoretical basis of the problems. ",
            "\u00a0yep. Super interesting topic if you're a logical thinker. Not too hard. Excellent professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student with a deep and well-rooted understanding of economics and/or mathematics. It can be a fun addition and feels very applicable to human behavior. The tests and quizzes stretch your knowledge-- they're not just things you learn in class. it is important to do all of the optional problems and go to section; if you are committed, you will get a lot out of this class.
