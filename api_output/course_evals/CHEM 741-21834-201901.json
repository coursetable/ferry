            "\u00a0The main issue of this chemical biology seminar is that a lot of the times the broadcasting system was not working properly, which is very very unfair for students working on west campus. For example, the talk given by Hiroaki Suga, the broadcast system had only sounds but no image at all. Though we complained to the chemistry office about this but still, nothing has changed. Also in many occasions, the chemistry office is sending email saying nobody wants to have lunch with the speaker, while more than half of the chem bio students are working on west campus. I'm wondering if it's possible to simply bring those chemical biology related speakers to come to west campus, giving a talk and having lunch with the students there. ",
