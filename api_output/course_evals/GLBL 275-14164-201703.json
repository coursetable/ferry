            "\u00a0Different approaches to international relations were assessed and research design was discussed. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an in-depth understanding on various aspects of international security scholarship. The class explored both the theoretical and empirical foundations of the subject. I have become a much better writer and reader from taking this course, and am able to critique scholarly works while marshaling evidence for my own arguments. This class has also confirmed my passion for Global Affairs as a discipline, and consistently gave me new insights on the world's most pressing problems. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a comprehensive overview of different problems affecting international security and different theories as to how they can be resolved or mitigated. I learned a great deal about war in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as well as modern US foreign policy regarding the Middle East, Russia, China, and North Korea. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of theories and frameworks for evaluating international security issues today and in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much broader awareness of the theoretical debates within international security. I enjoyed the use to history to teach the theoretical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned fundamental IR concepts and historical background that shape today's international strategy. I was exposed to key works in the field and learned greatly on various topics covered by international security that I was not aware of before. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned the basics to international security, from its theoretical and philosophical foundations, to emerging research and challenges in international security. I've learned how to evaluate the validity of research papers on the subject, and how to approach my own thinking on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about security theory and past/current application of those theories. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of international politics, security, and the underlying theories and pressing issues within the field. ",
            "\u00a0Broad knowledge about the field of international security. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of what drives questions of international security and a balanced exposure to the diverse opinions that exist in terms of why we fight and what we can do to lessen international conflict. As a dev major, I feel quite a lot more literate in the topic of international security and the trials and tribulations associated with living within an anarchic international system. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep understanding of the factors shaping international security, as well as a framework through which to view issues of national security and security strategy. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty solid understanding of the key literature and concepts surrounding debates in international security and their corresponding criticisms ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a broad range of fundamental theories and scholarship across various topics in the field of international security. I also learned to think about the methodology of international security research. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the main theories of international relations (liberalism, realism, and constructivism), along with a number of case studies exemplifying or disproving those theories. We also learned about how recent developments like the spread of terrorism and nuclear weapons have impacted and reshaped the international system. ",
            "\u00a0I initially took this course as a seminar last semester but dropped it due to scheduling conflicts. The lecture format is much better because it allows us to come into discussions with a strong foundational understanding of the material and helps to synthesize readings along common points. I learned a lot about security and political machinations from this class. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly learned about international security theory and how history and theory interact. I also learned how to apply theory to current events and how a mixture of history, theory, and quantitive studies needs to be considered with making security policy decisions. "

            "\u00a0Less readings assigned to more realistically address what is needed for lecture. Lecture summed up readings, so it wasn't necessary to do both aspects if need be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredible professor, unique format, engaging discussion section, easily-accessible materials on Canvas.\r\nWeaknesses: The rules about writing papers seemed oddly strict and were confusing to understand at first - particularly how the due dates listed on the syllabus were not the actual due dates. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of the course are the quality of the selected readings and the engagement Professor Monteiro has with the class. He is simply one of the best professors I have had at Yale, able to clearly and comprehensively discuss the topic for each class while keeping the students' attention with fascinating details and humorous anecdotes. The one aspect of the class that could be improved is section, which was often a bit unfocused and wasn't always relevant to the topics discussed in lecture. However, the sections were interesting because they were an opportunity to pick Professor Monteiro's brain about current events. ",
            "\u00a0The sections with Professor Monteiro were awesome. The lectures were great, too. There wasn't a lot of incentive to do all of the readings - that is something Professor Monteiro should think about if he wants people to actually consistently do them. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in this course were amazing. The historical examples, humor, and simplification of complex theories made it one of my favorite classes. However, most of the readings were extremely dry. I understand they are necessary, but that is my only complaint. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great introduction to the field of international security, and I feel like I came out with a solid background on which I can proceed with more in-depth studies in the field. The course was sometimes rather fast-paced, but was understandable since there is indeed much to cover and the the powerpoint slides were uploaded. I think the discussion sessions can be improved, however, which I will discuss in the question below. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the set-up of the lecture paired with the discussion section. Occasionally, I think there is a problem with certain students dominating conversations and promoting cyclical discussions that aren't as engaging. Also, I would have liked for the course material to have been published online so that anyone could have gone back and reviewed the lectures as well. ",
            "\u00a0The grading scheme of three response papers and a final exam is great. The fact that Prof. Monteiro led sections himself made the class much more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was executed well--we learned different modules and concepts of international security each week, and then had discussion sections to discuss it. I appreciated the lectures as a means of really absorbing and learning the foundations of international security, especially as I did not have a firm foundation of it before this course. Sections were helpful in discussing the arguments made in the readings, and their merits. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Monteiro is a wonderful lecturer -- every class was clear and engaging, making course time enjoyable! On top of that, I loved that he also served as the discussion leader during section as it gave us a chance to ask him questions (although it then sometimes felt like it was more a q and a time than student discussion). I loved that he often apply the theory with real world examples -- it was very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the readings could be a bit better curated, some felt too long and unnecessary. Additionally, it felt like there was a little bit too much attention on research theory/discussion (RCT vs. history, etc.) -- it was interesting for one conversation, but felt like it kept coming up. Didn't love the 3 response paper --> it sometimes feels arbitrary to critique papers when you might agree with most and you're not allowed to do a lot of outside research (meaning you write a poorly back up paper critiquing some of the most famous political scientists ever). ",
            "\u00a0This is a strong course that covers the fundamentals. More discussion of contemporary great power politics and issues (such as the lecture on China, which was excellent) could be of interest. Also, possibly incorporating outside lecturers into course material could be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Having sections with Prof. Monteiro was great.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear what the TFs were looking for with the response papers. It would have been good for the assignment to have been more clearly defined. ",
            "\u00a0The material is extremely interesting. Necessarily, however, breadth comes at the expense of depth. The reading responses were rather arbitrary and didn't really reward deep engagement with the material as much as they looked for structurally well-written papers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Monteiro was the perfect person to take on the incredible challenge of teaching a Security course to a room split between Security and Dev GA students. As a Dev major, I really liked the survey nature of the course and feel like I cam away with a lot of insight. I can't speak for Security majors, but they may have felt the coursework was a bit redundant in terms of their previous experience. Having Monteiro lead each section was absolutely invaluable to the experience and I do hope that this is something future Global cohorts will be able take advantage of. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class. Sec Core has historically been a very poorly taught class and one of the worst classes in the global major. Prof. Monteiro absolutely turned this around. This class was interesting, enjoyable, and the best class I have taken this year and possibly in the entire global major. The strength of this class is Prof. Monteiro. He understands issues more thoroughly than any other person I've met and is excellent at connecting the dots of state security. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was organized pretty well! The readings were interesting, although game-theory level heavy and I think they could have been shortened and we could have reached the same conclusions/learned the same amount. The lectures were really interesting, and I rarely felt bored in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: covers many topics and theories within international security, sections led by professor which kept the class cohesive and manageable and really improved learning and understanding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes difficult to connect readings to lectures and to remember which scholar said what; also minimal guidance on papers ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! The readings were engaging, lectures were interesting, and section was helpful and thought-provoking. I really can't think of many ways it could be improved--it was great! ",
            "\u00a0I much prefer the lecture style and having Nuno lead the sections, while a big time commitment from him, was very helpful. This way we are all on the same page about what the subject of the lecture was and can analyze the readings within that context, rather than merely summarize as usually happens with a TF. The problem with this system is that the TFs had very little engagement with students aside from grading, and I found my TF didn't want to discuss my final paper topic with me and was very hard to reach. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course were fantastic. Professor Monteiro is incredibly engaging and clear as a lecturer. I also really enjoyed having Professor Monteiro lead each section because it allowed students to discuss the material of the class in a much smaller setting with the professor. I liked the assignment structure of the class (three short papers that could be handed in during flexible periods throughout the semester and one final paper), but I could understand why the structure would kind of promote students focusing on the readings only for certain weeks and not thoroughly doing the readings other weeks. "

            "\u00a0The professor really knows his subject material and is a great lecturer. The class itself is very interesting in terms of content, very useful for understanding the differing styles of study in academia of international security. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to global and non-global majors alike. it is an amazing course and Professor Monteiro is fantastic ",
            "\u00a0It is a requirement for Global Affairs majors. It is a great course to provide you a more in-depth understanding of international security. Take it as a junior, not a senior so that you'll have time to apply what you learn in this class to your upper-level seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student at Yale. The topic should be interesting to almost everyone. Those who aren't interested in the topic should still learn something about it so that they will be able to properly fulfill their civic duty and vote for candidates with the best foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class has gotten bad reviews in the past, but I think people this semester generally enjoyed it! Professor Monteiro made it interesting and well-organized. I genuinely looked forward to class and section every week. ",
            "\u00a0I have recommended this class to other students, including non Global majors. I think it is the type of class that people imagine when they think of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to international security. It will not be an in-depth discussion on one topic but rather a sampling of the theories that constitute the field and prominent historical events that shape today's international security. With that said, it does provide students with great background and a survey understanding of the field that can be very useful for future studies on more specific topics. ",
            "\u00a0This was definitely the most interesting class I took this semester, as I think the focus was primarily just on learning and absorbing material without the pressure of regurgitating it later- the work wasn't overly much and didn't require knowledge of the lecture to do well. Overall, you learn most from this class showing up ready to learn and prepared to engage. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great overview of international security topics. Particularly interesting for people with no background on the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students as a good 101 course on international security. Professor Monteiro is a great professor who knows a lot about international security, and the current discourse and scholarship surrounding the topic, and shares that with the class. The workload is manageable, and there's a good mix of topics and assignments in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I was a little nervous going in as Global core courses have been criticized in the past, but Professor Monteiro is a phenomenal, incredibly intelligent lecturer that clearly explains the material and makes it interesting! Readings are a little boring, but lecture is great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Aside from being required for Global Affairs majors, GLBL 275 as taught by Nuno Monteiro is an incredible introductory course in international relations theory. Professor Monteiro oozes charm, warmth, and utter brilliance; his ability to root lessons, contemporary issues, and student questions in scholarship and IR theory serves to provide a remarkable insight into the field, and to give students an example of what a true political scientist/historian is. \r\n\r\nI'd recommend taking this, or any course with Prof. Monteiro, even if you are not a GLBL major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Monteiro is amazingly fun and knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class and Nuno Monteiro is an outstanding professor. For anyone interested in these topics this would be a great course to learn the fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Monteiro is brilliant and the material fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0The only people really able to take this course are Global majors (capped at 54 people, I believe), but I would truly recommend this course to anyone looking for a survey course on international security perspectives and theory! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in understanding the basics of international security, whether at the interstate, intrastate or nonstate level. I would recommend this course even to non-global majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably only take this class if it was required (and it is for Global Affairs majors), but I'm glad I took it and I think I got a good amount out of it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class because it provides an important foundation in the scholarship of international security, both older fundamental work and new research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really went into this course expecting it to be a bit of a slog, but this ended up being one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale! Professor Monteiro is such a great lecturer, and he makes the material not only understandable, but super interesting. You'll learn to think about international relations (and social science in general) in a completely new way, and you'll be engaged as you do it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for Global majors, but I found Nuno's lectures so compelling that I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in international security. ",
            "\u00a0While this course is definitely aimed towards Global Affairs majors who are required to take this class, anyone interested in international security would definitely enjoy the lectures and get a good amount out of the weekly discussion sections. "
