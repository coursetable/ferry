            "\u00a0Great insight into medical school and the topics one will learn. Was great to have a variety of topics to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Good, but definitely not great, introductory course to the biology of different diseases. Course varies significantly by instructor and most are not the best lecturers. Having said that, manageable workload and feasible to do well in ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about pathology, in a somewhat haphazard fashion. Cancer and heme were the best units, and I came away feeling really solid about those systems/disease models. GI was also really solid, especially since I didn't even have a good sense of the gross anatomy before. ",
            "\u00a0How various diseases arise, the ins and outs of different body systems and what can go wrong in them ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the body's response to injury in several organ systems and about the different illnesses and conditions that may arise in this response. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of what goes wrong on a cellular or tissue level in three tissue types, and an overview of how cancer functions. I learned a few pathways by which cell functions can fail, and integrated them with physical presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what it felt like to be a med student. I learned how to think about physiological systems in the context of things going wrong. I also learned how to cram information in my head in the most efficient way possible. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Sometimes the material was quite rushed as you had to get through so much in only 2 weeks. This meant that some of the learning was centred around the exams as opposed to just the material. Also because you're moving through different topics so quickly, and with different professors, you rarely get good feedback as the next professor may be looking for something completely different in his or her exam. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good overall, just variable lecture quality by professor. Seemed like some didn't really want to be there ",
            "\u00a0I think Hudnall should write all of the exams with input from the professors of each unit and the TAs. Also, someone (anyone) needs to be at every lecture to be able to provide some sort of continuity. We would regularly look around and see no TAs, which made asking them questions about the erratic exams difficult. It's impossible to get better at the class because you switch teachers every three weeks and each exam is very different - that's a real weakness. The exams varied wildly and the very giving of them was disorganized (one time they ran out of paper, and they had literally been using loose leaf printer paper to begin with). \r\n\r\nThat being said, I learned a great deal and think that the format replicates medical school environments more closely than other classes. The material would easily have built on itself, but the later professors seemed to have little idea what the earlier teachers had said and would repeat basic things like the Hayflick Limit or what an eosinophil does. Again, continuity or sharing material or constructing some sort of guided syllabus would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Some exams were unclearly written, it might be helpful to standardize a format for questions ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the faculty that teaches the course, and the format of five non cumulative exams. This allows students to learn from a field expert and focus only on one material at a time instead of having to cover alot of topics for tests. ",
            "\u00a0The class is disjointed across the five professors. It can be jarring, to switch lecture styles every few weeks, though it is nice to hear from professionals. The worst part about the class is that each professor writes a test in a unique style, and some professors wrote much better tests than others. In a perfect world, the course director might write the exams for all of the professors, though it might be harder for the test to examine as specific knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt does give a good overview of each section, and the professors are all very knowledgeable about their subject. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting material, professors seemed to genuinely love their field \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: had to adjust to 5 different teaching styles, a lot of information to memorize ",
            "\u00a0Though I appreciated the diversity in the material and instructors, the teaching style and level of difficulty of the exams of each unit was just way too different. While some professors went way too much in depth and got caught up with listing all the diseases that could possibly be associated with the field of study, other professors only briefly touched upon the subject. It would've been nice to have more collaboration and uniformity between the teaching staff. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that various professors were brought in to teach their specialties, and that they were all available and willing for questions. However, Piazza questions were not answered. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes but you've really got to keep on top of the work. Topics are very interesting but as you're tested to frequently you need to keep on top of it. Can be difficult as different professors have different styles of both teaching and testing. ",
            "\u00a0Good, but definitely not great, introductory course to the biology of different diseases. Course varies significantly by instructor and most are not the best lecturers. Having said that, manageable workload and feasible to do well in ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, all in all it's a good class. It's very little work because the exams are only on two weeks of material each. I took it senior spring and didn't need to take the fifth exam, which was great. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in medicine but your classes have been mostly based on basic science, you might find this class a lot more interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course, but dangerous if (A) youre not an exam person (thats the only component of your grade) and/or (B) you have trouble switching between different teaching styles. Exams every two weeks is a lot, so know what youre getting into! ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. Pre meds should definitely take it, and MCDB majors interested in medicine should as well. ",
            "\u00a0The class is fine; if you want to learn about physiological systems (take 310!), you'll learn more organ functionality than in most other MCDB classes. It also introduces you to diseases in a way that you wouldn't hear until medical school. Still, since there isn't enough time to do a lot of background, each of the disease states you learn about has a tendency to feel isolated, and just like it's something to memorize, rather than being well connected to each other topic in the course. The best lectures are in hematology and cancer - take it if you want to learn about those. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to another student. Just be prepared to memorise a lot of information every two weeks, because there are FIVE midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Cool class. Tests ever two weeks and each tests covers A LOT of material so be ready to essentially study for a midterm every 2 weeks but you will learn a lot and its a cool survey into a lot of different areas. Just don't be surprised by how frequently you're cramming to study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes great course ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course, mostly because I loved the material. Would definitely recommend for students interested in medicine, or even just pathological processes in the body. "
