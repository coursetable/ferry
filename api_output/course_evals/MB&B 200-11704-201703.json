However, I wish that the problem sets were more emphasized so that we would do them and keep up.\r\n\r\nOne thing about this course I didn't like is the emphasis on net reactions. I feel like this is only memorization which I would otherwise look up in the real world. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it was extremely interesting material. However, the first part of the course was very different from the second half of the course (metabolism) and there was a steep learning curve adjustment midway through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the set up is 4 midterms each 25% of the grade which is a good way to keep up with the information and not fall behind and all there is no final, which is good because there is too much information learned to be able to memorize for a final. The class is also taught relatively well and it is easy to understand the material if you take the time to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0THIS HAS BEEN IN THE COMMENTS FOR AS LONG AS THIS COURSE HAS BEEN TAUGHT SO PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION.\r\n\r\nWe spent too much time on the basic, review concepts at the beginning and rush through metabolism at the end. Please, condense the early material and shift 2-4 more lectures to metabolism. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: No psets, sections are optional, 4 non-cumulative midterm check ins throughout the semester, no final!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 different instructors, 3 VERY different teaching styles, 3 different expectations for performance on the assessments ",
            "\u00a0Having the entire grade based solely on the exams can work for some people, but it didn't end up working for me. I wasn't motivated to study the material outside of class because there weren't any assignments due and section wasn't even mandatory. I wasn't motivated to do the psets because they weren't graded. The psets were also made by Professor Clay, so the other professors didn't really emphasize them. Maybe the course could have a small percentage of the grade based on the psets, or on quizzes that are given every week or every other week. It can be a small one question quiz, just something to keep the material fresh in our minds. Maybe I should have taken the MBB 300 class instead, since the format there is different, but I really liked that this class was a smaller size. I don't know if this can be fixed, but having multiple professors was one of the negative aspects of the class because the quality of instruction varied greatly. This could just be me, but I get accustomed to a professor's teaching style and exam style, and switching it up was a shock, especially towards the end. The expectations for each exam varied because of the different professors, and it was somewhat difficult to adjust. ",
            "\u00a0The test difficulties varied hugely. ",
            "\u00a0I think that grading the psets as homework would have been more helpful than just quickly skimming the answers in section. Section in general could have been more helpful, but when we started focusing on the psets it became a waste of time because the answers were rushed, unclear, and not discussed so we didn't even get what we were supposed to out of the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the material is pretty challenging. The greatest strength of the course is the structure. Four noncumulative exams was great - it would have been very difficult to know all of the material for a final. The professors do their best to put what they think is necessary on the slides which is good but in my opinion not really enough. In order to facilitate student learning, the professors need to slow down, otherwise students don't really get anything. It would be way way way better if the professors would write on the boards instead of presenting with slides and slides only to be used as supplemental material. The professors can speak much faster than anybody can write or even type. During the lectures (mostly Clay's lectures, not so much Breaker's lectures) it's very difficult to get anything. I did all of my learning outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0There is a definite shift in the sheer amount and style of material we are expected to know across the first and second half of the course. Also, the second half of the course material struck me as unreasonably difficult and intensive for an intro biochem class, and the teacher seemed to take pleasure in our distress and confusion with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Ron Breaker\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: spend less time in stuff at beginning and give Nicole Clay more time to do her more difficult material . . . the first 3 lectures could be done in 1 day... a lot of it is basic bio review ",
            "\u00a0The changing of professors was in some ways a weakness of the course because it was hard to learn what was expected of us in terms of assessments with each change in professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is very broad, and you really learn a TON about biochemistry in a way that feels pretty thorough, despite its broadness. Overall, the professors were a lot better than my BIOL 102/103 professors (much better at explaining concepts). It's pretty well-organized, with TAs and peer tutors (the peer tutors are AMAZING).  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course pacing is weird. The first half feels hard, but the second half really hits you and makes the first half seem easy. I feel like more time can be devoted to the second half and less to the first half. It seems like the first half is dragged out because Prof Engelmann just needs to get in his teaching requirement (4 lectures? Really?). ",
            "\u00a0For me a strength was the shorter, more frequent class times, though sometimes having a 9:25 on Friday isnt fun. Weaknesses is that the professors change mid-way through and so does the style of the tests ",
            "\u00a0There was little continuity between the three professors which made learning difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses were definitely no problem sets that were required. Having one test every 4 weeks made it easy to not do any work until studying right before it so it was hard to tell if we were grasping the material properly. Also, it was really confusing material at the end and I thought it was definitely glossed over quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included very helpful TAs. Weaknesses included the overload of information and detail that was interesting but unnecessary to know when it came to exams. The latter only occurred when professors switched at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course had a lot of strengths!  I think some of my classmates were frustrated with the changing of professors, but I thought each professor brought something unique to the course, which I really appreciated.  I wonder if the course might be improved by making discussion section more formalized (ie., having sections assigned at the beginning of the semester through preference selection, and having section attendance worth ~5% of the grade). ",
            "\u00a0Cool Clay lectures. Others were kinda boring. ",
            "\u00a0Too much content too quickly \r\nShould be blackboard instruction so the profs can't flip through 60 slides in one day with no regard for student learning speed ",
            "\u00a0I liked having 4 distinct sections of the course. It allowed for the material to be better digested by allowing for the focusing on a specific part of biochemistry at a time. ",
            "\u00a0The 4 exams were a weakness, the course could benefit from having other forms of assessments (quizzes, problem sets, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This course's biggest weakness is the way that it is structured. The second half of the class is exponentially more difficult than the first half, covering what felt like 10 times the material in the same amount of time. It would be much more beneficial if the time was better divided, making sure that the harder material towards the end got the time it deserved. The second half was also poorly-taught, which helped make it even more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that I learned a lot taking it and that it was geared towards the biochemistry tested on the MCAT, which is very important. A weakness was that there was no consistency between the three instructors and the amount of material Clay presented us with was so much more than the other two instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Grade transparency! And curved down first test. ",
            "\u00a0This course moved a bit too fast at times for the density of the material, although this is hard to avoid with the nature of the material. ",
            "\u00a0All the professors are highly knowledgeable and can teach well. The weakness of the course is that there is so much material to cover that sometimes material is skipped/taught so fast that it is difficult to absorb. ",
            "\u00a0The three professors who taught this course had very different teaching styles and did not seem to communicate or work together in any appreciable way.  It was difficult to adjust to their teaching and testing styles on such short intervals of time.  More consistency between them would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: clear lectures. Weakness: poor organization and lacking TA staff. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and the instructors had a very clear plan on the syllabus from the start. However, the level of difficulty  of the exams varies a lot from instructor to instructor and they have completely different styles, which I found to be negative. "

            "\u00a0This course was great. I did not really learn a lot about biochemistry, but I did learn that when I am getting pegged it is advisable to use a lot of lube. And boy was there pegging. My erotic relationship with this course started off pretty chill, both Breaker and Engleman weren't really interested in me and I wasn't really interested in them. The exams were fair, albeit on the easy side. Then Nicole came; and oh, was that fun. Underneath her nerdy demeanor lays a very unconventional nature; her first exam made me scream (\"like a virgin, touched for the very first time\"). It was that bad; but at least everyone felt like that. The second Clay exam was more like Madonna when she was 55 (completely unpleasant, but less so). All in all, a decent course; probably better than MB&B. I recommend a water-based lube as your tears (and the showers you will take after the exams 'cause you feel badly) will wash it off. Easy A. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0I just needed to know the bare minimum for the MCAT and wasn't too interested in biochemistry, so I think this course did the job. If you're super into biochem, maybe consider taking the MBB version. If not, MCDB biochem is a supposed to be easier, and the professors are not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they have to take it for a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, Ron Breaker is great, but if you want a biochem course, I would recommend taking the MB&B one. Most of the stuff that's important for the MCAT, medical school, further coursework, etc. was taught by Nicole Clay, and her lecturing was very disorganized. For reference, I took an MCAT practice exam a few days after finishing this class and scored lowest in the biochemistry section. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're taking this course it's probably a requirement. Buckle down and keep up with the lectures, and you should get through just fine. ",
            "\u00a0I preferred the MCDB version of biochem opposed to the MB&B version as I didn't want to take a cumulative final in a biochemistry class. However, MCDB biochem was still fairly difficult and it requires you to stay familiar with the material throughout the whole semester. The difficulty of the exams increase with each exam so definitely pay attention in class and do the readings. DONT FALL BEHIND. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good biochem class when taking into consideration that it will be very dense information and a lot to learn, but if you go to class and read the textbook the midterms are all not painful. It is a lot of information and you have to go to class to learn it all and pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0Ultimately, yes. If you're a premed studying for the MCAT, this course covers more topics and not as in much depth-- perfect for the MCAT. There is a smaller workload. There are no problem sets that are actually due (there are optional ones that you don't turn in). There is no final. Midterms are non-cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't shop the other biochem class (MBB 300) but I have friends who took it this semester. From what I've heard, that class is better taught than this one, so I recommend you shop both.Ultimately you're taking this because you have to, so it's a matter of picking the class that's less torturous for you. This class has less people than the other one, which is something I liked. The grade is based solely on 4 midterms (25% each), which are not cumulative, and there is no final during finals week. This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you study. For me it turned out to be disastrous because I wasn't motivated to study until right before the exams, since there weren't any assignments due (there were psets but not graded) and section wasn't mandatory. In my opinion, the quality of the class decreases (and the difficulty of the material increases) when Professor Breaker's lectures are over. ",
            "\u00a0You kind of have to take it, so... Idk. MB&B Biochem might be your cup of tea if you prefer a more structured class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class over MBB300 if you're premed for a few reasons. One, this class is designed to be a one semester comprehensive overview of biochem, while MBB is part of a two semester series. This means that while MBB may go more in depth with the material, MCDB covers more overall. Second, there is NO CUMULATIVE FINAL in this class. This is huge given the amount of material presented in the course. Instead there are four midterms. This year there were no psets either, so the workload was very manageable. The class was interesting, but really keep on top of the material especially when you start metabolism and exam 3. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to people who have to take a biochemistry course. If you don't have to take a biochemistry course, I definitely wouldn't take this for fun or even as a core MCDB course. However, I did really like the structure of the course (four noncumulative exams and no final). I'm glad I took this over the MBB biochem! \r\nI honestly studied for some of the exams more than I've studied for any other final though. You're really held to incredibly high standards for the quantity of material you need to know. Just be aware when taking the course that this will consume a lot of your time, especially because you're almost always studying for an exam. ",
            "\u00a0I was drawn to this course because there weren't any cumulative midterms or finals, but you should know that the first portion of this class definitely lulls you into thinking it will be easier than it is. The first quarter is great, the second is significantly harder, and the third and fourth are brutal (a girl cried during the third midterm last year, which the teacher seemed to think was amusing). The sheer amount of information you have to learn in order to even understand the questions being asked is intense, and you must be prepared to study well ahead of time and learn mechanisms and pathways/reactions like the back of your hand. If you are someone that tends to cram or wont have the time to go to all the dicussion sections made available, you will not do well in this class. You should also be aware that the class is curved to a B+, so only about the top 25% of students can even think about getting something higher (although it is a resonable for people below the median, etc.). I spoke with someone in the other biochem class, and they don't learn the material to the same detail that we have to - I would suggest you take that class, as the non-cumulative deal does not make this class worth it. ",
            "\u00a0NO WAY JOSE! Unless you're God awful at taking finals, just do the MB&B Biochem class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely one of the more interesting pre med requirements that is far more manageable than orgo. Having no problem sets is nice, but it requires you to really keep up with the material (if you're bad at that, probably don't take this class). 4 exams (each 25%, not cumulative) do involve a few long nights before them. NO FINAL is a blessing!! Profs are good - Breaker is one of my favorite lecturers ever, Engelmann barely exists (he does OK), Clay is hard and kind of harsh but still a good lecturer (would be perfect if at 0.75x speed, but she's also tasked with the most material). Second half is much much harder than first half, so don't get too comfortable. It's also really nice to see how biochem connects explicitly to medicine. Compared to MB&B biochem - they have psets (take if you are bad at keeping up with material). They don't move quite as quickly since there's 2 semesters, and they probably dive a bit deeper into chemistry/physics. Still, material is largely the same. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I figure its better than the MBB version- 4 tests and youre done! No final ",
            "\u00a0Not really. If you have to take it then take it, but Ive heard that the structure of the MBB version is far more tolerable. ",
            "\u00a0Ok so everyone seems to like to hate on Biochem, but it was honestly way more fun and interesting than I thought it would be!  I would recommend this Biochem class if you are fine holding yourself accountable for keeping up with the material in a somewhat self-directed manner.  There is no graded homework, so it's fully on you to make sure you're doing what you need to to succeed.  That said, the lectures are super interesting and engaging and with some good, focused, studying, the exams are (very difficult) but not unreasonable.  The course definitely does pick up in the second half with Prof. Clay's metabolism module, but if you continue to pay attention, do the homework, and work with the teaching team to make sure you understand what's going on, you won't get left behind.   Overall, don't be scared to take this class, but do be prepared to work hard.  Very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of this course was very manageable. There were no problem sets, so it was easy to fall behind in material, but there wasnt that much for the first or second midterm so it was less of a danger. In the second half with Clay, the pace increased enormously. I could not have managed without the peer tutors. \r\nHowever, in terms of prep for the MCAT, this course is sufficient. My understanding of the difference between courses is that the other biochem requires intense knowledge of the mechanisms behind each reaction and the movement of each carbon, whereas this one only requires knowledge of the intermediaries, although mechanisms are indubitably helpful as a mnemonic. This course went into sufficient depth to satisfy my curiosity. Clay is tough but a good lecturer; Breaker is really sweet, but his test was so easy that it didnt affect grades at all; I dont remember Engleman but he only did four lectures. Overall, I dont regret taking this biochem. ",
            "\u00a0Great because noncumulative ",
            "\u00a0If you can take it with Breaker and Engelman, sure, take it. If Clay is teaching I wouldn't recommend this course. She's condescending and completely out of touch with students. I've never had a less rewarding learning experience. My friend left office hours to cry in the bathroom. Getting help should never be a shameful experience. ",
            "\u00a0For any other premed student, especially one who isnt majoring in one of the biological sciences, it is a great biochem course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class especially to someone who is looking to obtain a solid basis on how life occurs at the molecular level. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. The second half of the class is exponentially more difficult than the first half and it is not well-taught. The amount of material that is covered in that second half is insane and it feels Professor Clay just zooms through it without us really absorbing or understanding it. I've never had to study for a class in the past as much as I did for this one. I wish I had taken the MB&B version of biochemistry. Overall, this class was a fairly negative experience for me. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking at the two biochemistry courses, the one benefit of taking this course it that there are four noncumulative exams, which worked better for me because there was less material to know at a given instance. ",
            "\u00a0This course sucked, but you probably already knew that and have to take it for your major and/or premed anyway. The first half with Breaker isn't too bad, but the second half with Clay is awful. She's nice and all, but she goes way too fast for the amount of information covered. Also, everything rides on the four midterms (no section grade, no homework, no final!!) which makes things hell once you take her first exam. We weren't even allowed to take the makeup final to replace our worst grade. Sections were pretty useless, all the TA's did was read the answers to the problem sets. I honestly don't know why I kept dragging myself up science hill at night for them.\r\n\r\nHonestly, this course could have been much better if the material was broken up into more digestible chunks and we had more graded things. Weekly quizzes, weekly graded problem sets - something, anything would have been better than this. The information in the course itself is pretty interesting, though. If you have to take this class, STUDY EVERY DAY FOR IT.  Starting to study one week before the test won't be enough. ",
            "\u00a0If you are premed, take this course! If you have the choice of not taking biochemistry, I would look for a more interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is simply all memorization. If you're good at that then you should be fine. If not, you must start studying for exams at least a week in advance, especially for the second half of the course, which has an insane amount of material. Breaker's exam is fair, Engelman's asked for insignificant details that were not emphasized in class, and Clay's were straight-up difficult due to the volume and detail of the material. Clay covers way too much info in each lecture that makes it really difficult to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0First half is pretty easy, second half is rough. But overall it's a well-taught course and I learned a lot. It's great that there's no cumulative final. ",
            "\u00a0I would not take this course unless I had to.  It was very difficult and required a lot of studying and cramming for exams if you are like me and don't have a lot of time to study as you go along.  Some may find the material interesting, and I was interested in the applications of concepts we were learning about, but knowing all the tiny details was tedious and stressful. ",
            "\u00a0It's a difficult class. Not a fun time. Consider a lower course load if you are going to take this class. Also it's curved down which is pretty frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and nice tour of biochem. The lack of weekly homework was nice but be sure to study along the way so that the four tests are not as brutal. "
