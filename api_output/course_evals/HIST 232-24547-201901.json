            "\u00a0Skills-wise, some interdisciplinary approaches that were useful. Knowledge was a little scattershot, but definite a decent grounding in Modernist art history. ",
            "\u00a0A well rounded understanding ofand passion  for European modernism! ",
            "\u00a0This skill really helped me develop the ability to integrate intellectual ideas from various disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you a good overview of modernism, including art, architecture, and literature. It helps you develop analytic skills for social history. ",
            "\u00a0I gained such a great understanding of the basic ideas, motives, people, innovations, and events that make up the foundation of Modernism. I learned a new style of essay writing which involved putting a Modernist work in conversation with its contemporary critical review; the response papers were like nothing I had ever done before and I really developed my primary source analyzing skills. I've acquired so much knowledge about the progression of intellectual and cultural thought during this time as well as a great appreciation for this era and all of its complexities and interconnectedness.

            "\u00a0The instructor's enthusiasm was a plus and the texts he chose were excellent. Weaknesses were that we often didn't get all the way through the lectures, and the course felt very unfocused. To some extent that's understandable because it was a broad interdisciplinary course. However, it also often felt like a tour of the instructor's favorite authors and thinkers, rather than a coherent syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Noah is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0The course material is vaguely random and based on what the professor is interested in. Something there are more mainstream pieces of work, however, sometimes there are also arbitrary pieces that seem less relevant or interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I personally loved the way Professor Gentele started lecture with an anecdote, event, picture, or building and then ran through contemporary reviews, critiques, and responses to contextualize the anecdote/event/picture/building before ending with his take away and point about Modernism. It was a refreshing lecture style- so different from most history lectures and very well-suited to the topic. It allowed for discussion and enabled the essence of Modernism to really come through. I loved how we didn't spend time learning all the various terms and subgroups and names of art movements within Modernism; instead I got a good grip on the overarching intent of Modernists, what they aimed to accomplish in every discipline. This makes discussing any Modernist work much simpler because you can focus on what it does, not what category it falls under. A weakness of the course was our book discussion days. Sometimes they were too open ended and I often came very confused to class about the reading and yearned for a bit of a crash course in what I just read before beginning to analyze. "

            "\u00a0Yes. NZG is an amazing lecturer and so clearly know his stuff. He is the exact type of professor you want  incredibly smart, incredibly plugged into his field, and incredibly devoted to his students. The lectures were perhaps a little all over the place but unbelievably interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would, with reservations. The texts were wonderful and the classes were pretty fun, but it also felt a little all over the place. Take it if you don't mind unstructured learning and are comfortable drawing your own conclusions from a text, rather than agreeing with or following closely the professor's interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with the caveat that you should be aware it can become quite random and based on the professor's own interpretation of modernism. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course to other students! I believe Modernism doesn't get the attention it deserves in the course catalog. We have so many courses about ancient history, world history, and political history especially. This class is foundational in learning what has helped create modern thought since 1851 and it's a rigorous review of intellectual, cultural, and social thought and theory that truly expands the mind. I've learned so much and read so many things I would have never thought to read outside of school or in another class. The professor is also very smart, relatable, and helpful! "
