            "\u00a0This was, by all measures, an exceptional class. I developed a strong understanding of a) how states can play leading roles in climate change policy, b) what deep decarbonization means and requires, and c) ways to work with a client through a course to produce a valuable deliverable. I felt like I did not know much about this subject starting the course, but Professor Klee was phenomenal in explaining concepts in both an accessible and rigorous way. This course has made me feel more committed to wanting to pursue (or at least integrate) climate change in my professional life post-FES. ",
            "\u00a0Robert Klee offered great insights into environmental policy at the state/local level and I really appreciated the course taking a future-forward approach to looking at transportation, the waste industry, and other sectors. ",
            "\u00a0Policymaking process, policy analysis, advanced writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a range of local and state climate policies and actions taken by states to address climate change. I also gained valuable insight from Professor Klee's insights into working as the commissioner of DEEP. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0My expectations were far exceeded. Professor Klee selected an interesting topic every week, and he knew so much about each one and was able to color the lessons with personal stories and vignettes. Looking back, I can't quite believe how much material he was able to cover in only one semester! I also thought that the way he created room for discussion and invited questions was fantastic and lead to deep engagement on my part. I wish all my classes exceeded my expectations at FES in this way, but this course truly stands out as the most excellent one I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0Very well aligned and the small, in-class discussion was incredibly productive . ",
            "\u00a0Very well, this class far exceeded my expectations! Out of all the classes I have taken at FES, this one was the one I felt taught me skills I could tangibly apply to my career immediately. Having Rob as a professor was invaluable in being exposed to practical concepts in the policy field. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge and insights gained exceeded my expectations. "

        [
            "\u00a0A particular strength of this class is the way the lecture content directly supported our client project and vice versa. By working on a project that brought the materials to light, I was able to learn in both an intellectual and practical way. Another standout strength of the class is Professor Klee's willingness to support his students in office hours and provide as much personal insights and advice as we needed.\r\n\r\nNothing comes to mind for me about how the course could be improved. It was truly wonderful, and I hope all FES students have the opportunity to keep taking it for years to come. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great as was taught this semester. Rob's lectures were incredible! I usually am not a huge fan of powerpoint presentations but Rob really made their use a powerful learning tool. I suppose having more guest lecturers or site visits would add an interesting layer of exposure that would make for an even better learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths: the client relationship with the US Climate Alliance, the weekly lectures, the discussions we had (definitely facilitated by the small class size), and the semester-long decarbonization we wrote. "

            "\u00a0Take it, take it, take it!!! And convince your friends to take it too. They won't regret it. It is the best class I've taken at FES thus far, and I am excited to think about all the ways it will benefit me moving forward. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and I hope FES continues to find a way to offer it for others. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic course - 100% recommend taking it! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class!! The lectures and discussions were incredibly valuable to me in understanding what subnational climate action looks like in real life and Professor Klee is an amazing professor who was very willing to endlessly help us with our final project. If you are looking for a class about real world applications of (local and state) policy, this is it! "
