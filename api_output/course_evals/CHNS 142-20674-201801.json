            "\u00a0I came into Yale without being really able to read or write very much Chinese. It's been amazing to see the progress of the entire class throughout the year, and we've learned so many new Chinese words and concepts. We've also learned a lot about the Chinese culture, and I've really enjoyed some of the discussions that we have had in class. I also feel like my Chinese Class became a small community, and that was really nice. ",
            "\u00a0You learn grammar structures, vocabulary, and how to express yourself in more formal terms. Most of class is discussion-based, which can be very entertaining and great especially if you have active classmates! There are about 3 essays in the semester that you write on a prompt or topic of your interest, you then present it to the class. The class definitely improved my ability to express myself in Chinese with a much stronger vocabulary and advanced phrases. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of confidence in articulating my opinions and politics in Chinese. I learned a great deal of grammar, and all the vocab was immediately relevant to everyday life and my other academic pursuits. Fan Laoshi and Liu Laoshi also did a great job of introducing us to contemporary Chinese culture through movie discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Chinese culture I otherwise would never have had the chance to formally learn. I also learned a lot about the connection between language and culture in China, as well as greatly improved my vocabulary and familiarity with certain \"cheng yu\" phrases. ",
            "\u00a0I began the course with little to no ability to write Chinese at all. By the end of it, I feel like I have the tools, foundation, and passion to be able to continue learning Chinese on my own. I also feel much more attached to Chinese culture and the community at Yale afterwards ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write so many more Chinese characters! That aside, I also have come to understand Chinese society on a much deeper level than before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about Chinese culture and politics from in-class discussions; Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi were very, very insightful and were great in keeping us up-to-date with the relevant news and information. I also developed essay-writing skills and the ability to identify a couple hundred Chinese characters. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, writing, speaking Chinese. Better understood some Chinese social issues. ",
            "\u00a0I think my Chinese improved a lot over this past semester and I have a good grasp on a range of grammatical structures and a surprisingly useful vocabulary base. ",
            "\u00a0Chinese social skills, standards, culture, little bit of history, and language. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very organized, high level of engagement, reasonable grading, fair exams and assessments, useful content\r\nWeaknesses: really doesn't have any ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professors who really care about you, relatively constant workload (it is a lot of work but becomes predictable), you really have the opportunity to engage with class \r\nWeaknesses: class could combine more current cultural artifacts / studying from perhaps news pieces, songs, and other sources rather than just the textbook. Would help with being conversational on current topics of importance and can vary up the rhythm a bit (sometimes the text got boring) ",
            "\u00a0A strength was its straightforwardness. Each week, we knew exactly what we would be covering, and we knew exactly what the tests looked like. This allowed us to focus on the material itself and not worry so much about the logistics about the course. A weakness was that we moved very quickly through the material, quickly enough that we often moved onto the next lesson without fully understanding the current lesson's material. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was a great way to meet people of a similar heritage, and offered a lot of stimulating conversation about what it meant to be a Chinese American. I think that class would be much more productive just focusing on talking about culture, and having those conversations, then going over the textbook. Even practicing grammar would be much better than reading because I think that is something we can do on our own. ",
            "\u00a0I love the seminar format and the close relationship it forges with the students and the professor. In terms of improvement, maybe more concise PPTs and easier way of going back to grammar notes. Sometimes after class its hard to remember the grammar structures we reviewed. ",
            "\u00a0This second half of the beginner heritage learner's sequence is a lot like the first half in terms of workload (daily homework and quizzes, with exams and presentations sprinkled here and there), which I think is the appropriate amount necessary to facilitate learning. The most noticeable difference to me was that we now had to watch movies and discuss them in class, which I enjoyed a lot. However, we were only required to watch two movies, so I wish that we had watched more (contemporary, relevant) movies (or perhaps even other forms of media!). I also think that instead of repeating all the grammar structures for an entire class, it would be more beneficial to ask the class if they had any specific questions about the grammar to avoid wasting time going over things that were already clear. Moreover, I think having the entire class read aloud the lesson is not very useful--people just end up mumbling and not actually reading--I think having students go in order and read one line each is a better way to go about it. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: At times, the course felt like it was moving too quickly, and I was forgetting characters days after I learned them. But that's just the nature of learning Chinese, I guess  especially because there's so much material to cover over the course of one semester. The teachers were well aware of this issue, and taught the key concepts and phrases to us as best as they could.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Amazing, caring instructors! Chan Laoshi and Liu Laoshi made themselves available for help as often as possible, and got to know us as people as well as students. They really made my semester. They were quick to provide feedback on essays and homework assignments, and clear about their expectations and grading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructors very engaging, also very clearly cared about students. ",
            "\u00a0I wish I had been pushed to do more speaking because I still feel like that's a weak point for me. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about the course itself (not taking into account the professors) is fantastic "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes!!! The heritage track is a great way to learn Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're a heritage speaker, be warned that 142 is more work than 132 and there are higher expectations but I really loved the teachers and getting to explore parts of my culture/language/heritage/opinions more! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to read, write, and speak better, you should definitely take this course. A word of advice: you really have to participate in lessons and discussions if you want to get the most out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - for Chinese Americans, the heritage track was a great way to meet new friends and expand my cultural knowledge. I used to be pretty detached from Chinese culture, and I think this was a great way for me to get back in touch with my background in a very natural setting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Ive never felt more attached to a class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great way to engage with culture and heritage and the professors are incredible ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking to develop a solid foundation in reading and writing before going on to take higher-level Chinese courses--the pace is very manageable and you end up learning a lot. If you already have a foundation in reading and writing and are looking to improve your speaking skills, then perhaps the intermediate track would be a better choice because in 132/142, you often just drill grammar structures instead of engaging in impromptu, free-flowing conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The teachers recognized my needs as a heritage speaker with relatively little experience speaking the language, and pushed me out of my comfort zone to improve my learning processes. You won't regret having Chan Laoshi and Liu Laoshi. They're amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you want to improve Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course with not too much work (there's homework almost every night, but it's doable) and the professors are great. Without really noticing it, my Chinese improved a lot over the course of 142 and 132. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Liu laoshi is the best and the course really developed my language and social skills. The professors gives you suggestions on essay topics, but you can actually write about anything you want. Needless to say we had some very interesting essay topics that were very fun to discuss about after the presentations. Discussions in class can really be deep on the current issues in China and the US. Can be difficult at first but really becomes pretty chill after some weeks of getting used to. Tutorials are 1 on 1 and all the grad students are fantastic and super chill. Talk about anything you want. Overall a fantastic experience. "
