            "\u00a0Justin was an excellent TF, really making things easier for us in the midst of what I have already described as my overall chaotic experience in this class.  Our limited section meetings were fun, because Justin had lots of interesting things to say, and simultaneously encouraged our participation and engagement with the texts.  Justin's consultation with me about my paper, both over email and in person, was very beneficial to my paper-writing process; he took my argument seriously, and pointed me to good resources.  I also personally appreciate how he re-transcribed and neatened the course syllabus, and sent that version to us.  I wish we could have had more sections with him. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a great TF. A student can feel confident that he has an expert command of the information that we are covering. He is also very approachable and down-to-earth, while still being professional. Justin is very respectful of students' perspectives while also sometimes sharing his own interpretations. He also has a good understanding of the course and what Professor Wilson is looking for from us. The few discussion sections and the review sessions that we had with him were always productive and engaging. Great TF!!! ",
            "\u00a0Cynical - good and bad\r\n\r\nI loved Justin in the first semester of this course. In the second semester we had virtually no sections so I had very little interaction with him. As a result, little to go off of in evaluating him. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a phenomenal teaching fellow, as he was available through class and scheduled office hours to guide and direct through term paper and exam preparations. Honestly, there are no weaknesses in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is great! He's really thorough in his feedback and prompt with replies when you reach out. He was also really helpful in preparing us for our exams. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was always available to talk. He would give great feedback on paper ideas and would help me flesh out my thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was kind and present - although we only met with him a few times. He was clearly very skilled and knowledgeable. He worked to know our names and be present to each of us around the table. ",
            "\u00a0-Extremely well-read and experienced in the course material. Very helpful and accessible for paper consultation. I wish we could have had more sections with him, and engaged more with him and our peers. ",
            "\u00a0This instructor is very well appraised of what's going on the field and very dedicated to student success. He is always available to meet and always ahead of the curve on making sure students feel prepared for assignments and exams. His communication is excellent. Sometimes, he can be so concentrated on running an efficient and informative session that the discussion feels a little forced. The information and enthusiasm is always consistent. ",
            "\u00a0I consider Justin to be the most exemplary instructors who is not a professor (he's a doctoral student) I have had the pleasure to work with. He is helpful, accessible, and professional. His comments are thorough and are designed to help me think further about the material I was writing about. \r\n\r\nIf you could clone him, you would make YDS courses/sections the best ever. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was available to meet with us and aid in our understanding of the material. Unfortunately, we only had 3 section meetings during the entire course. As a result, Justin did not have the opportunity to impart his amazing knowledge of the Old Testament in ways that he is more than capable. Justin skillfully led the few section meetings we did have and gave us a taste of how to deeply read the Scripture. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was always available to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0Justin obviously really cares about his students and his passion for the material is obvious. He was very helpful in discussing my final paper, although he could have listened a little more to my ideas before telling me what he thought. In general, though, I really appreciate Justin as a TA and wish we could have had less lectures and more section meetings because I would have learned more about the material that way. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was available to help whenever help was requested.  He provided valuable feedback that allowed me to improve my thinking processes. ",
            "\u00a0We only had three meetings with our TFs all semester, as per Professor Wilson's instructions. That made it hard to grasp all of the material we covered. Justin was a great TF - available outside of class for extra meetings. He could be more focused in section and stick the topics instead of veering off on his own work. He could also be more timely in when he arrives for extra meetings with students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Justing was a wonderful Teaching Fellow. He was prepared for sections and was able to engage the class so that we could make the most of our short time together. It is clear that Justin cared about the education for not only his students but also the class as a whole. He held multiple review sessions for the final exam and repeatedly answered student's questions after class. His knowledge of the material was expansive and this was helpful for possible paper topics. ",
            "\u00a0Though we only had three section meetings, Justin was extremely efficient in his use of that time, guiding us through historical-critical readings of the texts assigned each week. He allowed for discussion and seemed genuinely interested in our thoughts on the material. This was a busy season for me and Justin was incredibly accommodating for my schedule when it came to tests and section meetings. His flexibility in that area was greatly appreciated. While I understand that the focus on historical criticism was necessary for the time that we had, I would have loved to see Justin incorporate other lenses of interpretation into the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was kind and thoughtful. He was very approachable.  We had very few sections, so it is difficult to adequately address abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Scott is wonderful. Unfortunately, he was hindered by us only meeting for section 3 times the whole semester. As someone who learns little from lectures, I feel we were deprived of a lot of learning opportunity. Sections are where I really figure out what's going on, and this class just didn't have them. ",
            "\u00a0I did not get much of a chance to assess/form an opinion of Scott's teaching because we only had section a couple times. However, my few interactions with Scott were helpful and I learned a lot from him. He was a great resource for questions about mid-terms and finals, as well as for advice on the exegesis paper assignment. ",
            "\u00a0We spent very little time in sections, so it's difficult to assess, but I thought he did a good job of leading us through the texts were were looking at in sections ",
            "\u00a0Scott was an excellent TF. His teaching style was clear and engaging, and his methods were straight-forward and helpful in understanding the practical application of lecture content. He made himself available for student questions, and provided  valuable guidance about hwo to best meet the class requirements. ",
            "\u00a0Scott is a wonderful TF. He respects all students opinions and invites conversation. He is approachable, encouraging, and affirming regarding paper writing and assignments. A true teacher and a gifted thinker. Very luck to have him as the TF. ",
            "\u00a0Sections were structured very thoughtfully and student participation was encouraged. The teaching fellow did a great job of getting students involved in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Davis was very knowledgeable and made the section environment comfortable and easy to contribute to. His in depth examinations of certain passages really helped illuminate the larger themes of their respective books. ",
            "\u00a0We only had two section meetings so Scott did not have much chance to teach, but both of the section meetings were worthwhile, and he kept the group engaged.  He was extremely helpful in writing my paper, and very encouraging. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was good at facilitating discussions. He was kind and allowed for multiple perspectives to be brought to the table. He often asked about the original translations for those who were taking biblical languages, which I feel drew in different classes and skill sets to the sections. This was enriching to even the students like myself who were not currently enrolled in a biblical language course, since it underscored the importance of reading the original text for the purpose of exegetical work.
