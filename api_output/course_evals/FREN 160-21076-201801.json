            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to practice speaking French and to improve my writing ability in this language. ",
            "\u00a0This course will expose you to a great depth of vocabulary that pertains to contemporary issues and ideas in France. Through meeting three times a week, your spoken French will become more automatic and fluent. The readings are all well-written and interesting, so you will learn a lot about current French culture, as it is seen by the French. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the contemporary social issues in France, as well as its historical influences on modern society. The course provides a well-balanced analysis of the pros and cons of French society and stimulates you to have a critical evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced speaking French. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to express myself much more fluently in French while also picking up knowledge about contemporary French culture through a variety of media. ",
            "\u00a0I gained French proficiency and cultural knowledge ",
            "\u00a0As the first French class I've taken for over a year, this course has really helped me get back into the language. I definitely improved my oral fluency, and seeing as we also did a fair bit of reading, I also improved my reading comprehension and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the nuance of French society and I also think my speaking and vocabulary improved. ",
            "\u00a0This class offers advanced speaking skills in French. The vehicle chosen, French history, politics, and economics, plus an introduction to the francophone  countries couldn't be more suitable. It gives the maximum vocabulary and greatly improves one's grammar and spoken expression. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the class, speaking is much better, and the vocabulary much more robust. "

            "\u00a0It is an excellent course, very-well organized and led by Professor Pinzka. The main strength is the structure of the class-you get to practice your French in a fairly casual setting by discussing various topics related to contemporary France. I can't really think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class was the subject matters addressed. Each class was interesting, and most of the topics presented students to many viewpoints which encouraged debate and discussion in class. At times, the readings seemed a little heavy given that we didn't address many of them in class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that we actually spoke French here. Good! But, there is TOO much reading. I did not do half of it because it was simply impossible to keep up with. ",
            "\u00a0The course facilitated group discussions based on readings and films, and explored a variety of angles of French culture. Partner presentations increased speaking confidence. I wouldve liked to have developed my writing skills more by writing a paper for the course. The tests were also a little too focused on memorizing vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0More student involvement and less talking from instructor ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reasonable workload, interesting topics, wonderful professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not really any ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is the best of the whole French Dpt. because you learn so much but also arent bombarded with busy work. I do think the oral exams, for which we werent given a whole lot of tips or strategies, are worth too much of the grade. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student interested in improving their French. It is an excellent, well-organized course, the material you cover is really interesting and Professor Pinzka is an amazing teacher. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to improve your spoken French and acquire new, useful vocabulary, I would definitely recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A good course to learn about French society and comparing French culture to your own culture. It is also a comprehensive course to develop your French skills. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student at L5 level who is looking to learn more about French culture and improve their conversation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes to those who want to work on oral French ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a wonderful class. Don't be afraid of how conversation-focused it is - I personally don't like speaking up in class, and this class was very comfortable for me. You'll learn a lot about French, and Madame Pinzka really cares about how you're doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I already have. Such a good way to keep up your French and learn a lot (without major stress!). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want to improve your spoken french, definitely take this class. "
