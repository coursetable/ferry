            "\u00a0The Writing Concentration served as a wonderful capstone to the many classes I've taken in creative writing at Yale. I had written long projects before, so the process wasn't new to me, but it was still a good challenge to draft and polish a longer piece of writing in only a semester. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a writing community through which I was able to conceive of, develop, and write a full-length play over the course of a semester. I also developed a more disciplined approach to my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is the perfect senior project if you're looking to really work on your creative writing over the course of the semester with one-on-one sessions with your professor. I got so much better at revising my own work and reading it with a critical eye. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I'm thrilled that the concentration has finally become more accessible to Yale students, and I'm hopeful that most of the things I struggled with won't even be a factor for future concentrators. ",
            "\u00a0This course is designed to benefit the individual writer, as well as the community of writers the course created. While the community aspect of the class was definitely one of its major strengths, the scheduling conflicts that ensued were its weakness. While I wanted to be able to make the writing lunches throughout the semester, I would either be unable to go or have to go early because of another class. The course could improve in concentration events such as writing lunches were organized via a Doodle Poll, and with more advanced notice, so the concentrators would have more ample time to plan their schedules. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. The best part is getting to work closely with a professor over the course of a semester and work to hone some pieces better. Would love for it to be a full-year option. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you had asked me this question a year ago, I would have said definitely not. The stress of applying, the lack of transparency of the decision making, the exclusive nature of who was usually accepted. But I am very happy with the new changes, and now I can say I would recommend the concentration to another student. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to devote a semester of your time to creating a single, sustained piece of work (or body of work), and youre working with an advisor you trust, then I cannot recommend the concentration enough. It was such a fantastic opportunity and experience, and I am so grateful I still get to be a concentrator next semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you can get into the concentration, it's so worth it! "
