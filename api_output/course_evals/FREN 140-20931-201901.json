            "\u00a0My French grammar--particularly written French, and vocabulary--was greatly improved.  Though conversation was not the primary focus, our discussions were invariably lively.  We also learned a lot about French culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0I have improved my French listening and reading abilities. A few presentations and informal in-class discussions have helped improve my speaking skills as well. Finally, the topics which we discussed and read taught me more about french history and the history of french-speaking countries around the world. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning more about the French language, we explored the francophone world and especially France through the course's selected texts. ",
            "\u00a0French 141 helped me refresh my grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and speaking skills, and built on them as well. We explored new literature and I became a more fluent reader. "

            "\u00a0The books are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Ruth Koizim is a terrific teacher who cares a great deal about every student.  Despite her affection for students, sometimes she can come across as harsh . As she herself acknowledges, she's tough, and if you don't have a sense of humor, you may not feel comfortable here.  She is hugely entertaining, speaks beautiful French, and clearly adores her subject. ",
            "\u00a0This course excels in providing steady work which promotes working on language abilities every day. The assignments were well set-up to improve french comprehension. Additionally, Ruth Koizim is a great professor and is very adept at explaining difficult concepts and keeping class engaging.\r\n\r\nThis course could improve in that some of the daily assignments take excessively long to complete. This is especially during the \"Sac de Billes\" unit, which required readings that took upwards of an hour to complete in addition to worksheets which took a similar length of time. Lightening the course load a bit would give students some breathing room and encourage better engagement. ",
            "\u00a0There is very little to improve in the course: it challenges the students but through challenging them they learn a lot of French. Some of the courses technological things, like voice recordings could be improved or updated, but aside from that there is nothing in the course that impedes learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength is its consistency. By doing homework every day and practicing in class, I built a stronger foundation for my French. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Improve my French a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to better their french language abilities, and I would further recommend they take the course with Ruth Koizim. ",
            "\u00a0STUDENTS BEWARE! Unless you have a pretty strong sense of French grammar, do not take this class with Madame Koizim expecting an A. It's not that she doesn't have the best interest in her students. She is just a very demanding instructor, and probably the strictest of her section compared to other F140 instructors. She's got a reason. She's been teaching for decades, and she's the head instructor of the F130/F140 circuit. \r\nIs it a rewarding experience? Yes. I have never worked harder in a class at Yale and still don't expect to get an A in. All the work is pretty relevant and will help you learn a lot of french. But honestly, this is a 2-credit workload. Not easy. Not one you should expect to get an A in unless you work your ass off like never before (or just know French very very very well).\r\nBEWARE the attendance policy. The 'excused' absences detract from your final attendance grade. It's probably better you try not to miss too many unless you absolutely need to. Madame is not very forgiving about this. Other than that, if you take it Credit/D and work hard, you'll enjoy it a lot. Really interesting literature that gets you at a linguistic level higher than most L4 languages ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it teaches a significant amount of French and it does that through very interesting texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent way to improve your French! It's no walk in the park, but absolutely worth the work. "
