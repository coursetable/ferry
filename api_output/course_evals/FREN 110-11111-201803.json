However, I found that is had a disproportionate focus on a video and in that did not address the students interest in learning utilize the language. While it seems valuable to have content from the video, this should be reduced to allow the students to interact more with the language itself ",
            "\u00a0I quite liked the way the course was laid out with the frequent tests which helped me to keep up with the content.  I think the immersion aspect of the course is good as it gets you used to hearing French. But for learning some of the more complex grammar rules I think it would have been useful to switch for English for just a small section of the class to avoid lots of confusion. "

            "\u00a0I think so yes. Though it was hard, I learned quite a bit about the french language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as it really does throw you straight into French and even though it is a lot of work it does teach you a lot in a short space of time. "
