            "\u00a0I learnt a huge amount about linguistics, cybernetics and computer science ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a strong overview of a range of theories of information and placed them in the context of one another to form a coherent understanding of the field of information studies. It encouraged me to see connections in areas where, without these frameworks, I would not have seen them before (whether these connections are natural or are a product of a particular intellectual approach remains an open and important question). ",

            "\u00a0The only thing I would add to this course is a bit more discussion time in class, so we can have both a lecture-type part of the class and a discussion part of the class to go over the readings and just express whatever it was we were thinking about. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered an immense amount of content in each session, making it very useful. Review/recapitulation of previous content was frequent enough for connections to be drawn between topics of discussion. Increased student participation might benefit the course, though it could also impede the amount of content addressed. Finding a middle-ground in which student notes on readings could either be shared or drawn on during the class might be one avenue for creating a more participatory classroom environment. ",
            "\u00a0Anthropology of Information gives great lectures on the subject matter. And he can synthesis theories from different fields in the most original and unexpected way. However, it will be great if we get to discuss the readings a bit more. The class consists of students on various levels, and from different disciplines, the discussion might be hard. However, if the seminar can be structured according to a few topics, it will be helpful. ",
