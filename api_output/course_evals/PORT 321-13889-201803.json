            "\u00a0Before I took this course I didn't know anything about the Inquisition, but now I have learned a great amount of information about the Inquisition period and how it has affected both Europe and the Americas. ",
            "\u00a0I used this course to get a better understanding on how race developed in modern history. The Inquisition is certainly an important period to study for scholars interested in colonialism, religion, and how the two are intertwined with race, gender, etc. "

            "\u00a0Amazing professor, interesting readings, and great discussions! ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you want an easy class. The readings are pretty low key and there aren't many assignments. If you want to know about the precursor to racial understanding and genocide, this works. But it doesn't go much further than that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Amazing course. Take this if you are genuinely interested in the Spanish Inquisition and want to actually engage with this material. This course is demanding, but also fair. It is not a gut! Be prepared to talk in class, write papers, and give a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about this subject. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone interested in race and anything it lists in the title. The papers are super doable and spaced out well throughout the semester. "
