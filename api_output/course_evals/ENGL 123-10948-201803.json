            "\u00a0I learned what makes a good writer as well as what makes good writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to produce poetry, fiction, and drama pieces while surveying and analyzing published pieces in the genre. I really felt like I grew as a writer, as I was pushed to explore new styles of writing and their nuances, as well as hear from some really excellent speakers throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I got a feel for and learned concrete strategies on how to write short fiction, different forms of poetry, and drama (monologue, scene, dialogue). I also gained exposure to the workshopping process. ",
            "\u00a0You will improve the way you think when you write creatively. You read good pieces of fiction and then apply them in weekly assignments that challenge the way you write. ",
            "\u00a0How to compress poetry, flesh out fiction, and escalate drama ",
            "\u00a0We learned some of the mechanics and tools to not only write fiction, poetry, and drama, but also read such texts in a new light. ",
            "\u00a0We talked a lot about how to escalate tension in fiction, poetry, and drama. Having thought about these things more in depth, I can appreciate the things I read in a different way. ",
            "\u00a0The class is comprised of three units: fiction, poetry, drama. Never having had experience in poetry, this is where I gained the most skills. Additionally, Professor Chapman's specialty is poetry, so her knowledge is greatest in this area. This class acts very much as a survey course. We learned about fiction structure, developing character and voice, different types of poetry, and various forms of dramatic writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the assignments every week; they weren't too much work to handle and they were fun exercises to challenge us as writers. Our classes were small enough that I got to really know the people and the professor, and I looked forward to class knowing that I would be engaged in what we were discussing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is rather strong. I found the guest lectures to be helpful for the fiction and drama units. For the poetry unit, however, the lecture was rather vague, which was disappointing. Making up for it though, was the fact that Professor Chapman herself is a poet, and in the end, I felt that I didn't miss out on anything. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were good because they were pretty frequent, but not long. You write them about weekly and have a chance to revise them all for your final portfolio.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that in covering Fiction, Drama and Poetry, you just get a taste of them all. When you finally feel comfortable in the form, it switches. The class is good for people who want breadth. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the curriculum\r\nWeakness is you have no idea what your grade is ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the guest speakers, the unit readings, and the feedback from the professor and our peers. ",
            "\u00a0Even though we didn't go in depth into any of the topics, I'm really appreciative of the breadth of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the format and structure of the course. Beginning and ending each unit, there is a guest speaker. Often times, these are some of the top people in this field, or at least people who have been incredibly successful in their field. This encouraged and inspired people to really engage in each unit. The weakness of the course is that it covers so much that often you just start getting the hang of a unit as it is ending. However, I think this is somewhat necessary because the course's aim is to cover a lot of ground. "

            "\u00a0If you enjoy creative writing, this really is the course to take. You learn a ton from the pieces you're exposed to in class, and Professor Chapman was always incredibly poignant and drove me to see works, especially poems, in a different light. It was a really fun course with a manageable workload, plus you hear from some pretty incredible people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ENGL 123 offers a great avenue for exposure to three genres in just one semester. It's great for if you're considering concentrating in the English Major, but aren't sure of which area you wish to choose (mind you, ENGL 123 does not cover nonfiction writing). If you just want more experience refining your creative writing, then this is an excellent class too. My section had a fair number of seniors who just wanted to experiment more with their personal writing. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far my favorite course I have taken at Yale thus far. I loved the areas of focus, the people in the class, the creativity and intellect it inspired, and everything about it. I highly recommend this course to everyone, no matter your level of writing experience. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to people of any major who want to write frequently and also challenge how they write. As someone who already enjoyed writing, I felt it was a good class for improving my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but dont credit d it! I did because I had no feedback at midterm but ended up doing well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Creative Writing to another student, especially a senior like myself. It's an interesting and dynamic class that has let me express myself in more creative ways than I have in the past, and I'm glad I took it before I graduated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class teaches the basic craft and skills of storytelling and poetry. It is an intro class so it is very low stakes and anybody can do it for a creative outlet. You can just do your own thing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in writing, even if you might be unfamiliar/uncomfortable with one of the genres. It's a great way to get your feet wet. Professor Chapman is a pleasure to work with, and she's always willing to provide additional feedback in office hours so that you can improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. This course very much depends on the people in the class. Often times, very little discussion participation existed which made the amount of learning feel less than other courses. Also, note that this IS NOT a writing credit. However, if you are interested in trying out various forms of creative writing in a relaxed setting, go ahead and take 123! "
