            "\u00a0I gained great experience discussing and writing about literature of different sorts - poetry, fiction, drama, photography, and film. The class was composed of literature students focusing on various different languages, which was particularly enriching for class discussion. I also learned about genres of literature I never would've been exposed to otherwise, such as Japanese Noh drama. The course also made great use of cultural events happening at Yale - we saw several plays, visited an exhibition at the YCBA, and saw a film screening at the Film Study Center. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't say I really gained any new \"skills\" from this class, but I did get some exposure to some very cool works of literature (broadly defined) that I would not otherwise have come into contact with. This included some great on-campus performances, Japanese n drama and its modern legacy, and Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (which I'd read in high school but hadn't appreciated at the time). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about literary analysis theory. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a strong ability to analyze different types of visual, cinematic, and print media. How to Read is an excellent class for training one to develop strategies in approaching all sorts of \"texts\" one will encounter. As a freshman Literature major, I found it particularly helpful in allowing me to establish my own voice and gain confidence in ascertaining author's intentions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different mediums and genres that I had not considered before - such as Japanese No drama. I learned better how to read in an interdisciplinary way - when film, theater, music, and such are combined with text. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course featured really interesting works, which were exciting to read/watch and discuss. It wasn't too work-heavy - some readings/viewings, then 3 evenly-spaced-out (and equally-weighted) papers. Sometimes the discussion could've used a bit more guidance, but I also enjoyed the freedom we had to talk about what most interested us. ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting class, with good discussions. The structure of the course could have followed a more chronological timeline, but I understood the value of teaching different genres separately. I would have liked to preface the genre with a bit of theory, rather than discussing theory and literary works simultaneously. ",
            "\u00a0How to Read is strong because it throws challenging cases for analysis at students who may be unfamiliar with them in their entirety. If you don't know film, literature, or drama well, take How to Read. It is an excellent primer in serious, excellent examples from different mediums and how one typically approaches it. For this reason, I think it is apt to term it a \"literary theory\" course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed being able to explore different mediums of art in relation to the question of how to read. For example, it was fun to read Chekhov's play, the Seagull, and compare it to the artistic decisions of Yale's drama department when they put on their own production of the play. The class dynamic was really nice as well - I felt that the students were able to contribute well and that Professor Trumpener was really accepting of taking the discussion wherever it would go.\r\n\r\nIt might have been nice to have a bit more structure to the discussions since at times they felt too broad. Also, I would have liked to be able to discuss some things more, such as the theory pieces, because it felt like we read them but didn't get a chance to talk about them. Focusing more on depth and not just on allowing for breadth would have been helpful at points during the course. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to any student interested in reading, talking, and writing about a broad range of literatures. Obviously, this course is required for the major, but I think this course would be exciting for students from any field who are interested in literature. ",
            "\u00a0Most people who take this class are required to for the literature major. Whether or not it should actually be required is its own question, but it is nice as a way to meet fellow majors. At least as taught by Trumpener, the class jumps around through a lot of somewhat unrelated works, which leads to it being somewhat disjointed at times but in a way that I felt was actually quite fun, since I could always count on something completely random coming up in the next week that I probably hadn't encountered before. The class feels like a chill book club and the reading is never too long. Three 7-page papers outside of class. It's pretty fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is very enjoyable given that it is a requirement for the literature major. It was a light introduction to theory and an enjoyable exploration of various literary genres. ",
            "\u00a0Would strongly recommend ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student - it challenged me intellectually, but did so in an extremely non-stressful and exciting way! Going to see different productions at Yale with my classmates made the experience fun and reminded me why I am so fortunate to be at Yale. Professor Trumpener was also great, and I think many people would enjoy and gain from this class. "
