It wasn't by any means a bad course, and Dr. Johnston makes it as fun and relevant as possible. Her presentations are well-organized, she does a good job responding to student feedback, and she gives a lot of examples that make stats more concrete. It's also a very easy course, provided that you put at least some effort into attending class and doing the psets. If you're serious about stats, however, and not just taking it as a requirement of psych/cog sci/neuro, you'd probably be better off taking an S&DS course. This class is weirdly math-averse (like, on the midterms, you don't even calculate anything, just plug numbers into a formula and leave it at that), so make of that what you will. It's also focused on SPSS, but SPSS is apparently becoming decreasingly useful compared to R or various other programs. ",

The only complaint I have is that, especially at the beginning of the semester, instructors didn't really respond on Piazza all that much (it was mostly students helping each other out). ",

It was the first course I have taken in two years at Yale that felt like it was really geared towards making sure the students understood the information presented, and the professor and teaching staff emphasized this.

            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching staff has many office hours to help students, lectures were accessible with many examples\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be helpful to slow down through the lectures and use PollEverywhere to gauge how well students understand the concepts ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this is by far the easiest course offered in Yale College. It only meets 2x/week and only for 50 minutes and ends early every single time. There is hardly any content covered and what is covered is very simple. Despite being a statistics course, you are not expected to do any math and don't even get a calculator on the exams (which are multiple choice/true-false and don't require any mathematical knowledge whatsoever). Grading is very generous and questions are very simple. This class is very middle-school-esque in its scope, requirements, and rigor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: limited content, useless software, professor. By far the biggest weakness of this course is that you don't learn anything useful. I was hoping to learn about how to calculate some statistics tests and maybe get into some multivariate stats, but we didn't do either of those things. We spent a long time on z-tests, which are by far the most useless of all the tests that we learned. The remaining tests (t, ANOVA) did not get a mathematical treatment, only conceptual (I don't know how to calculate them after this class). We didn't even get to repeated measures ANOVA or chi-squared tests. This class uses SPSS, which is by far the least helpful statistic software out there (its a glorified excel for those unaware). This class would benefit from learning something actually used in the field, like R or even python. Dr. Johnston was also not a very engaging professor. You could tell she cared about us but I don't think she did a great job of explaining the content (Google is your friend). ",

Lecture slides were detailed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course was a bit more challenging and went into other statistical tests that are commonly used (ex. chi-squared) instead of just concentrating on the small subset (z-tests, t-tests, ANOVAs) ",

",
            "\u00a0The course I think was well facilitated for learning. The problem sets and exams were straightforward and the way the semester was set up for learning had good flow. I think the final project could be taken away because I feel like the course is a good amount of work already with the two exams and ten problem sets. ",

            "\u00a0I think the problem sets help students solidify a working knowledge of statistics and allow us to see them in practice. Lectures were generally easy to follow, and the assignments could be interesting. We also got a lot of feedback on our work, which I appreciated. However, I felt that discussion section could have been managed better - they were often either too slowly paced or too quickly paced, and classmates were often unengaged. I also didn't think the final project should have been a group project, as needing to collaborate didn't really improve our project at all and often slowed us down. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness was not receiving grades for a pset until after you submitted the one for the next week. It didn't make sense to me at all because it made it hard to build upon concepts and know what errors to look for in the next pset. By not being able to see how you were doing and the ta feedback, the learning process was made more difficult. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were incredibly boring and went so slow. Watching the lectures on 2x speed was more effective than the actual lectures because it was so easy to get bored by the slow pace and tune out. Two actual things that Professor Johnston said were \"when you multiply a negative by a negative you get a positive\" and \"any number times 0 is 0\" which feel like concepts that are not apt for a college-level statistics course. The TAs were amazing though!! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-explained concepts, good timing\r\nWeaknesses: kind of slow/elementary knowledge at times, but i understand that's the type of course it is ",
            "\u00a0This course is good as an introductory course for STEM majors, who will eventually need to do statistical measures for labs and fellowships. This course is also good in the way that it does not assume prior knowledge of the subject and builds up skills that even help when taking Intro Psyc simultaneously. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that lectures often moved too quickly and it was at times really hard to follow. Slowing down and being more clear may have been beneficial to the students' understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most straightforward math-related courses I have ever taken at Yale and I appreciate that so much. Everything was easy to follow and this made me more engaged with the material and actually made me enjoy studying/learning. I didn't like that we had to pay to use SPSS, and how that was a major focus of section but we didn't really use it elsewhere. I wonder if this is the best way to facilitate the learning of statistics and if perhaps there is another way that doesn't involve learning a program I may never use again. Also, I think questions on Piazza could have been answered a lot quicker and it would have been more helpful as we worked through assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think it engages students very well. ",

Teaches good fundamentals, fair grading, fair exams, good sections.\r\nWeaknesses:  maybe a bit rushed with material towards the end, but also otherwise this didn't feel that interesting because I feel like there's way more we can do with stats that's super interesting that we didn't really get into at all.

You hardly cover any actual stats tests, and the ones you do are very simple and you don't even learn the math behind them.

Not only is SPSS extremely outdated and used by literally nobody in 2019, it also is one of the only options that is not free and not offered by Yale ITS for a temporary free license.
