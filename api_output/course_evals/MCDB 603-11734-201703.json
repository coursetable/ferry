I actually spent a lot of time in it and regard it as a good chance to improve my writing. Thus I am really looking forward to receiving suggestions about it! ",

The more successful ones were those that delved into the papers and the discussions that branched from that. Those that re-lectured material were not as engaging. Additionally, those that felt like they were rushing to go through the material made the class time shorter. "
