I learned not only the knowledge but also the general way to model and solve a problem.\r\n\r\nWeakness: We did not have problem sets in the first half. Also maybe we can replace the problem sets with a term paper. ",

My suggestion is that we should get more practice opportunity throughout the whole course to strengthen our understanding, ",
            "\u00a0The lecture notes are very detailed and the instructors are very engaged in teaching. But the course seems to aim to convey more than a single semester can do. There are some gaps in different parts. It would be better if it could be slower. "
