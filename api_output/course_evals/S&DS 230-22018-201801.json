Often it would be promised by a certain day and the promise would not be fulfilled. This made it difficult to plan my workload with my other classes. I would say that the quality of the class would go up immensely if problem sets came out consistently. ",
            "\u00a0More TF's and more structure in terms of uploading assignments on time - often felt like they were understaffed (so this may be more of a feedback for YC). Overall, office hours were very helpful and the professor was v available to answer questions. Manages to cover a lot of stuff in a short period of time - the content can be distilled a bit more, would oftentimes review kind of mathy sections but then be like oh this is just the math you're not responsible for knowing these. ",
            "\u00a0JDRS does a good job of explaining things, going through the code, etc. I feel like it might have been good to go through some of the code stuff a little slower. I did fine with it, but I know that some of my friends are afraid of the coding in this class, and I honestly don't blame them, since if I weren't naturally experienced I imagine I would have struggled. Also the organization wasn't great... psets coming out late, not having too much time to do them, deadlines and schedules being pushed back. But this was JDRS's first time teaching this, so I hope the organization will improve once he has it down. Also big strength, it was on video recording so we didn't have to go to class in person at 9am! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are the instructor, many TAs, course format (videos to look back to and/or use to 'attend' lectures any time), and the combination of R and statistical material. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this was just way too easy. I feel like I learned but didn't retain--I have to look things up to remember how to execute them. ",
            "\u00a0The style which this course was taught was very flexible and adaptable. I wish problem sets had been a little less straightforward and more challenging - sometimes they just followed the class beforehand, which was fine with me, but on busy weeks I would end up using the information from class instead of integrating it into my brain in patterns. I wish there was a little more emphasis on statistical methods during the course and the math used: I found myself wondering specifically about the math, as it is the gateway stats course. But I loved it nevertheless. ",
            "\u00a0I love the online lectures, and JDRS is a fantastic lecturer. The problem sets were always a bit short and a little too guided, which made me feel like I wasn't getting a lot out of them, but still they helped me get good practice with coding in R. ",
            "\u00a0LOVE that he videos the lectures. I think this is extremely helpful for a programming class because you are able to keep the code open on your computer while watching the video on another desktop, on which you can also see JDRS's coding screen and the notes. Having taken ENAS 130, this class method was way easier to understand, because you are better able to follow along. If you don't understand something/miss something, you can go back versus in real time, you will often miss changes in codes that may be integral. ",

            "\u00a0Enjoyed having the classes filmed (class was 9 am in the morning, which I was not often awake for). JDRS is also a clear lecturer and it was easy to follow along. \r\n\r\nI wish the p-sets were a bit more difficult. I felt like I was copying code over directly from the lecture notes half the time. The data cleaning p-set was probably a good level difficulty to set the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0P-sets were easy, which was good and bad because instead of focusing on getting something right I was able to dig in more and look at what i had done more closely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wouldn't have been able to wake up for this class if I actually had to go -- very helpful that lectures are recorded. Problem sets were helpful in learning the material. Lectures were very well organized and covered a lot of material. JDRS's personality and sense of humor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very slow feedback. Homeworks/exams were more regurgitations of class notes than independent thinking exercises. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great as the material was very good and moved at a very fair pace, introducing a lot of new material. The teaching was fantastic, and having all the lectures online was great when I had to miss a few lectures. The only thing I would say is that a lot of the psets/exams could be done by copy and pasting code from JDRS which greatly reduced the amount of critical thinking needed to do them. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was generally well taught, but honestly some of the grading appeared to be arbitrary! ",

            "\u00a0strengths: gain lots of knowledge in just one semester, feel comfortable coding in R, much more stats knowledge\r\nweaknesses: can be kind of scary to jump right in if you have never coded before (me), was a bit overwhelming at first. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Uhh its freaking awesome! You learn how to do cool data analysis using RStudio, and Jonathan is a boss, as are the TFs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing really, it was a solid overall experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the PSETS helped you apply and understand the material from lecture and lecture was pretty interesting/helpful\r\nWeakness: none ",
            "\u00a0It was well organized, but it was kind of easy and not very challenging. It could be a little more theory heavy and the problem sets could be less directly copied from the lecture notes. The final project was a good way to summarize the entire course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Show you a wide variety of statistical techniques, how to use them. Good introduction to R. \r\nWeaknesses: Did not help me understand how/why statistics works. Since lectures were at 9AM in Kroon hall, and since lectures were livestreamed, barely anyone showed up to class. As a result, there was no sense of class community. ",
            "\u00a0It could be a little harder so we had a more normal grad distribution ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course teaches an incredibly useful skill, coding in R. If done well, students can graduate the course with a very useful, employable skill. \r\n\r\nThis course also had SPECTACULAR student TAs. I would like to especially highlight Tra and Gina for the effort and dedication they put into helping students through the problem sets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although coding in R is an incredibly useful skill, there are good ways and bad ways to teach it. Unfortunately, the problem sets didn't push us to come up with our own code for R and could often be solved by copy pasting lecture notes (pretty much verbatim). This did not encourage me  to understand the code as I completed the problem sets, instead, I often just tried to get the problem set done. Additionally, even though there is a stats requirement for this class (this shouldn't be your first stats class) Professor Reuning-Scherer would reference statistical processes and jump right into the code, instead of spending time introducing them and connecting them to other statistics knowledge at largethis made it a little hard to understand when we would apply a code in R. Lastly, Professor Reuning-Scherer often posted problem sets late. I understand that he was likely busy with research or his family, but consistently posting homework assignment late is just annoying to students who then aren't able to factor it into their plan for the week. ",
            "\u00a0The online lectures are so helpful and make it easy to stay engaged with the class when you don't want to walk up science hill early in the morning! They should keep this going. ",
            "\u00a0Allowed to make mistakes was a strength.  Not many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the professor and TAs have a ridiculous amount of office hours. The psets are straightforward and the course is well taught and manageable even though I have no statistics background. The one weakness is that sometimes the psets can be released late and that can be stressful in terms of the rest of your work, but it was always manageable. ",
            "\u00a0\tInstructor: \r\no\tProfessor JDRS is nice and helpful and generally explains things well in class. He is quite hardworking and plans well. He makes himself quite available for help during office hours/on Piazza and is helpful and encouraging with psets and projects\r\no\tUnfortunately, he made the class a bit too easy. He would edit the p-sets to make them short and too mechanical. Although the focus of the class was to teach you R and bare data analysis skills, he avoided the statistics too much  to the extent that I would need to understand the same thing again each time I was doing a p-set and completely re-understand fundamental things for the final project. The teaching style meant that retention of principles was limited.\r\no\tIt is hard to truly assess him because the class is very easy and he didnt have to teach particularly insightful matters\r\n\tAssignments:\r\no\tAs with most coding classes, you learn mostly from the p-sets. The p-sets were generally helpful because they made you redo all the key work in the class and that made the lectures a lot clearer. Each assignment also had new data sets so there were always interesting things to study.\r\no\tSome of the initial assignments were challenging and very interesting e.g. the first data cleaning exercise required hard work, was just a bit frustrating/challenging and enabled creative license\r\no\tHowever, most of the assignments were mindless copy pasting of the code from the lecture code notes. This was good to reinforce the material and we did learn a decent amount but I was unbearably bored in most of them (some felt torturous) and thats why there were silly mistakes/no incentives to check the answers\r\no\tPlenty of office hours every day and Piazza activity to answer questions even at the last minute\r\n\tCourse content (Lectures):\r\no\tThe lectures were recorded so there was no need to go to class, which was immensely helpful for a 9 am class. Each class also had a code document, a knitted HTML file, some pdf notes etc.\r\no\tThere were plenty of resources to catch up on Intro Stats etc.\r\n\tWays to improve:\r\no\tMake it harder e.g. shorter p-sets with more thinking/challenge and creative license rather than mechanical copy pasting\r\no\tTeach less statistics if necessary but teach it in more detail/better\r\no\tDont waste so much time on less useful things like bootstrap\r\no\tTrain the TFs/make their teaching consistent and uniform/make the office hours more uniform ",
            "\u00a0Strength: JDRS's teaching, breadth of topics covered, availability of teaching staff\r\nWeaknesses: psets don't reinforced lecture content that well ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength of this course is that it is filmed and posted online, which allows students the option to learn at their own pace. I really enjoyed that. Otherwise, I think the desire for student feedback was really cool  the professor would always ask for everyone's opinions about what forms and methods of learning work best for the class before continuing with any particular one. Not to mention, the instruction itself was super clear (even though this class can involve some tough concepts).\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this class was the time. It should not be a 9am lecture. If that time is changed (perhaps to an afternoon lecture), my engagement would have been far higher. ",
            "\u00a0strengths-- flexible for learning (recorded lectures, take home exams, lots of office hours, etc); weaknesses-- at times disorganized (psets posted very late and deadlines extended accordingly sometimes threw off my schedule) ",
            "\u00a0The class is very practical and hands on. Also Prof. JDRS does much to provide lecture and class material in various forms (videos, script files, pdfs etc.) which allows students to choose the format that fits them best and greatly facilitates the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of resources that you can use to learn in this class.  The lectures are recorded and put online where they can be watched alongside the R-code used in class, supplemented by PDF notes.  Everyone learns differently and this class has enough resources that you can find what's right for you.  There are also like 20 office hours per week so help is there when you're stuck. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is very well taught. The lectures are engaging, the homework is closely aligned with what we covered in class, the notes are clear are helpful, and the teacher is really funny and good at teaching. I really enjoyed the fact that the lectures were filmed at put online, which made the 9 AM class time bearable on those days when the weather was terrible. The tests and the final cover exactly what we learned in class, and the fact that they were take home tests made the class very un-stressful. The expectations for the class were very clear, and JDRS, Henry, and the peer tutors were always quick to respond on Piazza which was very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much really. The class wasn't hard, which may be something that should be improved, but that's really up to the instructor and department about how they want to present the course. I came in as someone who had never taken a single statistics course, but I did have a bit of experience programming with R and about a decade of programming experience overall, and I found the course extremely easy. For me this was really nice, but perhaps we could have learned more if the class was either faster-paced or covered topics more in-depth? Please note that I wouldn't advocate for making the tests \"harder\" by making them in class or reducing the time we have to work on them --- I don't think that serves to improve anyone's learning and just adds unneeded stress. I really enjoyed the course overall. ",

            "\u00a0This was an excellent course that was designed to accomafate students as best as possible. Lectures were recorded on Canvas so students who were unable to attend class could watch lectures online and review all the class notes and code. Review material for intro stats topics were also made available as well as more complex material delving into statistical and mathematical theory for interested students. Parts may have been slightly more difficult as they were near copies of class code and notes and could he designed to make students think more. ",

But with his upbeat voice, funny anecdotes, interesting data sets, and will to tell a story with the data analysis, this class was truly awesome.\r\n- The recordings of the class were wildly helpful. While I know this inspired many to never come to class, for me it offered the flexibility to spend those three hours a week learning when I knew would be best. I went to class as often as possible, however if I had been up late working on a Monday night, I had the reassurance that I would get enough sleep Tuesday morning (because I could watch the lectures later) and feel re-energized and ready for school again.\r\n- The screen set-up was very helpful. I would download the Rmarkdown file right before class and follow along, running the code as I watched Johnathan do it, which kept me engaged and helped me learn what each function was doing.\r\n- The assignments were really good and fair. The homework assignments pulled right from our class content, but we could also use the internet to figure out things if necessarym and the fact that it was designed for that put the assessments at the perfect level for our state of learning.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Very important stuff to know, and if you have a little stat experience and a little coding experience (if you don't have coding experience it's still doable, just need to work harder at the beginning to learn some of it), it won't be very hard. Psets were actually kind of fun I thought, and I enjoyed the final project. Also kudos for having the exams be take-home. That's how I think all exams for coding classes should be. ",

You will get out of it what you put in to is, JDRS could not be any more accessible, and my comfort level with data analysis and coding is incomparably higher than before this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great place to get exposure to R, but if you're serious about that side of things, you should either take a higher level class or be prepared to dive deeper into things on your own. The class is designed to be light on theory, but towards the end, when you're doing complicated analyses (in the theoretical sense) but that only require a single command to execute, it starts to get a bit too simplified.

Knowing R is so useful for jobs, and this class teaches you R extremely well. I hated coding/programming (if you consider this programming) before this class because of ENAS 130, and wow I have a much greater appreciation now. I could actually understand this class, and the video lectures are so helpful, as you can rewind if you miss something and can use multiple desktops to keep everything open that you want. \r\n\r\nWorkload is definitely reasonable--weekly homeworks, 2 take-home exams, and a relatively easy/short final project. JDRS is also such a fun teacher, and he is always there to answer questions. I showed up every Monday to his office hours, and he would always help or ask whether I was glad I had switched into the class (he convinced me to do so in the fist place). 10/10 would recommend taking. I loved this class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. R is very useful in a variety of fields, and you use it to do all of your work, which means you will (hopefully) get pretty skilled at using it. This class is not heavy at all on stats theory, and is more focused on building your ability to generate and interpret statistical results. The homework, exams and project are not bad, there is plenty of code from class to learn from as well as an entire Internet of answers, and Jonathan and the TFs are always there to help.\r\n\r\nTake this class! ",

            "\u00a0This class was incredibly useful for my life (I used much of the knowledge gained in this class to do stats analysis in my senior thesis). Data science skills are becoming increasingly important and this class was a great way to review and learn new stats concepts and also learn to program in R. ",

            "\u00a0Course is a very useful overview of critical R techniques (especially data cleaning and linear models) and a basis for advanced development (data scraping, optimization of models). With Professor JDRS (a solid teacher), it can get a bit mindless and mechanical and the fundamental statistics is poorly taught but still one of the most useful classes you will take for skills at Yale.\r\n\r\n\tInstructor: \r\no\tProfessor JDRS is nice and helpful and generally explains things well in class. He is quite hardworking and plans well. He makes himself quite available for help during office hours/on Piazza and is helpful and encouraging with psets and projects\r\no\tUnfortunately, he made the class a bit too easy. He would edit the p-sets to make them short and too mechanical. Although the focus of the class was to teach you R and bare data analysis skills, he avoided the statistics too much  to the extent that I would need to understand the same thing again each time I was doing a p-set and completely re-understand fundamental things for the final project. The teaching style meant that retention of principles was limited.\r\no\tIt is hard to truly assess him because the class is very easy and he didnt have to teach particularly insightful matters\r\n\tAssignments:\r\no\tAs with most coding classes, you learn mostly from the p-sets. The p-sets were generally helpful because they made you redo all the key work in the class and that made the lectures a lot clearer. Each assignment also had new data sets so there were always interesting things to study.\r\no\tSome of the initial assignments were challenging and very interesting e.g. the first data cleaning exercise required hard work, was just a bit frustrating/challenging and enabled creative license\r\no\tHowever, most of the assignments were mindless copy pasting of the code from the lecture code notes. This was good to reinforce the material and we did learn a decent amount but I was unbearably bored in most of them (some felt torturous) and thats why there were silly mistakes/no incentives to check the answers\r\no\tPlenty of office hours every day and Piazza activity to answer questions even at the last minute\r\n\tCourse content (Lectures):\r\no\tThe lectures were recorded so there was no need to go to class, which was immensely helpful for a 9 am class. Each class also had a code document, a knitted HTML file, some pdf notes etc.\r\nThere were plenty of resources to catch up on Intro Stats etc. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend -- it's a laid back but still substantive way to learn an extremely useful set of skills. Jonathan is a chill (though at times cheesy) instructor, and so are the rest of the TAs. The class is exceptionally well-organized, and the material level is appropriate for students. Take it, but be sure to make it to class and stay on top of lectures! It is possible to do well without attending lectures, but you will gain a lot more if you are diligent about the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it makes hard statistics much easier, and you walk away with real career-savvy knowledge that will help you in the future if you plan to work anywhere that requires data analysis (which is an increasingly large set of jobs nowadays). The class itself is straight-forward and low-stress as well! ",
            "\u00a0yes...this was an amazing stats class for someone with some stats experience who still wanted to learn some new things. i feel like i gained a new skill with R! ",

            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning R, take this class.  It's not really a stats class as much as an intro to R.  Whatever interests you have, learning R will help you gain more insight into them.  For example, I can do far cooler sports analytics projects after taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely I would recommend this course. I took it because 1) I had never taken a statistics course before (even in high school) and as a Physics student I wanted to know a bit more about statistics and about data science in general, and 2) I was looking for a programming-heavy course with a reasonable workload with minimal focus on exams. This class delivered on both of those spectacularly. This was by far my easiest course this semester, and I still learned a lot! It was easy because you don't need to stress at all about the exams or the final project. The exams are take home, and you'll have a week to work on them, and the final project is very easy to do if you've payed attention at all in class. I came in with no background knowledge of statistics other than realllllly basic probability, and JDRS covered (reviewed quickly, but enough that I could learn the topics) all statistical tools we would implement in R. The expectations for the class are really clear, and the lectures are actually really good and funny (you will come to love Eileen and all her shenanigans by the end of the course). The fact that the lectures are filmed is just icing on the cake at that point. If there is a gut statistics course, it's this one, and you will still walk away with a lot of knowledge that you didn't have before. 10/10 would take again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - R is straightforward and fun to use. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. The class was fun - I was able to learn a lot that was useful not only for the class but in real life applications. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but actually keep up with the course. Because it's video-recorded, it's easy to say you'll watch the lectures later and then all of a sudden, you're 2 weeks behind. JDRS is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0yes, for the R skills. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! Learning R was absolutely incredible, it gives you a whole new array of tools to think about and analyze data/research/surveys/etc. I ended up using R for my Psych and the Good Life final project to analyze my research. I intend to use this skill later in life, and the class itself is fun! Get a friend to take it with you, and it will be a great experience! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, statistical analysis in R is a very important skill to learn ",
            "\u00a0Very lenient intro stats course. All the videos for lectures are posted online and the professor/TAs are very accommodating and just want you to learn the material ",
            "\u00a0It is a good introduction to the ways of thinking used in data science. I took it as an introduction, not planning to major in S&DS or even take multiple other courses. I feel that the course has given me a solid background in understanding the logic used by programmers and how data is treated. ",
            "\u00a0Yep! It's a solid introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it gives them a solid R programming foundation ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good way to learn R. Make sure to keep up with the online lectures (or go to class every time) or else it is very easy to fall behind. The PSETs are manageable and the final project is an interesting way to synthesize what you learn in the PSETs. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course gives an excellent introduction to data science in the programming language R. The workload is only to the point of necessity (about 3 hours per pset) and lectures and notes are all online (at least for Dr. JDRS). No bs, learned a lot, and didn't require much time commitment. Professor JDRS is also super nice and super willing to help his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, best class to learn R in.  Workload is very low, there are no in class assessments, so if you put the time in, you will do well.  JDRS is a funny professor and great at answering questions.  Highly recommend. "
