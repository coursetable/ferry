            "\u00a0I learned very advanced grammar concepts, as well as new vocabulary, and really improved my ability to write, read, and listen in the foreign language. ",
            "\u00a0SPANISH S140 through the Bilbao Study Abroad Program helped strengthen my understanding and use of all verb tenses and grammatical knowledge through the introduction of future, conditional, and other forms of the subjunctive. Through secuencia verbal, I was able to really test myself on my knowledge of Spanish grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of grammar and vocabulary in a very short time. ",
            "\u00a0Fluidity in Castilian Spanish, and a greater world purview. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with more speaking, listening, and writing skills as well as many more grammatical lessons. ",
            "\u00a0I was familiarized with Spanish grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Expanding Spanish vocabulary to include all subjunctive forms and more \"perfect forms\" (ie pluscuamperfecto, pretrito imperfecto, future perfect, conditional perfect) and other more complex grammatical arrangements. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to read, write, and speak Spanish during this course. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, students further their knowledge of advanced Spanish grammar, including more tenses in both subjunctive and indicative moods, and other topics such as uses of \"se\" and reported speech. These skills are practiced through a short novel, the oral presentation, and conversations with partners. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better form grammatically correct and more complex sentences in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my level of proficiency in the language "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It is very well organized to facilitate student learning, every homework assignment, every class activity was very helpful in my experience. However, it did move incredibly quickly through new grammar concepts, which I know is because there was such little time, but I think I could have used more time with explanations before jumping into using the grammar. ",
            "\u00a0The professors for my section, Sebastian Diaz and Maripaz Garca, are terrific. It is clear that both professors care about their students' development and learning. Office hours were very accessible and plenty, as this summer course goes quickly through material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very in depth and we got a lot of practice on all the grammar points we studied. However, it sometimes because very overwhelming to keep up with the work and be able to explore Spain itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The main strength of this course is the fact it was taught 100% in Spanish in Spain. The immersive nature of the course, when combined with the phenomenal professors creates the perfect environment for learning.\r\nWeaknesses: As I have said before (and will undoubtedly repeat) I would consider adjusting the itinerary of this program to more closely resemble that of Portuguese or Russian language programs, with 5-weeks abroad, or even mirroring Italian, with the full 8-weeks spent in Bilbao. ",
            "\u00a0The sequence that the grammar lessons were taught worked very well in-unison with our skill development and understanding of the language. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fast, as expected, but manageable. The readings were all too similar and filled with so many unknown words that made any kind of flow of reading impossible. Supersite can be good to drill in grammar, but many of the activities are too selective and don't aid in learning at all. ",
            "\u00a0As was the case with all other Spanish courses I have taken at Yale, the course was well organized and well taught. Straightforward in that you should do well if you take the course seriously and study hard. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improved my Spanish skills tremendously over a short period of time. I would say the only weakness is that it requires a lot of work. You get what you put in to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The topics for this course can become very complicated very quickly, but the exercises/activities in class lead students to understanding fairly well. A weakness would be the lack of introduction to the bigger picture with all these themes at first, and then diving into each one.\r\n\r\nOne day in class, we went on a mini-tangent about phrases that natives of Spain use a lot in their everyday language. I feel like this would be a valuable, short lesson that could be included in the course or program. Since we were studying and practicing Spanish in an actual Spanish-speaking country, it would have been nice to have learned some more phrases they use commonly. ",
            "\u00a0The course helped me learn a lot of Spanish. There were many worksheets to help me learn the material. There were not many weaknesses of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are vast vocab and grammar covered in such a short period of time and the immersion portion for the month which allowed for opportunity to develop greater fluency "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to continue learning Spanish, it is a very good class to learn the necessary advanced grammar concepts that one would need in order to get to the next level of the language. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the Bilbao Study Abroad program as a whole. One truly improves on their Spanish through the direct placement of oneself in a Spanish speaking world. Bilbao (and Pas Vasco as a whole) is truly incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone else because we were able to learn a lot about the language, while being immersed in the culture. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This program is a remarkable opportunity for all Yale Students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is dedicated to learning the Spanish language and who is not shy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You will actually arrive at a point where you are quite comfortable speaking and listening to/comprehending Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. It exceeded my expectations and made me interested in learning more about the Spanish language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to another student. The lessons in this course are so important to one's understanding of Spanish and their ability to speak the language to its fullest extent. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, as long as they are willing to put the effort in to learn Spanish. ",
