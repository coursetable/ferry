            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this class, and it was particularly challenging for me with my background. I learned about fundamental forces and how they are relevant in everything. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned about forces on a much more fundamental level. We were instructed on how to give a good presentation. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave an interesting overview of the derivation of forces and various forces to consider in different systems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about forces, which will facilitate my research and greatly broaden my horizons. ",
            "\u00a0Learned atomic forces ",
            "\u00a0how to make a good presentation (slide and present) ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is the organization in the lectures. The instructor talks about concepts in lecture without really introducing the fundamental idea first. If I read the book beforehand, I was able to follow along because the instructor gives detailed information on the topic. However, if I didn't read the book, I sometimes left lecture wondering what the lecture was even about. That is not to say I left without learning anything, because that is not true. But sometimes I couldn't connect the small details to a larger picture without reading the book. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - (1) Thorough, constructive feedback on our presentations; (2) thought-provoking homework assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - (1) Unclear syllabus (It would be better to include chapters and sections from the book that coincide with the lectures.); (2) Unproductive lectures (I felt like I learned more from reading the book. The questions the professor asked were never very clear and usually took at least 5 minutes to understand his questions to be able to answer them to his liking. He should learn how to ask more leading questions so class time isnt wasted from the confusion.); (3) Homework didnt seem to align with the lecture topics; (4) The final exam was moved to the last week of class because he called it a midterm even though it covered everything we learned from the semester (it should either be moved earlier (since its called a midterm) or during finals week (after reading week since it actually was a final); (5) The presentations were held during 1.5 days during the reading week. (This is not a good use of time, and reading week should be students time to study for finals. The professor should schedule one student presentation a week throughout the semester to be held during class time so we can have more time during reading week to study); (6) The final (aka the midterm) asked questions that were not well representative of the lectures and homework assignments. Many of my classmates were also surprised by the type of questions because of the way the class was taught. (7) The class should also cover more applications of forces on the nano scale (It would be useful for most of the students in the class who dont need to understand this material in as much depth as was covered. Covering SEM, AFM, etc. and how those relate to forces on the nano scale would make this class more useful for engineeeing students to care more about the application of these forces.); (8) There should be homework solutions if the TF isnt going to explain why points are marked off. ",
            "\u00a0The assigned textbook for this class is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The course started out organized and engaging, and I thought I was going to enjoy it a lot.  However, as time progressed, the lectures jumped around a lot and didn't seem to follow a logical organization to me. Luckily most of the material covered was in the book (which was really clear). By the middle to end of the semester, I did not feel like I gained a better understanding through attending class, and could have learned more just reading the book during that time. By the end, class frequently took 10-15 minutes to really get started and routinely went over time. Problem sets asked interesting questions that were engaging to research. However, questions were asked very broadly while specific answers to unstated questions were expected. As a student, this was frustrating to attempt to anticipate what was expected. We were told our exam would take longer than a normal class (~2 hours), but on the day of the exam, we were informed it was actually a 3 hour exam. This was frustrating and felt disrespectful of our time and schedules, as students easily could have had other responsibilities during that extra hour following the exam. I think better organization for lectures (especially toward the middle and end) and clear communication of expectations would significantly benefit students in the future. ",
            "\u00a0strong: class is clear. Professor will answer the question in detail and is very responsible.\r\n\r\nweakness: progress is too slow. I choose this class because I want to learn some forces in biological systems, such as hydrophobic, hydrophilic. But for the first several class, we just talked about something like strong force, weak force, which I am totally not interested in it at all. ",
            "\u00a0Very detailed course and Professor is very patient and push us learn something by ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0flexibility ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- course material is interesting\r\nweakness- homework problems could be paced better, as it felt like all the homework was assigned only after spring break "

            "\u00a0Probably not. The content is interesting and the book is excellent, but the professor was unclear in his delivery of the information. I often felt like I would have been better off reading the textbook than attending class. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. It was interesting material to learn and useful concepts to think about if the student was interested. However, if the student did not need to take a course, the material could also be learned independently. ",
