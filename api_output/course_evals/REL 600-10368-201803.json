            "\u00a0I want to highlight Calli's willingness to engage with our work and thoughts out of class (inviting us to office hours, looking over rough drafts, etc.), and how she handled discussions in the latter half of the course. I thought her mediation of our discussions had greatly improved after a rocky start. In particular, her willingness to push individuals on their thoughts became a very useful tool to facilitate further conversation. Offering one critique; sometimes conversation would fizzle and we would not have any guidance back towards conversation. I do appreciate that these moments were sometimes used for silence and giving us time to think. But, sometimes I think people just needed a good question to get conversation going again. ",
            "\u00a0It was such a pleasure having Calli as a TF. She truly went above and beyond helping me work through my thoughts for my papers. She did not offer to help us with our work, she insisted that we use her as a resource. I saw my relationship with her as one of true mentorship - she really wanted me to learn and improve. I also received high grades on all assignments, and I was thankful that she spent time with me ensuring that my writing became even better. \r\n\r\nI am taking a class in the spring just because she said she will be a TF. ",
            "\u00a0Calli focused on building skills that students could use in this course and in other courses at Yale. For example, focusing on argument and argument structures is an essential skill builder, and good practice for the even the most seasoned student. ",
            "\u00a0Calli did an excellent job facilitating discussions and creating a space where people felt comfortable speaking up. She asked good questions and explained materials well when clarification was needed. Calli also made herself available to students outside of class for one-on-one assistance. ",
            "\u00a0Calli is well read and was able to navigate us through the often deep grounds of theological considerations. The ways in which she explained and engaged with us regarding written pieces were a cut above the rest. ",
            "\u00a0Calli was incredibly helpful when we had specific questions. She helped us gear our papers to be in the desired format. ",
            "\u00a0She was good at presenting the material as interesting, and helped clarify the assignments. I wish she would have stepped up more during section, in order to correct some of our musings about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Calli was helpful and supportive. She was consistently willing to guide us as we dissected dense readings, and answer clarifying questions about our essays. My one note is that I wasn't particularly fond of her tendency to have us search for specific quotes or vague points in the readings - a practice which was both time consuming and relatively unproductive. All said, however, I appreciated Calli's presence and efforts. ",
            "\u00a0Calli is extremely helpful and patient. She was always willing to meet outside of class to discuss papers or readings. Our section was one of my favorite things this semester! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Adapts to feedback, provides constructive feedback on assignments, responsive & sets us up for success. Great in 1:1 situations.\r\n\r\nAreas to improve: I'd suggest that Calli think about what kind of teacher she wants to be, and to have that reflected in section. She can then use that to help her set the tone during the first few weeks of a given semester. Our expectations and experience will be greatly influenced by the environment that we step into during that period. ",
            "\u00a0Calli pushed me to think outside of the theological spheres I had become accustomed to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--expertise in course material, graciousness toward all participants, extremely available one-on-one to help students learn individually\r\nWeaknesses--It took us a few weeks to get discussions off the ground; not a lot of skill in asking questions to prompt student thought; but this got better as the course went on and she gained more confidence. Calli's only real weakness was inexperience and I think her teaching is going to get much stronger simply with practice. ",
            "\u00a0Calli is extremely helpful and always willing to meet you outside of the class. I have never had an occurrence where Calli was not approachable or willing to help. Calli is a great TF and made my time in the class enjoyable and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Janna was a great TF. She always had a plan for section and opened up the discussion to individual questions. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked Janna and thought she was a very helpful TF. Again, as someone who has never taken a theology course, Janna was very willing to sit with me and talk through the vocabulary of theology. She provided helpful and thoughtful feedback on all of my assignments--both large and small--to the extent that I feel as though her feedback genuinely helped me become a better writer and scholar of theology throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like that it took a very long time for grades to be posted, and they were posted long after Janna told us they were going to be. At the time I am writing this, a grade for a short paper turned in two months ago has still not been posted, and this has been incredibly frustrating throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Janna exhibited a strong knowledge of the content, and she did a good job running classroom conversations. ",
            "\u00a0She's incredibly bright and kind. ",
            "\u00a0Engaged and controlled conversation well.\r\nQuestions asked did not always facilitate thought or conversation, at times the questions brought discussion to a full stop. ",
            "\u00a0Janna was wonderful. She answered questions thoroughly and was able to maintain control over and direct our conversation. She entertained ideas that weren't necessarily what she had in mind, and was able to steer the conversation in a way that made those ideas relevant and applicable. She created a non-threatening atmosphere where questions were encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0Janna is an all-star.  This was by far my favorite section this semester.  Engaging questions and ways to break up the learning visually as well.  Janna is a great discussion facilitator. ",
            "\u00a0On top of everything.\r\nShe also gave an excellent lecture.\r\nJanna is supportive and patient. When we totally have it wrong, she steers us back to the right path with consideration and respect.\r\nWe had a great family feel in our discussion section.\r\nHer written comments were clear and precise. They helped me know what to focus on for the next assignment.\r\nShe also made herself available throughout the entire semester.\r\nRock star! Academic extraordinaire! ",
            "\u00a0Janna is a remarkable teacher.  She was adept at guiding discussion in my section, even though the students in my section were coming into the class from very, very different intellectual backgrounds, and had very different kinds of competencies.  Janna was able to modulate discussion to challenge everyone while also enabling everyone to keep up.  She was patient when students didn't understand certain things, and kept her cool when discussions became heated.  She also did a very good job of designing various kinds of discussions and activities which played to the various learning styles of students in the section. ",
            "\u00a0Janna was an amazing TF and gave me helpful and important feedback and criticism on my written work, helping me to hone my writing skills and develop my theological insights. I am incredibly grateful, as Janna helped to renew my love for theology and academia. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wendy engaged and committed! She made room for everyone to speak. She solicited participant from everyone. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wendy was often unable to clearly explain concepts. I often left more confused than when I entered. Grades came back late with little feedback. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: its clear Wendy has a lot of notes to prepare herself for the class, but I think she feels nervous really leading the section, so, I would suggest she give herself a structure for the section and repeat it over the semester. My suggestion would be to consider section as part mini lecture, part discussion. I would find section far more helpful if the first 30 minutes were a more detailed review of the material given in a straightforward lecture format, covering whatever wasnt covered in lecture or reviewing a specific point in detailor if the first 30 min were taken up with technical questions from students. Then we could have 20 minutes of structured conversation around 1-2 questions of how this material impacts our lives and what we think about it.\r\n\r\nAnd on a particular basis, I would really consider having section be longer than an hour or having it twice a week. We are not doing enough discussion here at YDS. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - knowledge, availability\r\nweaknesses - only got feedback on one paper before needing to write the final paper - could not use the course to improve my writing ",
            "\u00a0Always willing to meet with students for extra help ",
            "\u00a0Gave feedback on papers very late, to the point where it wasn't helpful because I had already started or even sometimes finished the next assignment. Could have led section with stronger leadership. Her strength was throwing questions asked of her back out to the room for us to dialogue over. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy is clearly extremely intelligent and very present in our discussion sections. I did, though, sometimes leave a bit more confused than when I had walked in, or at least neutral. I think that with a bit more structure to discussion sections would be a good improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - patient in explaining material further\r\nWeaknesses - none ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was amazing. She was always available, a fair grader, and someone that I always felt comfortable speaking with. Her energy and love for material, as well as her intelligence, was an incredible gift. She was patient, efficient, and kind while still keeping a strong control on her control and authority. I respect her so much. ",
            "\u00a0What a good discussion leader! Wendy was able to make confusing things clear, and made space for us all to express our nascent theologian opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was a great teaching fellow. She was great in structuring our sessions such that we could ask questions about the lectures and readings, and usually also added an exercise  to deepen our understanding of one complicated topic. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was helpful and approachable both during sections and over email. The variety of activities she led during section, such as drawing comparison charts of theologians and having mini debates, helped us understand the material and draw connections between different things we'd read. The guidance Wendy gave us as we prepared for certain assignments, such as a section workshop for our Anselm outlines and the opportunity to create sample theses for our first paper, were valuable and welcome - especially since this Intro to Theology course was the first time some of us had studied theology. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy is incredibly knowledgeable regarding the subject material and was able to help in immense ways with advice and guidance regarding our assignments and papers. Something I think that could be improved upon is having a more concrete plan during discussion sections. Either talking specifically about a particular point in the reading or lecture I think would prove very helpful for discussion. "
