            "\u00a0I continued to deepen my love Latin, literature, and language. I honed my writing skills, specifically with regard to writing clearly and concisely. Class discussions challenged me to approach text with a keener eye for detail and meaning. ",
            "\u00a0My Latin translation skills have improved.  My ability to read literature on a more meaningful level has also grown better. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to strengthening Latin reading skills by reading almost 100 lines per class, this class also built analytical skills and fostered an appreciation of Ovid's verse. This class has it all. You will write papers that demand concision and careful removal of all fluff, learn first-hand the difficult task of polished translation, and read over 2,000 lines of Ovid over this semester. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth analysis of selections from Ovids metamorphoses, with a view to understanding what is peculiar about Ovids style and major themes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course has been the highlight of my experience at Yale thus far. I have no recommendations for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0With only 8 students in the class, everyone felt very comfortable volunteering their ideas for discussion, and everyone was very engaged with the course material. Classes were so action-packed that things never got boring, but I never felt unable to raise my hand and ask a question for fear of slowing the class down and causing us to not finish what we had planned to do for the day. ",
            "\u00a0The class struck a right amount of balance between translation and discussion on the text. Very sharp insights from both the professor and students. There were times when Prof Solodow would translate vast chunks of the text by himself, and I wasnt quite sure what the pedagogical value was. All in all, Ive left with a much enhanced understanding of Ovidian style, as well as putting Ovid in the context of the Augustan age. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student with even slightest interest in Latin. It is a wonderful overview of a magnificent, witty, and beautiful poem that has shaped my appreciation for literature more generally. It is well-taught, engaging, and deeply fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely worth taking. Tough but fair, Solodow is a master of the Metamorphoses and engages students through critical discussion, comparative essays, and personal translations of the stories. Moving at a quick pace, this class is not one to be taken lightly, but you will likely be so enthralled as to lose yourself within the Metamorphoses and gain a deeper perspective on them, and Ovid himself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class.  The course material is interesting and fairly accessible, and the in-class discussions were engaging and illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other Yale students, prospective Classics majors or otherwise. When I entered the class, I did not even particularly love Ovid, but over the course of the term, Dr. Solodow's passion for Ovid became extraordinarily contagious. Be prepared to work hard and get a lot from your hard work. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a fan of Ovid, this is the course for you. If you want to read a poem that is epic-elegiac-tragic-comic-grotesque-rhetoric all in one, take this class. Or if you want to learn about the Latin particle quidem. By the end of the course, though, I felt myself growing a little tired of Ovid. Great class overall! "
