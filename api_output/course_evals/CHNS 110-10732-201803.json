            "\u00a0From knowing zero Chinese, I learned so much. I am confident enough to start a quick conversation with a Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of Chinese culture. I learned 500 vocabulary words, dozens of sentence patterns, and also the pronunciation of Chinese words. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the chinese language and Chinese culture ",
            "\u00a0I came in knowing absolutely nothing about the Chinese language, and after only three months I have a solid understanding of basic sentence structures, hundreds of characters memorized, and can hold a simple conversation in Chinese with someone else. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the fundementals of written and spoken chinese. i feel that i learned a lot of chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic grammar and vocabulary needed to have short conversations in Chinese, as well as about the culture of the Chinese people. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese significantly improved over the course of the term. Character retention in particular improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic Chinese vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar, as well as a important useful phrases. This class is level 1, for beginners, so don't expect to master the whole Chinese language in just this one class, but I felt that the information we were learning was all very useful and applicable, especially since the textbook dialogues are typically about college life, the topics covered are very pertinent. The first couple of weeks we really focused on Pinyin and tones, which is difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, it isn't so bad. The class is set up this way so that you have a strong foundation in proper pronunciation from the start. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: class was very well-structured, fostering a great environment to learn. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that the professors care so much and are highly engaged.  One weakness is that grades are not recorded on Canvas, so it can be difficult at times to know exactly where you stand until the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It's overall very strong ",
            "\u00a0Many portions of the class are focused solely on memorization (evident with reciting dialogues). The course could be improved if it were to move away from this assessment and instead focus on more rigorous drilling of the language. ",
            "\u00a0A small classroom size gave us a more personalized education with direct feedback on our pronounciation and speaking skills. Meeting everyday put us in a routine of practicing Chinese often so we wouldnt easily forget the lessons. There arent any weaknesses that come to mind about this course. ",
            "\u00a0this class relies too heavily on memorization. more one on one feedback on spoken chinese would be valuble ",
            "\u00a0This course was a huge amount of work,  but the grading system was often vague and difficult to use, so it was hard to track the progress I made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is highly engaging, always interesting, and learning a new language is pretty fun! The teachers are super helpful and really try to get their students to understand the concepts. In addition to being a good instructor, Shen Laoshi is very engaging and she tells fun anecdotes to help you remember. I found her teaching style highly enjoyable.\r\nWeaknesses: Yes, this class is everyday, and yes you have homework everyday, and yes the daily quizzes are kind of annoying, but I really didn't mind any of it. I felt highly motivated to do work for this class because it was so fun for me, but I could see how it would be a bother if you really didn't care for the class. Having this class everyday helped me stay on top of my semester because it was a constant in my schedule. The homework helps you practice the new structures that were taught in class that day, and it is really manageable. The hardest homeworks were the workbook translations that are normally assigned at the end of a chapter, but other than that, it is really straightforward. The daily quizzes were a bit annoying, but they are graded pretty leniently. Even if you forget how to write the character you can still get at least a 9/10. My only real complaint is about the oral presentations. I don't think they were a good evaluation of how well you understood the chapter material because it is just memorization. You are just reciting the dialogue. But I think their purpose is to evaluate your pronunciation more than anything else, and if you are somewhat okay at memorization you will be perfectly fine. "

            "\u00a0Yes definitely. It is a new experience compared to other non-language classes that are all taught in English. It is very challenging but helps you learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you need to take a language and are interested in learning Chinese.  Otherwise, probably not the ideal course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if theyre passionate about learning Chinese. It takes a lot of commitment and effort to do well in this course. Theres daily homework and preparation for the next days quiz and lesson that one needs to complete. If they arent going to set aside a few hours a day to study the language then I wouldnt recommend taking it. However if they are passionate, then this course will only make you like the language even more, its an extremely rewarding course! ",
            "\u00a0no, its too much work. dont do it. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn chinese, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. However, I would only recommend this course to students who are truly interested in learning Chinese and would be willing to dedicate a lot of time and effort into studying the language. Of all the classes I've taken, this has been the best example of getting out what you're putting in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Yale's Chinese program truly is amazing and one of the best language-learning experiences I have ever had. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! This class was my favorite class all semester and I absolutely loved it. It also made me feel so proud of myself to see how much I had learned in just one semester. If you are considering taking Chinese, do not be afraid. People say this class is hard, but if you put in the effort, it will be more than worth your time! As someone who enjoys learning new languages, this class was perfect for me, but if languages aren't your thing, you can still succeed in this class, but you might not enjoy it as much. One thing that made a surprisingly big impact was the other students in my class. At the beginning of the semester, our class had more students than the other sections, so two people had to be sent to other instructors' sections that were taught at the same time. Nobody in our class wanted to leave! It was sad to see two of our classmates go! Because the sections are so small, you really get to know the other students in your section as well as the teacher. I think the fact that no one wanted to switch sections is a testament to how much we all liked Shen Laoshi as our instructor. The other students in the class make such a big impact because you get to share parts of your life with each other while communicating (or attempting to) in Chinese. One day I woke up late and I missed my section and went to a later section to make it up, and I noticed that I wasn't having as much fun as I do in my own section which was surprising because the later section was also taught by Shen Laoshi. Of course at the time my illogical brain concluded that the other section was boring because the students were boring, but now I think it was just because I didn't know any of the students in that class so maybe I wasn't as invested in what they were sharing. This stood out to me because I originally thought that the reason I liked Chinese class so much was because I really liked the teacher. I think the teacher still plays a big part, but it hadn't occurred to me that my classmates also unknowingly motivated me as well. Basically, what I am trying to say is that I really liked Chinese class, I really liked my instructor, and I really liked my classmates and this created a perfect storm of motivators that made this class incredibly enjoyable. For some added perspective, I was unsure about choosing Chinese as a language to study this semester, and I was considering taking Korean instead. I shopped both Korean 1 and Chinese 1 for all of shopping week, and what determined my decision was how I felt in the classroom. Other students and the reviews on course table say that Korean is easier than Chinese in almost every aspect, so I was unsure about the workload for Chinese. But ultimately, because I felt more comfortable in my Chinese class, I think I made the right decision and the workload became a nonissue. Both classes are a lot of work, I know because my roommate took Korean 1, but because I was enjoying the work, it didn't feel like work. If this isn't enough to convince another student, as an added bonus, you get to follow along the adventures of Wang Peng and Li You all semester. The hilarious textbook videos alone are enough to make this class worth taking! "
