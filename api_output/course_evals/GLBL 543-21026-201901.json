            "\u00a0Understanding the different steps and challenges throughout conducting a statistical research project. ",
            "\u00a0Intermediate to advanced coding skills in Stata ",
            "\u00a0Extremely increased understanding of what \"data analysis\" means--particularly descriptive statistics.  Also made me much, much more confident in my ability to use Stata as a tool to execute analyses based on social inquiries. ",
            "\u00a0How to organize large data sets, how to manage data in general, and how to use stata ",
            "\u00a0Preparing data to be analyzed, using STATA to implement analysis methods, and what to do when data is not in an \"ideal\" form (which is a lot of the time). ",
            "\u00a0how to code in STATA and to think about data ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about coding with Stata and, to my surprise, about coding in general. The class is designed in a way that encourages students to think of the most effective paths to results, regardless of the coding language they are using. I learned to approach problems systemically, to cover all my bases in the most rigorous way possible, and to troubleshoot like a pro. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the Stata software package. Primarily, I learned how to manipulate and clean big datasets. I also learned how to evaluate data. "

            "\u00a0Strengths include very practical and helpful material as well as an engaging instructor. The assignments were sometimes frustrating in that the key to resolving them might have been discussed in the following lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Stata is a valuable skill to learn and the course teaches how do complex analysis of large datasets. Hard to get in touch with instructor or get additional help outside of class. Lecture format is useful--students follow along command line by command line and notes are provided by instructor after each class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n    o Instructor engagement with students--always available to help us and flexible on assignment due dates based off of the course's tempo\r\n    o Tailor-made research project: this was the primary reason I took this course and helped me contextualize every lesson\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n     o The actual length of each class is too long.  Even if this an SOM-specific thing, it's simply not effective for ensuring student attention and retention.  Would strongly advocate for a twice-a-week model of 1 hour 15 minutes.  The length also leads to complacency with the class's tempo: often felt like we wouldn't get to the parts of class relevant to completing problem sets until the last 20 minutes of class because we'd taken our time in the first hour and a half.\r\n     o Problem sets--very often felt like they were several orders of difficulty above what we'd learned in class.  Recommendation for this: make students perform more often in the classroom to ensure development of skills necessary for problem set mastery; keep the hard questions in the classroom and let the problem sets be a basic check on learning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal of STATA from this course, which has been one of the most beneficial skills I will take from my masters. A weakness is that since there is a lot to cover, the volume of information did get a bit overwhelming. Practice does make things easier, but having video recordings would have been so helpful for this course. I would love to have had the freedom to go back to video recordings after class and remember what the context behind the syntax was. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the way the Professor designed his problem sets. They helped corroborate what we learned in class, and gave us enough room to do some experimenting of our own. I also appreciated the amount of time the Professor spent working with us one-on-one. It allowed us to tailor our individual projects to best suit our interests and existing skillsets.\r\nOne possible improvement I could think of is for the lesson material to be posted a few days before each class. We sometimes covered a huge amount of knowledge in one single class, and it became a touch difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the interactive class experience. I think the weaknesses were the lack of available TAs, the single class session rather than two per week, and the lack of repetitive assignments. It was difficult to get help on assignments as there was only one TA that I don't think had office hours. As there was only one class and about one assignment per week with a few difficult questions, I don't feel like I got the kind of repetitive learning reinforcement that I needed to get these hard skills to stick. By the next class session, I felt like I had forgotten most of what I had learned in the previous session. "

            "\u00a0Yes, for those interested in working with large datasets, Stata is a valuable skill to have. This course provides a lot of in-class time coding which is useful for learning the software. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--but only if they either a) need to know how to use Stata or b) are passionately interested in conducting a personal research project and have the time to look for the right data sources.  If a student cannot satisfy either of these requirements, I would say that this course is still relevant for gaining an appreciation for experimental design...but would consume a large amount of time that they might not be intrinsically motivated to spend.

            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this to other students. In fact, I would recommend that they take this class as soon as possible. Some of my program-mates decided to take the course during their second year, after they sit a class on two on econometrics. I have a feeling that having some hands-on experience with qualitative work would help put things in perspective, and allow the student to choose a statistical theory class that best suits them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would tell them to start the assignments early and seek out online practice to reinforce the skills. "
