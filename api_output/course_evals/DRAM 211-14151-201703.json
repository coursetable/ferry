            "\u00a0The syllabus was very wordy and it was difficult to quickly discern the difference between readings, questions to be answered, and questions to prepare to discuss in class. \r\n\r\nThe class was almost entirely lecture, and I struggled to make my voice heard and answer questions. Often, Greg would pose a question to the class and only one student would have a chance to respond before Greg finished answering the question. I often felt I had to interrupt Greg to participate in a discussion or share my thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to concentrate without any visual elements or handouts for a 3 hour class on Fridays. I would have appreciated powerpoint slides, hand outs, discussions in pairs, and more interactive projects in class. ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the course felt a bit like reading a textbook, but perhaps that is because it is harder to use real-world examples of governance, so much of which takes place behind closed doors. "

            "\u00a0Again, if the class included more student discussion, hand outs, powerpoints, or other methods of learning aside from a straight lecture, the pacing would be better and the quality of presentation would be stronger. It's easy to check out when it's difficult to speak up and interact in the class and when there are no visual or written components. ",
            "\u00a0Greg needs to be more careful around EDI issues. When he brings it up, he tends to speak with a slight air of authority from his experience, when in fact, the best thing to do with EDI issues is to listen to them closely. It may be better to allow the class to bring up EDI questions on their own, or let them mention it and then ask question, rather than to comment on it directly "

            "\u00a0Without any handouts, it will be more difficult to retain information. It would be nice to have some sort of handout with the 5 principles of governance with a summary of each for reference. ",
            "\u00a0Our final presentation was judged as a presentation before the board. In and of itself, that was fine, and the class did well, but it made me wish we had talked a little more about presenting to a board. "
