            "\u00a0Professor Buschkovitch is one of the most knowledgeable historians I have ever met, on the whole of Europe not just Russian history.  It was truly amazing to learn about Russia in such a wide context.  He also teaches students to think like historians and brings back methods some may regard as old school but are critical and often forgotten today, such as knowledge of military and particularist religious history. ",
            "\u00a0One learns about the period of Russian history from 1649 to 1725 (approx.), with a particular focus on Peter the Great and his myriad cultural and administrative reforms. ",
            "\u00a0I became familiar with a region of the world and a period of history about which I knew very little. This helped me better contextualize my own research. ",
            "\u00a0General background on the relevant period of Russian history. Good breadth, if not considerable depth, but that was appropriate for the survey nature of the course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Slightly shorter readings, as I never felt like I could read them all the way through. However, I do not think Professor Bushkovitch meant us to read every word but to prioritize and do as much as we could. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course were always interesting, and I felt that I took a lot out of every seminar. The paper was enjoyable, and Professor Bushkovitch is a world-class teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Good discussion of historiography and the trends within the discipline. Some reading on the syllabus was originally in Russian and was replaced over the course of the semester. Hard to access some of the books (borrow direct/ILL is slow and unpredictable, few physical copies of some books on Yale's campus). Could scan relevant pages and provide through Canvas. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Bushkovitch is an interesting instructor and has a wonderful dry sense of humor. I feel like I understand Russian history much more now, as well as the Eastern Orthodox church ironically. ",
            "\u00a0If Professor Bushkovitch offers this seminar again, I would recommend that students interested in Russia or Europe more generally take this course. It is intimate, which offers room for interesting and illuminating conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Excellent entry point to Early Modern Russian history. "
