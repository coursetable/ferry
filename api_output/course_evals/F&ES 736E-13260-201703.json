            "\u00a0As a student in humanities, I hear the voice from natural scientists. This inter-disciplinary approach is a huge boost for my research. I understand more on the responsibility of humanities, and the urgency to convey the ethical issue to the public. The shared concern on the environmental concern is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different ethical frameworks to use to approach environmental policy problems. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn about the broad concepts within environmental ethics, a topic I had never had the opportunity to study before. I was also able to analyze how these ethics topics are utilized and/or applied in real-world environmental decision-making. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped add to my critical thinking skill set as well as opened my eyes to other frameworks/approached to ethics at the interface of humanity and nature. ",
            "\u00a0A greater appreciation for the ethical issues inherent to problems/topics in environmental studies. I also saw how these issues link to the science behind environmental studies and how science may be able to help us grapple with ethical dilemmas.\r\n\r\nI had not fully appreciated how ethical issues impact policy and whether we are able or not to strike agreements around environmental issues, how they shape people's thinking and their judgments and why they may hold us back from making progress if we don't address them. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of Environmental Ethics, different ethical frameworks and biases ",
            "\u00a0it was great to get me thinking about new perspectives on ethical questions ",
            "\u00a0I learned how ethical considerations enter into environmental issues and decisions. Also, how there is not a right answer but rather it is important to engage in conversations about ethical matters. This promotes the skill of critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good class to think through the history of environmental ethics and different issues that arise in doing environmental work. "

            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained in the class aligned with all of my expectations for the course. I was able to delve into certain ethics topics that I did have exposure to beforehand. I left the class with a wide knowledge of certain topics in environmental ethics and how they apply to real-world environmental decision-making. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely exceeded my expectations -- from the open-ended online forum to the in-class discussions and reactions to one another to the fun, stimulating debate to the phenomenal presentations and beyond! ",
            "\u00a0See above. I not only now appreciate the ethical issues embedded in environmental topics but the course gave me ways to think about how to do something about that, how to help people align around solutions, how to elucidate and address the ethical issues in a cooperative way. I learned that there are ways to do that if people are sensitive to the fact that these ethical dilemmas exist and not all humans see things from the same perspective. ",

            "\u00a0This class fell quite short of my expectations. While the materials were all good, I expected our in-class sessions to be more weighty, to engage in actual dialogues and conversations, given that we were anyways watching lecture videos outside of class. As it was, our group presentations and final debate didn't really seem to grapple with any issues - each side just stated a position and that was about it. I realize the class is limited time-wise, but thought this class had a lot of promise that it did not deliver on. "

            "\u00a0The major strength of the course was the broad coverage of the most important environmental topics. Having the students apply these topics in a debate and end of semester presentation was also really helpful. I cannot think of any way that the class could be improved. I enjoyed it very much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included the professor's openness about the highs and lows of academia and research as they relate to ethics (and the environment) as well as the other students' engagement with the material and one another's opinions.  I can't think of any weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include Michelle's style as she is great at describing the issues, their importance and then stimulating good discussion around them. I also liked the variety of materials - online lectures, in-class lectures, group discussions, group work and presentations, readings. Really good.\r\n\r\nNot sure I can offer suggestions for improvement as I liked the class a lot. I learned even more than I thought I would, saw some inter-disciplinary links as well. Could the course benefit from having an exam? Maybe. That would be one suggestion. Or have one or two homework exercises. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be extended to a full semester to cover more material, not enough time to engage ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Content on Canvas. Very good videos, including the interviews, and readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Limited time for discussions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topics, great professor in terms of engaging the class and having interesting personal stories to tell\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of clear focus or guiding themes for the course, lack of ways to really connect outside reading and lectures with in-class discussions, lack of true discussions in class. Seems like a disservice to the whole concept of environmental ethics\r\n\r\nImprovements: Rather than this being an \"easy-pass\" 2 credit course, maybe this should be a full-blown course with actual expectations and thought-provoking assignments and discussions.

This one-hour-a-week, discussion-based course will challenge you to think in new ways and with various lenses at some of the most critical, time-sensitive questions of our generation about the environment and us = humans! ",

And the subject matter is not easy in the sense that these are very tricky issues to address in the real world. So don't think this is a no brainer. It is not technical, per se, but very relevant and interesting. The non-technical issues in life are usually the ones that trip us humans up ... ",

            "\u00a0If you're looking for an easy class to fill your schedule, this could be a way to get some little exposure to environmental ethics. The readings and videos are good and interesting, as is the professor. However, don't expect to get too much out of the course unless they overhaul it - given that it's so short, you really barely get to have any interesting discussions or touch on topics in class in any real way.
