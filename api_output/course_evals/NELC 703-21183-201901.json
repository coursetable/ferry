            "\u00a0It is super well-structured, so youll know what youre expected to learn. Professor Fraade is an excellent lecturer, so youll learn a lot from him when he speaks. Discussion periods are maybe over-structured. Professor Fraade attempts to let them develop naturally, but the points he wants to make usually end up dominating the time. The readings are usually kept pretty short, which means you can really dive into them. If you like going deep into texts, this class will appeal to you. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the syllabus was very clear and organized. I appreciated the days when the class would be discussion- rather than lecture-based, although the lectures were very good and helpful too.\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm study guide is excessively long, especially for a test with so few questions. I understand the need for there to be more questions than on the actual test, but the final study guide was much more reasonable in that regard. "
