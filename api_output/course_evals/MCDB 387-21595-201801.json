            "\u00a0You learn about the regulation of the cell cycle and how the information has been discovered through various types of research techniques throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my first exposure to really understanding the details of the cell cycle and its regulators. I gained experience breaking down and presenting complex research and thinking about how to design experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various pathways in the cell cycle and how they fit together. I also improved various skills like reading scientific literature and designing experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I developed in depth knowlege of the cell cycle, how to read scientific papers, and how to write a grant proposal ",

            "\u00a0It is a good class that is good at getting students to learn about how to read biological papers and what to take away from it. Presenting with a partner was a good idea. Possibly focusing more on the methods of the experiments a little more when presenting papers would be beneficial for the final research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that the course was based around presenting journal articles - it would be great if we dedicated more time to practicing designing experiments like we did toward the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course generally did a really good job. The final paper though was very difficult because I hadnt written a paper like that before and not much guidance was given. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches some very cool concepts but could be better organized. I wish that at the beginning of class, there would be more chalkboard explanations. It is hard to follow along when other people are reading, but when you are assigned a paper, it makes sense. I think a better overview of what the main ideas are in each article would have helped us follow along more. "

            "\u00a0It's a good class for a MCDB seminar, you learn a lot about the cell cycle and how this relates to cancer and various types of diseases and what can go wrong so it is very applicable to current research. The paper at the end involves a fair amount of work so if you take this class be ready for that. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good if you're interested in the cell cycle! For those who aren't very interested in the cell cycle, the cell cycle can be super complicated and it takes a lot to understand the papers we read in class (at least it did for me). Also, the paper at the end was so tough - it is one thing to read and review research articles, and another thing entirely to write one of your own. It is a good challenge if that is what you like, but otherwise it can be stressful. Professor Dawson is very kind, though, and a good professor. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the cell cycle, then take it! Beware of the final paper though! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely reccommend this class to another student as I gained so much knowlege and insight. "
