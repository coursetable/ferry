            "\u00a0Lots of practical thinking - how things work in life and how hard some decisions are (with various different pieces of the picture moving at the same time) ",
            "\u00a0As most know, the GS track requires a lot of engagement in and out of the class. I really appreciated this semester's focus on tangible skills and contemporary issues. I learned a lot by working with the practitioner and the process of writing and re-writing a policy brief is one that has been helpful in all of my other coursework. The oral policy briefings were a bit daunting and overwhelming, but after doing it, I felt a lot more confident in every presentation I've given since. I'm very happy that I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0The second semester of GS was so much fun, and really opened my eyes to the concept of \"practice\" and the challenges of administering a grand strategy in an imperfect world or setting. From the modules with practitioners, to the briefings, to the crisis simulation, I've learned so much about implementation of theory, and how hard it truly is, and how we must be flexible to work around obstacles and barriers that may arise along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a lot about working with groups and also a lot about the strategy of social organizing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to formulate grand strategy in different contexts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The research component and the dinners were the highlights. The seminar on social movements could have been more focused on strategy rather than history. The strategy briefings were great. The simulation had no academic value rather than being stressed for the sake of it. Most of the benefits I got from the course were self driven. I learned from my research and papers, but not necessarily from the lectures or seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: practitioners, good discussions and the close knit community. ",
            "\u00a0presentation skills should not be such a major part of a Yale class. It makes this course feel like superficial preparation for powerful positions. Overall, the briefing format is not very useful for exploring topics of interest to students; this project should not take up half a semester. Modules are interesting, and it's great to meet people working in foreign policy. However, the class has a pretentious attitude that it can teach students to tackle any problem. Incoming students need to be very critical of Charles Hill. ",
            "\u00a0Improve strategy briefings structure ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of the second semester was that we were discussing contemporary issues. The first semester, while interesting and important, was not my biggest area of interest. I appreciated that we built off the first semester and applied GS perspective to modern political issues. Definitely maintain the practitioner aspect, but I would plan out the lessons a bit more. Sometimes it felt that we were wandering a bit without a clear end in mind... Ironic for GS. \r\n\r\nRe the policy briefs - I realize that term schedules will differ year to year. But please keep in mind if groups are having to turn in policy briefs over breaks. There were at least 2 groups that had to turn them in over October break and then again over Thanksgiving break. Not only was this a logistical nightmare, it seemed unfair. It might make more sense to ensure that single groups aren't faced with this disadvantage twice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dynamic activities throughout the course as it is broken into three parts; Thorough and community-building, as many of the segments of this course were divided into smaller groups\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Fewer opportunities to meet and discuss as a full class ",
            "\u00a0I think somehow reworking the second half of the semester would be good. It felt like kind of a waste of time that we watched 4 weeks worth of other peoples' presentations since honestly most of us were not paying the closest attention to them. The first half of the semester was AWESOME, especially in Wolfson's module, so it'd be so much better if we could spend more time in modules.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think we got really good feedback during the strategy briefings and on our term papers. Honestly, it's very clear that Gage and Johnson put a lot of work into this program despite it not necessarily being in their academic areas of expertise at all times. They really put in the work to make this program feel meaningful to us. ",
            "\u00a0The modules are well structured so that I can learn about how practitioners think. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the professors and the students. The weakness was the spacing of the workload. There should not have been reading responses due the week that the paper was due. Also, papers should not have been due over breaks. The first presentation should not have been the Monday after fall break. ",
            "\u00a0Welcome. Thanks for checking the fall reviews like I asked. I didnt leave a review in the spring because I wanted to see if the first semester made more sense as part of a coherent whole. In the \"Would you recommend this to another student\" section, you will find my full Official Course Review. It's fairly comprehensive and honest; I like to think it's how John Gaddis and (especially) Charlie Hill would review Grand Strategy. I included a few suggested changes in case Professors Gage and Johnson read it, but primarily it's for prospective applicants who don't know upperclassmen that have taken it already. The short version is: half the readings for the spring should be removed AND the seminar should replace the lecture (or the lecture should be much less background and much more analysis); the summer is better than the fall, which is better than the spring; dinners are fabulous; the scope of the course is far too large; they give you about $3-4k to do summer research; practitioners are knowledgeable but don't be suckered in by big names if you're realistically not going to take advantage of your proximity. Mostly, this class feels like an institution, but you shouldn't apply just because it's flashy and requires an application and is *competitive* so you know it has to be good. It can be really cool at times and you can meet really cool people, but there are also real downsides. I'd probably still apply if I had to do it over again, so I guess you should too, but this way hopefully you know what you're applying to. Check the full review for more details. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fascinating and very instructive but I think it could stand to move more towards using Grand Strategy in contexts other than great power conflict, as it has started to do with teaching about the grand strategy of mass movements. "

            "\u00a0yes, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No, I don't think \"grand strategy\" constitutes a coherent subject matter for a course. Take courses that analyze how the world works, and the origins of the issues you're passionate about. That will better prepare you to \"strategize.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes, GS has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Yale, and the second semester is far more interesting than the first. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students because of the experience that G.S. offers. Not only does it create an intense syllabus of literature and theory, but it also creates a space to put such theory into action--through summer projects where students can study topics of their own personal choice, by having thorough class discussion with senior practitioners in different fields, and through our very own briefing groups. But more than that, G.S. creates a community of ambitious, driven students unlike any other. By the second semester, this community becomes tight-knit, and becomes a family, and that is something special all on its own. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in, consider the opportunities. Reflecting on the year, I didn't learn much in the spring semester and learned far more in the fall. Fall semester is actually really cool - you will learn a lot about your project area for your strategy briefing, and the modules are an opportunity to learn from amazing practitioners who are doing the type of work you want to do one day. However, the culture of the program is very important, and I think a lot of students got complacent second semester and either did no work at all or dropped the program. Despite having credit d'd the class, I was on the harder working side. I had a great group for my strategy briefing and genuinely enjoyed the discussions in class. The opportunity to go to dinners every week and the summer funding are also really clutch. Yeah, think closely about the perks of this class when deciding if you want to devote 2 credits (plus a LOT of extra time outside of class) to the program.\r\n\r\nBut also, that being said, you don't want to take this class just because it's selective. The kids who did that all ended up ghosting the program in the fall semester or dropping it entirely. It's not worth it. You're already smart and impressive, you don't need this as a line item on your resume to make yourself more impressive, and you probably won't make connections through the program that you can capitalize on later unless you're a true gunner. Take the class because you WANT to, not because you think you should. ",
            "\u00a0yes it's very valuable to both learn the history of some decision-making and then apply it in the second semester work, which makes you more humble about how hard it is ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in leadership and strategy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to put in the work. It is an amazing opportunity, but a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0OFFICIAL REVIEW (CERTIFIED FRESH)\r\n\r\nSpring Semester:\r\nThey are trying to expand the focus of the program beyond national security in order to broaden its appeal, but the result is that it now has wide appeal (lots of people applied) and zero focus. Before the revamp, it is my understanding that Grand Strategy was about grand strategy. Now, they've redefined it so that it's about strategies for big things. The line they use is \"how to use limited means in service of unlimited ends,\" so. Lectures should either be scrapped entirely or fundamentally changed. The typical lecture was 20 minutes of background information about the author, then 20 minutes of vague descriptions of the major themes or plot points of the readings, then 20 minutes of what we hoped to talk about in section that week, then 15 minutes of questions. Rarely did the lectures provide penetrating analysis or cover much new ground. \r\nSections were worse, as would be expected of a 75-minute discussion on all of Thucydides, or (true story) Kant, Rousseau, the Federalist Papers, the UN Charter, and the charter of the League of Nations (again, in 75 minutes). Also, I'm not sure if this is all history seminars or what, but people use words like \"tension\" and \"logics\" and \"unpack\" unironically. Very little is prescriptive or even arguably analytical. Most comments are people saying that a certain passage reminded them of another passage or theme in another work. It seems like little philosophical or normative argumentation occurred in Gage's section, whereas Garsten's was more rigorous but rarely referenced any readings. It is difficult to say that you get more from the seminars than you would get from reading the Wikipedia summaries of the assigned readings. I dont think I learned anything from the first (spring) semester, because basically all the discussions were \"Do X, but don't do it too much\" and you're like well yeah I know I'm supposed to do X, the hard part is figuring out how much is too much. You never figure it out.\r\nThe dinners, on the other hand, are great, and you should go to all of them.\r\n\r\nSummer:\r\nThey gave us no information about what we would have to produce using our summer research. They said we would have to write a paper, but did not say what kind, or how long, or when. Thats kind of annoying because it can be difficult to conduct research without knowing what the research will be used for.  In the fall, we learned that the options were 1) strategy briefing paper, 2) journal for a Foreign Affairs-style serious magazine, or 3) academic paper. They give you a lot of money, like around $3,000-4,000, and you can do stuff you would never have done otherwise, which is pretty cool. Most people do 2 weeks in Western Europe. Fun.\r\n\r\nFall Semester:\r\nFall was as follows: Six-week seminar with a practitioner, then the first round of strategy briefing presentations, then the second round, then the crisis simulation.\r\nThe initial seminar is cool, but be wary of falling into the same trap as the first semester, where you spend a lot of time on huge unanswerable questions and dont learn anything. Most people enjoyed their modules I think, and the practitioners are very smart.\r\nThe briefings can be challenging. Two or three groups were flambed by Charlie Hill, whose mission it is to destroy the weak. You present to [Gaddis or Hill], [Johnson or Gage], and an outside expert. The 3 of them ask all sorts of random questions to simulate a real briefing environment. Its a good experience in some ways, in that you get to really see how hard it is to work with other people and present an airtight case. You also have the opportunity to learn a lot from the outside expert. I dont think they give people bad grades in this class, so while it can be unpleasant in the moment, your GPA will probably be fine.\r\n\r\nOther: We were paired up with World Fellows. They can be great (I loved mine), but many people abandon theirs b/c of time constraints.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. "
