            "\u00a0Theories and practices of resistance, mostly within the twentieth century, with an emphasis on the connections resistors created across generations, borders, causes, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about resistance in today's era means, compared with other historical examples. ",
            "\u00a0This course delved into the many forms and facets of \"resistance\" throughout history ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different theories of violence/non-violence of resistance movements and European histories of resistance, mostly against fascist regimes. ",
            "\u00a0How to discuss theory ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting - not just about current resistance, so this course was really good for a theoretical overview of how resistance came to be. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was perhaps the best example of a cross-listed course that I've taken at Yale. Students of history, sociology, American studies, etc were all represented, and many students came to the class with a personal stake in learning about resistance in contemporary contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths abound. Weaknesses may include more on the part of making sure that all the students participate in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings of the course could benefit from being moved to a later time in the day, as most folks seemed tired during the class and it brought down the general level of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really good overall. It was well structured, well taught and well facilitated. Professor Renaud was great and gave really good feedback.\r\nCould be improved with more diverse readings - more by people of colour and from other regions of the world (Asia, Africa, Latic America specifically) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the discussion is incredibly well-lead, readings are manageable and interesting, seminar is structured well. Professor Renaud provides meaningful and constructive comments on all of your written assignments and genuinely cares about helping his students become better writers. I cannot think of many weaknesses of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions always tended to be extremely slow and not very engaging, for two main reasons: 1) the discussion questions raised by the professor were not very stimulating because they were meant to just make sure we understood the main points of the reading; and 2) most people did not participate in the discussion and kept quiet. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Renaud is caring and very very intelligent which impacts the class a lot, class reading was very manageable \r\n\r\nWeakness: class discussion was slow at times because people wouldnt talk - most probably because it was a very early 9am class so people had just woken up but I would urge professor Renaud to call on people next time ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings for this course, and discussion was always very interesting. I also found the workload to be very fair, especially for a seminar. In terms of improvement, I know that the professor is most familiar with Western (and especially German) thought, but it would be interesting for the readings to branch out and cover the philosophy of resistance from a more diverse, international perspective.

            "\u00a0Take this class! Excellent syllabus and excellent teacher. You could be interested in just one or two of the modules (each week has a different theme), and find your interest greatly expanded by the connections across modules. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100% ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! This is a really good course with an amazing professor! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Resistance Theory and Practice. Professor Renaud is a gem - super good at leading discussion, gave very helpful feedback, and organized the class really well. We cover a wide breadth of resistance movements and theories but mostly focus on 20th century Eastern Europe (because that is Professor Renaud's speciality). The semester was well organized, and so was each class. We would start with a student presentation, followed by Q&A, then class discussion. There is a fair amount of paper writing, but overall it was a reasonable amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the chance to take this class, absolutely do. One of the very rare seminars where the professor knows how to steer conversation away from seminar a**holes and performative speaking. Instead you will engage deeply with the course readings (which are great and manageable) and learn a lot from your classmates. Assignments are fun and definitely not too heavy in workload. ",
            "\u00a0This class is good not only for history majors interested in studying European history of anti-fascist resistance but also WGSS or PLSC majors who are interested in learning about theories of resistance. ",
            "\u00a0I think prof Renaud is great and would take a class to foster a relationship w him ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Renaud is really engaging, and the course material is pretty interesting. A lot of reading - some feel repetitive or hard to digest - but the class discussion supplements them well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Renaud is a great professor who knows how to lead good discussion "
