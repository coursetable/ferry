            "\u00a0I learned about three of the greatest Italian artists from the renaissance and their major works. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking and reasoning on art, connecting visual elements across objects ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning about the lives of artists at a totally different time period ",
            "\u00a0Solid understanding of the backstories of these artists' works and important themes and techniques in art (e.g., historia, terribilita, chiaroscuro) ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael--their life stories, how they interacted with each other, their influences, and a number of their works. The final paper requirement (15 pages with only about 3 sources) also pushed me to visually analyze artworks very deeply, as this paper was mostly just personal analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many Renaissance painters, with the focus being the namesake of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the lives of these great high Renaissance artists, but I learned a lot about the contextual approach to art in Italy during the late 15h century into the 16th century.  Professor Suthor also focused on not only teaching us about the works of these artists, but on the different ways which art historians go about studying and talking about these works. I'd even say the course functions as a history class on the practices of art history. The course focused on insuring that we leave with a historic understanding of the art from the high Renaissance and a solid platform from which we could study more art from other eras. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this class thoroughly and learned an incredible amount about the Renaissance period and its three most famous artists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major figures of Renaissance art, along with how they fit into their larger contexts. "

            "\u00a0This course was very interesting. I was engaged with the material that was taught. However, the organization of the class felt a little disorganized because we would jump around from artist to artist rather than learning about each artist and all of theur works at once. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very informative. The syllabus was great and I loved the material and think the readings were well selected. I think the assignments were helpful but that the course could have been a bit more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectured were a bit hard to follow and could have been more engaging ",
            "\u00a0This course is probably best carried out with two 50-minute lectures and one 50-minute section per week as was originally planned. Lecture is great for understanding the themes surrounding the works but section is needed to discuss this more in depth and in the context of the assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0The material was great, but it was not a very exciting lecture to attend--it lacked enthusiasm and direction. This was my second art history class, and it fell short in comparison to IntroArtHistory. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a bit all over the place and I felt at times like there was no real structure to the course ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of surveying the main painters of the Renaissance Age; it would be nice to be able to look at one of them more in depth however. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Suthor was always incredibly prepared for class and you would leave having learned something new. Professor Suthor teaches at a really comprehensive speed and it is really easy to follow the progression of thought. She doesn't like to lose people mid-lecture and is always really cognizant of questions and ideas that can come up. She picks the readings deliberately and ensures that they are relevant. I did not read a single thing that was off topic or strayed far from the material that we would see the next lecture. She was also really on top of creating a schedule and keeping the students in the loop. However, I do think the course would benefit from a section that met every other week. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor, professor Suthor, was incredibly supportive and knowledgable. She was incredibly responsive to any questions or concerns I had throughout the semester. I found the readings to be really interested and the chosen material covered in class was incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are very interesting subject matter and a good selection of works and readings, and also the visits to the Yale Art Gallery. The weaknesses are that sometimes the lectures were a little hard to follow/it was unclear what material was most important, so the midterm threw me off a little. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students. This class is very enjoyable and interesting. It is great to go into depth about three of the greatest artists from the renaissance the details within their greatest works. ",
            "\u00a0This class offers a great chance to learn about high Renaissance art, and I recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about these artists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting topic ",
            "\u00a0Yes, important class to take if you have little background knowledge of these artists. Very enjoyable!!! ",
            "\u00a0Getting the most out of this course requires a lot of personal enthusiasm. It's not the most engaging lecture to attend (especially compared to other art history courses), but you can learn interesting information about three great artists and their works if you commit to paying attention the whole class. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Although Professor Suthor is a brilliant art historian and one should definitely take a seminar with her at some point in their Yale career, her lectures have often been poorly structured and difficult to follow. We would jump from work to work with no explanation as to why we are making the jumps, and then would come back to works we have already discussed, but without those works appearing on the slides, so taking notes was an absolute pain. Furthermore, despite there being just 18 or so people in the class, Professor Suthor decided to cancel sections and just extend class time, so there was not much separate time for us to clarify things we didn't get in class or discuss the readings that were, in theory, supposed to provide us with the background knowledge needed for each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but make sure to stay on top of readings and the essay assignments. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A great class to take if you are unsure of whether or not art history may be your thing. Professor Suthor takes great measures to ensure that you are actually learning. She is insightful and willing to help you work through things and tries to make the seemingly \"dull\" subject of art history more interesting and attractive to a newer generation of art enthusiasts. I cannot recommend a better educator. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have a particular interest in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course enthusiastically to those interested and passionate about Renaissance art and the history of art in general. "
