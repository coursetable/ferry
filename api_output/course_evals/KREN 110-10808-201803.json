            "\u00a0I learned how to speak and write Korean at a level equivalent to L1. ",
            "\u00a0I learned elementary Korean and the basics of learning a new language. Specifically, I learned basic vocabulary, basic verbs and how to conjugate them in several tenses, and basic grammar. The difference between this introductory language class and the ones I did in high school was that I felt pushed to use what I know to make sentences. ",
            "\u00a0Basic korean languge skills ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic foundational knowledge of Korean including hangeul, present, past and future tenses, how to indicate direction/ placement, and other basic word endings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write Hangul, how to use basic conversational vocabulary/phrases/questions, how to conjugate verbs in informal and formal polite speech, what the irregular verbs are, and some small pieces about Korean culture (food, games, performing arts, politics, other traditions). ",
            "\u00a0Very basics of Korean language characters, conversation, and phrases. ",

            "\u00a0strengths - really nice way to be a beginner in a language, felt that I improved a lot, loved the interactions in groups and with partners and cultural presentations and videos, nice use of a range of learning techniques \r\nweaknesses - could have been organized more clearly for grammatical rules - for example, maybe having them all in once place, especially because grammar is not very clearly written in the textbook ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- providing easy office hours to attend\r\n- in class exercises that solidified the lessons\r\nWeakness:\r\n- sometimes unclear instruction\r\n- fast Korean dictations without any prior instruction or experience\r\n- unstructured explanation of Korean grammar rules ",
            "\u00a0Grammar points could have been more structured, could have covered more content ",
            "\u00a0Course was overall very strong. Professor Park is a wonderful teacher who was able to explain any confusions clearly. One weakness of the course was the lack of vocabulary. I feel we could have learned a lot more vocabulary but I understand the need to get the basics down first as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include pacing (very helpful for progressing vocabulary!) and cohesiveness. The conversational sections were taught in a logical order that was easy to follow. This facilitated conversational presentations that were fluid in structure and allowed us to practice several different phrases or questions within one scene. As for weaknesses, I wish the language lunch tables were more accessible time-wise. I was never able to attend and would have liked to practice with my peers outside of class more. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent blend of lecture, participation, pair-learning, interaction, conversation, etc. with a seminar-size class. The high amount of interaction between professor and student and students with each other really helped us practice and learn better. The content did seem a little rushed; vocab quizzes of 10 terms a day are fine but 45 terms in a day are kind of death. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course regards the instructor, who are very sweet and want the student to succeed. At any time are they approachable for questions, and upload their material daily for those to review. Weakness of the course however was the pacing, which can be difficult due to the amount of work needed to be put in by non-native speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: daily practice\r\nWeakness: The way the book used presents the information does not always seem logical to me. For example, I can give directions to how to reach Seoul from Busan, but I do not know how to say black. Thus, I would recommend teaching with overarching themes that facilitates memorizing new words. "

            "\u00a0The curriculum seemed to lack structure in the beginning, but eventually, you realize that it's probably the most efficient way to learn the language. It's indeed a very practical language course, and you'll come away from it knowing the basics and completely capable of furthering your Korean skills on your own, if you wish. Regarding Professor Park, she's the kindest soul you'll ever meet and truly loves her job. Her enthusiasm and kindness are unparalleled and should be protected at all costs. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, Korean is a great language to begin learning because the alphabet is arranged by syllable which makes it easy to pick up writing and then begin reading. The homework always connected directly to current class material and I had fun learning more about Korean culture alongside my peers. ",
