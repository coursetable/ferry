            "\u00a0The strength was the lecture notes, which covered thoroughly the topics seen in class.\r\n\r\nThen, it has lots of opportunities to improve. First, each session was not well designed (some of them we would spend 1 hour in a topic that could have been explained in 10 minutes). This lead to the sylabus not being followed, and we had to rush the last week to cover one more topic. Second, many of the last topics which were more complex needed some references, which were not provided (and we had, by then, little time to explore them). ",
            "\u00a0Biggest strength was the rigor I think. This class forced me to expand my economic intuition in order to keep up. I think less focus on the Slutsky equation could be helpful going forward though. It felt like we spent half the semester on the one topic, which took away from our ability to discuss game theory or other useful topics. ",

            "\u00a0The course was structured with accompanying notes, but the order in which the material was taught was confusing and the pace of the class was inconsistent. Some material seem redundant with undergraduate material. "

Otherwise, probably just take an undergrad or PhD level class. If you need or want to know about producer theory, this isn't the class for it either. ",
