            "\u00a0This course taught me really helpful skills in being critical of scientific papers, and how to navigate scientific academia despite not having a rigorous STEM background. I also learned helpful tips about presenting scientific information to general audiences and how to best explain difficult concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of interesting information about geoscience and its application in a wide range of areas: forensics, food authentication, art forgery, earthquake prediction. ",
            "\u00a0The class taught me to synthesize information for my fellow classmates, helped me learn to better present on topics, and to read, understand, and critique scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0This is an AWESOME class that honestly covers so many topics. It's really driven by the students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the scientific peer review process, as well as basic geoscience concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't know anything about geoscience until I took this course, much less how to even read science papers.\r\n\r\n1) How to critically read scientific papers\r\n\r\n2) How to write about science\r\n\r\n3) How to present the findings of scientific studies ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight on how to interact with, at first glance, daunting scientific articles. ",
            "\u00a0how to read science papers\r\ngive presentations\r\nhow to discuss the relationship between science and the legal process\r\nUnderstanding the scientific process and how to evaluate evidence, figures, and graphs\r\nmajor themes in forensic geoscience. ",
            "\u00a0I come from a strong humanities background, and initially, reading all the scientific reports and understanding them was really hard. From the class, I was able to read really interesting articles important to a given case study and see how several methods and conclusions explained in the articles were relevant  to the larger discussion of that case study. I have a lot more confidence reading these types of papers and engaging with them, especially in a way that makes them extremely relevant to questions in the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how professional scientists think. I learned how to poke holes in scientific methods and how to imagine alternative methods. I learned a great deal about geoscience, of course, especially about how to date lots of things from the past. I also became better at giving presentations. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are interesting material, great discussion, very fair assignments and grading, low stress readings, and great professor. The one single weakness is that the structure of the course was very predictable. One or two more lab visits or unique days would have been a nice break from the constant presentations. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a gem. You will not be able to find a lot of science seminar where the readings and discussions are actually very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Learning from both the professor and fellow students is a strong part of this course. You also gain the ability to present your own knowledge on your case studies and paper. You become an expert in certain scientific topics, such as isotope analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings and topics made for great discussions in the course. I do think it could be improved by being less redundant with teaching the concepts in geoscience. ",
            "\u00a0Love this course, absolutely take it if you can ge tin. Professor long is great and super open to suggestions and happy to help learn about anything. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nInteresting\r\nGreat Professor\r\nEngaging mix of learning and discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nEasy to skirt in the class without doing too much work ",
            "\u00a0I did not like that the class was mostly student-led. I would have learned more if Prof. Long actually taught the class. ",
            "\u00a0Wish that we had more opportunities to practice presentation skills.\r\nNeed more time to write the first draft of the final paper ",
            "\u00a0Professor Long is really fabulous in putting together materials that the entire class will read and be excited to learn about and talk about the next day. We always wanted more time once we got talking. The organization of the course is fabulous, and I learned a lot about a range of cases and the science relevant to them. Frankly, I think the class is already strong as it is, though it would be really awesome to get some hands-on experience with some of the techniques if the department is able (i.e.: GPR). The isotope lab was really cool, and doing more would be great. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS:\r\nWorkload is just right, especially appreciated how some readings were marked as \"optional\"\r\nDiscussions were lively and never boring.\r\nCase studies were all fun and informative.\r\nReadings were usually helpful and clear.\r\nAssignments and grading were rigorous but taught me a lot.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS:\r\nI wish there weren't so many case studies that involve the same background methods/information. It became kind of tedious to listen to 6 presentations or seismic waves and radiocarbon dating. \r\nSometimes, it felt like people were just speaking for the participation grade. I understood that there were benefits to this for class discussion, but it might be helpful to clarify how participation is graded early on so that people aren't anxiously raising their hands at every moment \r\nWish there were more time for discussions!

            "\u00a0YES. BEST SCIENCE CREDIT AT YALE. Professor Long is incredible; she is so nice, very dedicated to the course material, very invested in student learning, and very understanding of students without a strong STEM background. Grading is fair, and even though she is not a harsh grader, you will want to produce good work for her and the rest of the class because it is a small seminar. Class was interesting and engaging without the material being too difficult, and the readings were never too long or intense. Absolutely take if you need a science credit or you just want a chill 5th class. I learned a lot of useful science without ever being stressed about the work or my grade. So good! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, take it if you can get in ",
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting and thoughtful. If you have a deep fear of public speaking, know that this course requires you to give a fairly long presentation. But your classmates quickly become your friends, so this might be a great opportunity for growth! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you're looking for a fun science credit, take it! You'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to others. You definitely get an overview of geoscience concepts, and more importantly you can see how they have been applied to cases in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This feels like exactly the sort of course I'd tell a friend about to show how dynamic and exciting the coursework at Yale is. ",
            "\u00a0If a student needs a science credit, I would recommend it. I would not recommend it to a student who wants to actually go into a field like forensic geoscience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely take this course. Great science credit and a lot of connection with humanities majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the readings were typically no more than 40 pages for class, and sometimes less, meant that I could spend a lot of time doing any given reading, understand it well, and be prepared to discuss it in detail in class. The fact that the workload is more than manageable means I could get so much more out of the readings and hence the seminar itself. \r\n\r\nApart from the preparation, I had never given a 45 minute presentation or written a 15 page science based paper. Those were definitely unique to the class, and it was a great experience. Professor Long gives strong constructive feedback, which was helpful to improving the work itself. \r\n\r\nSeminar was great as well. I enjoyed hearing from classmates so much, and everyone was thrilled to talk about the case studies; people had great ideas, and the varied backgrounds from the class meant we could hear opinions based in many different disciplines, from statistics to psychology, in addition to geology. We always had such a great discussion that many of us were sorry when our time was up. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing, chill, very informative class that is as much about the practice of science (professionally), the communication of science, and the application of science to legal situations as it is about geoscience itself. You'll learn a lot of cool things about the Earth and about the many (surprising) ways investigators  have used things about the Earth to solve crimes and whatnot. Professor Maureen Long is so kind and helpful and a great discussion leader, and the people who end up getting into the class are all excited to be there. Numerical grades are a thing in this class, but the assignments come with clear rubrics and expectations. "
