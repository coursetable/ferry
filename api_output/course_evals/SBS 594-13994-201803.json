The topic has the potential to be fascinating, but it is taught in such a way that students don't learn much and they are not inspired to be more interested here. The majority of the class is focused on writing a systematic review, so if you are not deeply interested in a research career, this class does not feel very relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The course is outdated. The materials are from 10 years ago. Moreover, it talks little about medical related topics. A lot of homework but not useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent, and I really enjoyed all of the readings and discussions we had over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. It was well organized, and expectations were clearly communicated. It was great to have the experience of writing a systematic review. I feel like I gained a good understanding of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't feel like I learned a lot in this class. The readings and lectures were a bit antiquated and I would have preferred to learn more about building interventions. Midterm was graded obscenely difficult for how easy it was and really didn't test my knowledge but ability to just memorize an article. The weekly summaries were a bit unnecessary too. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of work, but the group and partner aspects of it made it more doable. The final paper was challenging but picking your own topic was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think current literature would be more beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of writing involved in this course.  A way this can be improved is rather than having weekly reading summaries due each week, having a part of the systematic due each week (or every other week) would help with the distribution of work and final product of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic class that provided me with a thorough background knowledge of our topic by covering a wide variety of research and policy. The work load was heavy, especially with the in-depth summaries due every week, but making the systematic review process progressive and broken down throughout the semester was very helpful and made us confident in our end product. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was that this course taught us how to conduct a systematic review. The weekly summaries also were helpful because we had to practice concisely summarizing research  and we got feedback. The skills developed are generalizable. Also, content was interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness was the class name. I think that if you branded it as a course in systematic reviews, using maternal and child health and nutrition as the content area, it would appeal to more students as they would better understand the utility of the course.

Most lectures are a rehashing of random work he has done or that his peers have done, so there isn't a cohesive thread in the curriculum. He also does not make himself very available. ",
