            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of medicine in America through many different perspectives. I found the topics discussed very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0That science is so much more than what we see today! Knowing its history really matters ",
            "\u00a0I learned how intertwined American history is with \"medicine\" over the past four centuries. The class makes you question how current day public health, healthcare, and medicine came to be and the impact of different economic, political, and social factors in a seemly independent field. ",
            "\u00a0Being that this seminar was my first history course at Yale, it taught me how to ready historical papers and understand the events in a greater historical context. I learned about America's history of medicine and the impact it had not only in science, but also in society as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of medicine in the U.S. and society's perceptions of diseases in different decades. ",

            "\u00a0I didn't know much about medical history, especially pre-1900's so I learned a ton about that.  I also learned how to structure a research paper/history paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the evolution and history of medicine in America and how its progression impacted society and reflected contemporary society. I also learned how to use primary and secondary sources to develop a thesis argument and research paper. I read primary and secondary sources  and learned to use them piece together a larger picture of the historical period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the social, political, and cultural impacts of medicine throughout history. You begin the class with 17th century midwives and end the class with the AIDS epidemic. I feel like I understand the relevance of doctors more from just a scientific viewpoint. "

            "\u00a0Strengths- very interesting \r\nweakness- does not help you improve your writing skills and doesn't teach you how to write. they just expect you to know how. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The workload was usually manageable--3 papers throughout the semester spaced out pretty evenly. The readings and discussions flowed very well together. \r\nWeakness: Not really any, except that sometimes the discussions were dry if many people didn't do the readings for one night. ",
            "\u00a0Too many reading responses. Loved the discussions though! ",
            "\u00a0The class is extremely reading heavy. I especially liked the material we covered and the ability to pass on up to three discussion posts. ",
            "\u00a0The course has really interesting reading assignments that cover many of the important topics and events throughout medical history from the colonial period in the United States. I enjoyed the textbook \"Major Problems in the History of American Medicine and Public Health\" as well as the novels and historical books that were assigned. Although the readings were fairly detailed in the historical context, I felt that there was somewhat of a lack of \"tying things together\" to better analyze themes and motifs throughout history. I hoped that in class discussion these overarching themes could be better drawn, but in the end, I did not feel confident in my ability to recognize these recurrent themes. This course could be improved by allotting more time into explicitly defining these themes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include class discussions, field trips, and the books chosen to learn from. The weaknesses include a comprehensive rubric on how essays are being graded and getting feedback on drafts before turning in the final essay. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the discussion format. I really enjoyed being able to talk about some interesting topics with several other first-years. The textbook for this course was also well-selected to closely match what we were learning about. \r\n\r\nI think a weakness of this course was that it was listed as a writing credit. By and large, this class focused on history, not writing. By this I mean that while this class definitely made me a better historian, it really didn't help me improve my writing skills as a writer. We spent maybe one half of one class talking about what constitutes good writing. Also, much of the feedback on the papers was short and focused on the historical aspects rather than writing aspects. Yet again, this was not inherently bad and helped me grow as a historian, but had little impact on bettering my writing.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be slightly changing the grading scale. I definitely put in more work cumulatively doing the readings and reading responses than on either of the small papers, yet they were worth nearly equal portions of my grade. I would maybe change the grading scale so that participation and reading are worth more of the grade than they are now. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes when books did not divide evenly into halves, we had too much reading with not enough time to do it.  In particular we would often have two days to read half of a 200 page book and later we would have two days to read half of a 400 page book.  It seems disproportionate. ",
            "\u00a0It's just an overall great course. The readings are interesting. Seminar classes are always engaging, welcoming, frank, and have quality discussions. I really did learn a lot about analyzing different primary and secondary sources to build a strong argument. The field trips made the class material real and come off the pages, which was amazing. I felt like a real historian. I can't really think of any complaints. ",
            "\u00a0I think there was too much reading to actually deeply understand. Everyone just skimmed it by the end, and it hurt me to do this because I wanted more time! There is many strengths. Professor Tannenbaum is amazing and cares about the subject and the students. She creates an exciting discussion each class, and there are a few fun field trips. However, do not take this class if you are looking to improve as a writer. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I came in as wanting to major in psychology and this course inspired me to be an HSHM major. it's very interesting and professor Tannenbaum is awesome! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this class was a good introduction to HSHM courses and the readings for every class were quite manageable, unlike some other first-year seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It's a lot of work. But it's good to know as an intellectual. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is a lot of fun and helpful in teaching you beyond the course material--such as learning how to use all of Yale resources. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I feel as though I learned a lot about the history of medicine in America, but I would warn the student that sometimes the class discussion does not go further than what was covered in the readings (meaning there isn't a deeper discussion of the themes and repercussions of certain events, nor a more detailed setting of the events in a greater historical context than what is already said in the reading). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is truly passionate about the history of medicine, rather than a student who is taking this class for a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Great course if your interested in the impact of medicine on society. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if you are really interested in the history of medicine and how society influences medicine. However, to the average student of this class which for us was a pre-med looking for a writing credit, at times the material can get fairly dull. I would not recommend this class if you need a writing credit and want to significantly improve your writing skills. Basically, you leave this course as just about the same writer as you came into it as. The grading is not ideal either. The grade depends significantly on the papers you write which honestly I found took a lot less time than the large amounts of reading each week. It is somewhat difficult to know what is expected in each paper, and many of the science-minded students in our class found this rather frustrating.  The discussions are pretty interesting, but there is no real disagreement on the major topics so discussions often divulge to just series of agreeing and repeating the same thing but in slightly different words. Make sure you really enjoy history before taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you're only taking it to get a writing credit and are not interested in the material you probably can find an easier writing credit.  The papers are also very research-oriented so if you are interested in more creative assignments you may not like it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely--the material is fascinating, the reading is interesting, the seminar environment is welcoming, and the discussion is engaging. I would have gotten a lot out of the course by simply attending class, but the readings, papers, and field trips made me really engage with course and get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are premed because it gives you a deeper understanding about the impact of doctors. "
