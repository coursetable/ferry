",
            "\u00a0The course is decent as a whole. It is challenging, but it presents a wide array of material in a short period of time. One thing that could be improved is the exams. 50 minutes in-class is simply not enough time to complete the exams. Students have little time to think, which makes the test averages extremely low (and then they are curved artificially high). The PowerPoint slides are also dull and hard to understand. The TFs don't seem very engaged with the course or very knowledgeable about certain topics. These changes would make the course better organized and more engaging for students as they grapple with the difficult material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very good at getting you to learn material; I understand everything thoroughly, which was the goal of the course. Another strength is the lectures, which never fail to be interesting. That being said, the problem sets in this course were quite long, at times excessively so. Perhaps one area of improvement would be shortening them. Other than that, however, almost everything in the course was a strength, including the professor and the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course is well organized with the different units, TAs were very helpful with the extra practice problems, Professor Wang is a great instructor, peer tutors were fabulous. Weaknesses: the in-class exams were stressful because of the limited time, so maybe there could be less content on the midterms so students aren't so rushed. I also would have appreciated more practice material in preparation for the exams, maybe even a practice final. ",
            "\u00a0This course is supposed to be for students who have a strong chemistry background, so I was expecting this course to go into more depth about some topics that most of the students probably felt pretty comfortable about. The equilibrium, solubility, and acids and bases, for example, seemed like a repeat from AP chemistry and I don't feel like I learned anything more about these topics than I knew coming in. It would have been nice if these topics were either covered in a more advanced way to give us a deeper understanding, or if they were given less lecture time that could have been instead devoted to nuclear chemistry or spectrophotometry, two topics which were new to me and I would have appreciated having more time to develop a deeper understanding of these topics instead of having them squeezed into the last few weeks of the class. I think it would have been better to teach these difficult topics earlier in the semester to allow students to have more time to engage with and understand nuclear chemistry and spectrophotometry - for the last few weeks of class where students don't have the chance to practice the topics on psets/midterms, it would be better to teach topics that are simpler/topics like acids/bases that most of the students already have a general understanding of. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the tests were very long and did not necessarily test knowledge but how fast you could do the math. I felt like my accuracy on point I answered were very high as the math and concepts tended to be easy but I struggled to finish the test with the time allowed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very organized, psets were challenging but doable ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught phenomenally well. It is excellent in all respects and should not be altered in any way. By far my favorite course at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the TAs, Professor, and homework. I think the one thing this course lacked was practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely organized, which helped me to follow along lectures and structure my learning process. The problem sets and Sapling helped learning a lot and always followed lectures, so I always learned a lot. The challenge of this course was extremely great, which allowed me to grow as a person, student, and scientist. The peer tutors were so helpful, and I would not have been able to get through the course without them. Some weaknesses include a lack of new problems to go through and practice before exams. Another one sometimes are some TAs. They sometimes do not answer my questions in a way that makes sense, and the peer tutors are able to. They also sometimes leave office hours when they are not supposed to. Discussion sections got more useful as the semester went on, but they could be used to do more problems. Still, TAs were pretty invaluable, but they could make some adjustments. ",
            "\u00a0The course is difficult, and I feel as if the information in lecture is too pared down. The problems sets seemed to be somewhat difficult for the material given in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the peer tutors were very good and helped me tremendously. I wish that more practice problems were given. Many of my other courses would post tests from previous years, but we didn't really get any other practice problems that matched the difficultly level of the exams (other than the problem sets, but I had already spent some much time working on those that I basically had them memorized). ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets/saplings were sometimes not on pace with the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor is often available, peer tutors and TA hours were often\r\nWeaknesses: Tests were very difficult, Lectures were rather dry (although this, I think, doesn't really have a solution), TA sections were not very helpful for my particular TA (other TAs were helpful) so section attendance was questionable ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good lectures, professor was always available to answer questions.\r\nWeaknesses: section was a waste of time and I didnt learn much from it, homework was difficult and I needed to go to extra help to finish it, there was a large gap between in class knowledge and tested knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teacher actually teaches stuff, and it is pretty straightforward what is going to be on tests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could have been more engaging. Also, the TAs should have incentivized coming to section more. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very difficult for me and a lot of students. This was mainly because of the exams. Other than the final, we never had enough time to take the exams; our midterms were always in-class on Friday and almost no one had time to do all the problems, it was really a mad-dash to get as much down on the paper, even something that might be wrong so you could get partial credit for it. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is clearly extremely knowledgeable and lectures are clear. The course material is an excellent extension of what people learned in high school, which makes it even more interesting. The exams are not written for the allotted time, which makes them extremely stressful and anxiety-inducing. Also, the exam content was at times not a clear extension of what was learned in class/psets. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Wang is a dedicated teacher but unfortunately not very engaging and oftentimes difficult to understand. That being said, the lecture slides are very clear and the course is well structured, so it is easy to follow along. I appreciated the fact that he included many lectures beyond the standard gen-chem curriculum such as in spectroscopy, nuclear chemistry, and batteries. These lectures, however, felt a bit rushed because he tried to pack a ton of material into just a few lectures. We weren't expected to understand much from these lectures for the final, but I almost would have appreciated it if he had included less material in these lectures but expected us to understand this material in greater depth for the final. I feel like a lot of students dismissed this extra content as just \"extra stuff we do not need to know\". Since this course is supposed to be at a higher level than regular gen chem, I feel like more emphasis on extra material like this would have been beneficial. I was honestly a little bored when we went through the acid/base, kinetics, and solubility units, as this stuff was emphasized a lot in AP chem. \r\nOne area in which this course could definitely improve in is the way homework is assigned. I liked the written homework assignments a lot, as the questions were quite thought-provoking. However, we were also assigned a ton of online homework via sapling (sometimes 40 questions), and oftentimes these questions were super tedious, boring, and time consuming. I wish we would have been assigned less of these sapling questions and more written homework questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Wang was very detailed and slow in his lectures\r\n\r\nWeakness: Midterms were a time crunch ",
            "\u00a0I think my strengths were learning about all aspects of chemistry. However, my weakness was that I had some trouble with finding the answers to qualitative problems. However, I felt that I mastered the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Course was strong overall. Problem sets matched the level of difficulty of the exams pretty well and it was overall pretty organized. ",
            "\u00a0The class was structured well, but the pacing could have been a little slower. There were some things that were presented too quickly, and key concepts in the class, such as the different types of spectroscopy, that could have been taught with more explanation. ",
            "\u00a0I think the scope of the course was appropriate, but the lectures were somewhat lacking in comparison to the problem sets and what we were supposed to be able to do. Although I went to virtually every lecture, I found myself unable to finish a problem set successfully without going to office hours every week. I think this is because the lectures were purely conceptual while the psets were highly quantitative. I think that the course could do a better job of correlating the lectures and the psets more so that there is more balance. ",
            "\u00a0It certainly provides students with a depth of understanding in chemistry far beyond a traditional Gen Chem course. If you're interested long term in Chemistry or the physical sciences pertaining to chemistry, definitely take this course. Organic is too hard and base gen chem is just AP chem, waste of time. The weakness in this course was that a lot of the content was very complex and nuanced, but was not communicated that way in lecture. Topics that were incredibly difficult to understand weren't breezed through without thorough explanation. The exams also tested us on material that was never addressed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The depth of material covered in the lectures vs. the psets/exams was different. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs could have done a much better job reviewing the material covered each week as most of it was too complex to gain a full understanding of from a single lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the professor was really open to questions and anybody could go to him for help, which was a strength of the course. But, I really feel that most people felt most comfortable going to the peer tutors, and I think the review sessions they held were one of the most vital things for a lot of students' studying.\r\nEven though the TAs vary every year, I feel like I should also point out how helpful the TAs were to the learning of the material.\r\n\r\nI wish we didn't spend our TA discussion sections going over homework problems, and maybe had some additional practice problems, because by the end, a lot of people weren't really engaged or motivated to go to their discussion section.\r\nAlso, it really depended on the TA, so a lot of people ended up skipping their TA section and going to another one's who they thought taught better. ",
            "\u00a0the lectures were a good pace but they were not always very clear. sometimes it was hard to understand what the teacher said and also the lack of example problems made it hard to know when/how to apply certain concepts. more examples and better explanations, not just long math derivations of formulas, would be very helpful. also some of math required on exams was beyond what i ever learned which seems unfair for a class that claims to require no calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: Insanely difficult tests where the class average could be anywhere from the 60s to 80s. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest issue with this course was the exams. All three midterms did not test your knowledge of the material, but instead your ability to do problems as quickly as possible. Each of the midterms was a 1 - 1:15 exam that we were given 50 minutes for, and as far as I know basically no one finished a single midterm fully. Fixing this, and testing mastery of the material rather than speed would go a long way towards improving this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of information, which was pretty well taught. \r\n\r\nI really struggled with the structure of the tests in this class. The midterms featured questions that were about as intense as those on problem sets, but were crammed into a fifty-minute class period. The tests felt like a race for how fast you could plug in numbers and churn out the right equations, with it being common for students to only get through slightly over half of the questions. As someone whose learning style revolves around critical thinking and purposeful processing of information, I need time to think through each question rather than robotically plugging numbers into equations. I would encourage Prof. Wang to think about what he is trying to assess with these tests (particularly the midterms). If the goal of the exams is to reward students who can solve problems fastest, then the exams are accomplishing that. But if the exams are intended to measure and reflect a student's thinking and understanding of chemistry, Prof Wang should recognize that different students process information at different speeds, and that speed in testing is not a complete indicator of understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Since the course material was at a high level, I wish we had more chances in class to tackle problems and actually practice the difficult concepts learned. This would have ensured that we actually understood the material before building onto an even more complex concept. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This was my favorite class this year because of the challenge of the problems and the creativity of Professor Wang. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was very interesting, the professor is great, and it provides an intellectual challenge. Exams are difficult and there is quite a bit of homework, but it is a fair class with a lot of support. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is pre-med or a chemistry major, or to a student who is really interested in delving deep into difficult topics of chemistry, especially the more quantitative (rather than conceptual) side of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. If you are looking for a course that will teach you chemistry in a way that you will remember, then definitely take this course. I learned far more about chemistry than I expected, and all of it actually makes sense to me. Despite the somewhat higher workload, there are definite advantages to taking this course instead of lower chemistry numbered courses if you actually care about learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you really love chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this class. It's quite challenging but I learned so much and I'm glad I took this over the gen chem class. It goes into topics way beyond AP chem, and there is a lot of help available (including TAs and peer tutors). ",
            "\u00a0For students who have a strong background in chemistry and are looking to really be challenged and learn new material, I would recommend trying to place into first-year orgo instead of taking this class. If students have a strong background in chemistry but are not that passionate about it/excited to learn new material, I would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but one has to be ready for you grade to be assessed on speed rather than pure knowledge. ",

The psets were super tough, but I learned how to critically thing. Professor Wang is extremely sweet, and his lectures and demonstrations are interesting. The only thing to be aware of are the exams, which are extremely difficult. They won't necessarily reflect how much you study for them. Still, you will gain a broader view of chemistry. You will understand the root reasons for certain theories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are seriously considering studying chemistry and have taken 163 in the fall. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they already have a good understanding of concepts in general chemistry and are at least comfortable with integral calculus. Dr. Wang uses in-depth mathematical explanations to dig into concepts that students are/should be aware of. ",
            "\u00a0It's probably one of the hardest classes that I've taken at Yale, and I had to put a ton of effort into it. So, I would only take it if you're really interested in chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Taking 163/167 instead of normal gen chem lecture is fun because different topics and smaller lecture. You'll feel like you don't get stuff (and you probably don't) but the curve is pretty generous. I'd recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a choice between 165 and 167, I'd say take 165 unless you really want to devote a lot of time towards chemistry and are genuinely interested in it. That being said, I didn't have a choice and I think the class was still manageable. However, there are times when I wish I had decided to skip gen chem and take orgo instead (for a myriad of reasons -- orgo is more interesting, gen chem lab is not great, less requirements, etc). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is very comprehensive and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to someone who needs to take it, whether it be for their major or pre-med requirements. Most people would not enjoy the rigor and struggle that this course is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially because 163 is a really wonderful learning opportunity and 167 is the next logical step. Youll start to understand the things you learned in high school on a much deeper level. However, it is not as gratifying as 163. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly really wish I had taken organic chemistry. 163/167 were good and engaging courses, but I felt like 167 was too similar to AP chem to have been worth my time. Had I taken orgo, I would have had much greater flexibility in my future course selection and would not have repeated stuff I already knew. 167, did on the other hand, provide me with a strong foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you took AP chemistry, then definitely take this over General chemistry. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class with Prof. Wang if you want a class that will challenge you. He stutters a little, but he is an actual chemistry genius and really knows what he is teaching. The class is fast-paced. It's hard to keep up sometimes. But if you have even the slightest interest in chemistry, you will learn so much about the fundamentals of all of the concepts that you explored in AP Chemistry. At first, I wanted to take CHEM165 because it was the easier class -- I'm so glad that I took CHEM167. Prof. Wang blew my mind most days and taught me to grasp an even greater understanding of chemistry concepts. This class is difficult, but so rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0If chemistry is your strong suit and you are really interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the material, definitely take this course. The math can seem intimidating but it is certainly doable, and as long as you put the work in to do the psets and study for exams your grade will be fine--Prof. Wang is really generous with the grading curve because I really do think he prioritizes learning and doesn't want students to be stressed about their grade. Compared to my many friends in CHEM 165, I was definitely more challenged and had more work, but I also think I enjoyed the class and felt satisfied by it significantly more than my 165 friends did. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you're interested in chemistry long term. For students who have just taken AP Chem in HS, the course material is both challenging yet manageable. Organic Chem is rough for most first years and regular gen chem is just AP Chem. This intermediate sequence strikes a solid balance between the two. The class itself is not super engaging. Hailiang is an awesome guy, very approachable and an actual genius, but the class itself is not particularly enjoyable. He covers a lot of complex material very quickly and mumbles through most of it anyway - like literally mumbles. Keep in mind though that the difficulty of the course is taken into account when curving the final class grades. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a good introduction to pchem. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you really like chemistry and are prepared to study and review the material a lot more than you would for another course because it takes much more time to understand than most courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, because the professor was extremely kind and generous (wow that curve). At first, I was unsure because I thought that it was going to be really hard but then I looked at the exam distribution for the first test and I realized everybody was in the same boat. So, it turned out to be a really nice experience because then everybody was just focused on learning and not on their grade so much. ",
            "\u00a0no, unless they are a chem genius. this course was so hard and disappointing for me because no matter how long I studied or how hard i tried, i never got the results i wanted on the exams. exams were long and had little time to complete, and there felt like little reward for all the effort. it was also not a very interesting class in my opinion ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it's a fun course. I enjoy chemistry so I would recommend the advanced class for those who really like it. However, it's incredibly difficult to do well on tests, so be mindful of that. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. You won't really learn anything new if you've taken AP Chemistry, and the work (especially the online Sapling homework) can be unnecessarily repetitive and tedious. Additionally, the stress due to the time ridiculous time constraints on the exams is not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have a strong desire and the time to tackle complex, quantitative chemistry problems. "
