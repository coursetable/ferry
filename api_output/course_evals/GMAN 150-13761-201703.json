            "\u00a0I would say a strength of this class is the small size and that there were no native speakers, as can sometimes happen in L5 courses. I think that the class could have been structured better so as to develop vocabulary and grammar, as all of the students struggled with this. The syllabus seems to have been designed to facilitate a lot of conversation, but that can become very slow when the students in the class cannot communicate with any semblance of ease. Adding in an emphasis on vocabulary and grammar would make this class seem more worthwhile. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have completed L1-L4 (or the equivalent) at Yale, but not to native/fluent speakers. Also, if you are more comfortable talking or livening up a class atmosphere, you will probably get more out of this class than students who are quieter. ",
