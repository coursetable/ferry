            "\u00a0Learning from practitioners makes a huge difference. Bill and Amy have experienced a different kind of life from most profs at FES, and their insights and passion are invaluable ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing to learn from practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some practical lessons from conservationists who have worked around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I gained some insight into the NGO world, and now I understand a bit more about how NGOs are structured. ",
            "\u00a0This course got me to think more critically about conservation, and my role in approaching these issues. It has helped to shift my ethic, and open my eyes to many more of the complexities associated with conservation problems. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first conservation class, so everything was new to me and very useful to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Amy and Bill are widely regarded as leaders in the field of conservation. This is one reason that I took the course. Also because of this, I believe that this course offered me insight into the predominant philosophies and approaches to applied conservationin particular, conservation of wildlife and biodiversity, which, based on this course, seems to be the primary focus of conservation efforts globally. Through this course, I also learned about the bureaucratic structures of conservation organizations, grant-providing agencies, and other large national and international actors. It is clear that the field is struggling. There are insufficient funds and time to complete projects, and conservation projects continue to foreground Western-scientific priorities of wildlife and biodiversity to the detriment of other stakeholders and socio-environmental concerns. \r\nHowever, several of the guest speakers in the class presented other views and approaches to conservation, so it is clear that Amy and Bills approach is not representative of the entire field. It was certainly interesting to gain insight into projects like mapping of indigenous territories, creating community-managed forest concessions, and applying TEK to conservation policies. I came away from the class with the impression that the field of conservation is internally conflicted, trying to figure out how to stay relevant, and, yet, conservationists and conservation NGOs must remain a central player in addressing environmental issues going forward. ",
            "\u00a0How to reframe and manage conservation issues more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a clearer understanding of the complexities that are involved with conservation, such as community, scale and stakeholders. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a critical reasoning for all that is involved in conservation work: from the foundation pillars of NGO's all the way up to the measurement of effectiveness of conservation and development plans. I gained deep insights on the role of community-based conservation from reviewing different conservation projects around the world. Also, the fact of having exposure to so many good speakers throughout the semester on the \"talks on the wild side\" made me even more conscious on the careful interaction between science, communities and the role of government in ensuring the protection of biodiversity in the world.

            "\u00a0It aligned well. I wanted expose to more mainstream, currently-in-practice conservation skills and perspectives. This offered that. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well. ",
            "\u00a0This class fell below my expectations. Other than from the guest speakers, I didn't learn as much as I hoped. ",
            "\u00a0Well my expectations for this course were pretty high, because I had learned so much about Dr. Vedder and Dr. Weber from other students. I wasn't disappointed in the class, I still really enjoyed it, but I didn't feel as engaged as I could have been. But that could have also been due to the class size (it was a little larger than Dr. Vedder and Dr. Weber would have liked). A lot of the other students also had previous experiences in an NGO. And since I didn't, I felt like it was harder for me to contribute to the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned well with my expectations. I took the course because I had not taken any non-technical courses at FES, so this course helped me to think about issues more broadly, than others I have taken at FES. ",
            "\u00a0fairly in line with expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I expected the class to have more of a biology aspect to it, rather than being so heavy on social science. ",

            "\u00a0I think that I expected to learn more throughout the course. I felt like many of our classes ended up feeling repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Although outlined in the syllabus, I really found unexpected to step back and asking ourselves the reason of conservation why and to whom? The topics covered were very powerful, although at some point I felt that we were rushing through some of them only for the sake of following the syllabus. "

            "\u00a0Bill and Amy are away of this, but a smaller class would likely be better. I do think the readings would benefit from more contrast within each week. For instance, it would be great to have one article about scale from a practitioner's view, and then another from the more academic literature that offers a strong critique of this notion. I suppose the balance of theory and practice could be reworked. Also, I think that discussions would benefit from assigning some students each week to lead and create questions. Rather than just beginning class with very open, \"what do you think\" sorts of questions, it would be great to have 3 students who have prepared comments to engage the class, with input from Bill and Amy during class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n Possibility of talking one-to-one with the invited speakers.\r\n Learn from people who have tons of experience in the field.\r\n Acknowledge the general challenges in conservation.\r\n\r\nTo improve:\r\n Sometimes it was too focused in Rwanda.\r\n Discussion is great but lectures could be more extensive. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were our guest speakers, and time discussing the moral issues of conservation in small groups. One weakness of the course were the readings, which I found to be of pretty low quality. Another weakness of the course was lecture, which I found to be repetitive and not engaging. In particular, lectures attempted to cover so many case studies in a short amount of time, without adequate supporting details. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be more helpful if there was less discussion and more lecturing. I felt that the topics for each class were redundant. ",
            "\u00a0I wish all of the readings for both Tuesday's and Thursday's class could have been uploaded during the weekend beforehand. I try to get all of the readings out of the way earlier, so it would have been helpful to have had more time to get it done.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did like about the class was the public speakers that they brought in. They came from a variety of different backgrounds, and I appreciated the opportunity to join them for dinner or to talk privately with them the following day. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate the diversity of thought and opinions that are expressed through this course. The insights from Amy and Bill based on their many years working as practitioners in the field was valuable and informative. I think they knew it might be a problem going into it, but the size of the class I think made it a bit more difficult to have deep conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated class discussion, but prefer it to be more directed by the profs. Thinking through issues is nice, but hearing from other students is less useful. ",
            "\u00a0The one good thing about this course is the guest speakers. Aerin Jacobs was exceptionalhands down the best speaker and doing truly incredible work bridging social and natural science; indigenous and western knowledge. All of the speakers were good and brought in their own perspectives on doing conversation worksomething I wanted to learn from Amy and Bill, but did not. The opportunity to have dinner with speakers was absolutely a highlight. I not only got to know these fascinating individuals better, but I also got to know my classmates and Amy and Bill. The most interesting discussions from this course happened over these dinnersnot in the classroom. \r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAmy and Bills pedagogical approach is the overarching weakness to this course. \r\n\r\nAs I detailed above, their lectures are repetitive and lack sufficient detail for students to really engage with the case studies presented. Class and small group discussions are micro-managed. Amy and Bill frequently countered critiques, questions and ideas raised by students by asking individual students or the class at large to offer a solution to the critique raised. This approach frequently has the effect of shutting down discussion. I do not think that insisting students posit solutions if raising critiques is appropriate. Certainly, in a real-world scenario working for an NGO or negotiating with a government, it may not be useful to raise semantic questions or critique the premise of a project. However, this seminar class is precisely not a real-world scenario! Rather, a seminar class is an opportunity to explore, critique, and understand a whole range of ideas related to conservation. This includes interrogating the definitions and assumptions that undergird the conservation field so that, when working in conservation in the future, students can more effectively actually push the field forward to make it more effective. \r\n\r\nAmy and Bill opened the semester by claiming to establish a consensus for the class that the goal of conservation is protecting biodiversity. They were not open to real debate or discussion on this point. Perhaps this should have been a cue for me to drop the course, but I still hoped it would get better. I really do want to learn more about the practice of conservation and how and why it can be relevant and successful, though I did not gain many insights from this class (except through some of the guest speakers!). Many of my written and discussion responses focused on critiques of and challenges to that assumption about conservation. I believe that my critical approach left Amy and Bill (as well as perhaps some of my classmates) with the impression that I think the field of conservation is entirely problematic or that I cannot understand other lines of critique. My concerns about conservation that prioritizes biodiversity and wildlife stem from reading articles and taking courses that critique this kind of conservation throughout both my undergrad and masters. There is extensive evidence that conservation projects can be damaging to human communities and even to ecosystems they attempt to protect. I would have loved for Amy and Bill to actually engage with the points I raised and provide their practitioners perspectives on my critiques. They have tremendous knowledge about the field that I do not have! But I have read about a lot of problems with the field of conservation and so I raised those critiques. It would have been interesting to learn from Amy and Bill why they disagree or just how they approach problems. Rather than engaging with me, they were dismissive or simply changed the subject. I really enjoyed hearing about and discussing some of these issues with guest speakers like Aerin Jacobs and Jeremy Radachowsky, however. ",
            "\u00a0It was hard for shy students to get into the discussions because the class was large and some students were very vocal.  I felt like the readings were often not relevant to the discussions and I would have liked to see more of the reflections brought into class. ",
            "\u00a0Amy and Bill are both practitioners with a lot of experience; I think it would have been more interesting to hear a bit more of their own lessons learnt. \r\n\r\nSometimes the discussions felt very sporadic and fleeting so that it was hard to draw macro connections between the various issues discussed in any given class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -  very engaged professors, interesting topic, great facilitation of discussion, loved the guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses - often felt repetitive, sometimes boring, readings were not particularly interesting or useful\r\nHow could it be improved - I think allowing us to do a deeper dive into one or two case studies would have been useful. Also, learning more from the personal experiences of Amy and Bill would have been very beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to have only a couple of questions that can ignite the conversation and that can be useful for more than only one session. That was certainly valid at the beginning of the semester, but then we quickly jumped from one topic to the other without quite having a handle on the basic concepts or ideas. The discussions were rich and powerful -the ones on canvas and those in the classroom- however, I would suggest having a more \"guided discussion\" with less questions -maybe less students- so that, in a way the topic can be fully covered, understood and savored by everyone.

            "\u00a0Take it. Bill and Amy offer valuable insights beyond the course content. They offer an opportunity for various kinds of growth ",
            "\u00a0Do the readings and take advantages of the opportunities presented in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you already know you want to be a conservation practitioner and are looking to network with great leaders in the field. But if you are looking for more nuanced, rigorous discussion of conservation issues this class may be disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great for someone who has experience working in conservation internationally. It builds on many of the concepts and ideas that I have learned over the years working or visiting conservation projects throughout the tropics. ",
            "\u00a0Think of questions to bring to discussion beforehand. Speak early and often - Amy and Bill have a lot to teach and unpack in their breadth of experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly advise against taking this course. \r\n\r\nHowever, if a student is really interested in the class (or interested in Amy and Bill), I would also suggest shopping the course and talking to Amy and Bill early in the semester to assess the ways in which the course may be different than it was this year. Amy and Bill have said that they take course evaluations into account and it sounds like they revise the course often. Alternatively, an interested student could just attend the lectures and go to Amy and Bills office hours and probably get the same benefits without having to actually sit through the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're into social science and policy, go for it. ",
            "\u00a0Listening to Amy and Bill's life-experiences is so enriching and fulfilling that immediately awakens one's desire to understand and involve in conservation. The workload is moderate, and their support in writing the final paper is awesome, given that their expertise can only be comparable to very few other people; both mix academic and real-life problem solving into perfection\r\nThe topics covered are really engaging and discussions during class are very fruitful, thanks to careful selection of students they make, and which most of them have had experience related to the field in many parts of the world.
