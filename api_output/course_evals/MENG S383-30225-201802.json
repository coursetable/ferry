            "\u00a0This course teaches mechanics in 3D and this is how you learn how to deal with complexities of 3D motion and be able to solve problems. Dynamics helps you explore the causes of motion and analyze forces acting on different bodies and the properties of the bodies, particularly moment of inertia. The class prepares you for Celestial mechanics and other classical mechanics branches. You would also learn how to write/modify code in MATLAB which is a good preparation for learning Statistical mechanics and helps you explore different research endeavors in Mechanical Engineering. ",

            "\u00a0Good but disorganized. Hard to study, some homeworks were Matlab based, but tests were not ",
            "\u00a0The pace of summer classes can be jarring and in general, it was hard to see the broader picture of dynamics while trying to keep up with the problems in the immediate. The strengths were definitely the amount of interaction between all the students, Corey, and Aya. "
