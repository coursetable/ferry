            "\u00a0I had no foundation in this subject matter before taking the course and now feel I have a really, really good knowledge base in the topic. I also saw how it can relate to other topics in environmental studies and how the tools used in MFA-SEM could be used in conjunction with the tools of other disciplines. ",

Possible this is because the group included undergraduates to phd students and everyone in between. I think that it might have been more successful as a research seminar to more advanced students with slightly more advanced material. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly what I had hoped to get out of a seminar-style course. Would be neat to do a small project associated with a natural resource of personal interest, and doing some data digging to see what is out there and how they might be utilized in an MFA study. ",
            "\u00a0Very nice mix of readings, homework assignments of different types, seminar format discussion and final paper. 3rd credit work project oriented which is also different and complementary to the 2 credit materials. Truly run as a seminar format but with good leadership from the main instructor (Tomer Fishman) to frame the topics and encourage discussion. ",

            "\u00a0Invest time in the readings and look for opportunities to really understand the tools and techniques of MFA-SEM and how they can be used. Understand the technical aspects but then be created with how those can be applied. I also took the Waste Management course and thought that this semester the two courses were very complementary and I was glad I took them during the same semester. "
