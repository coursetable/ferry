            "\u00a0Not very organized. The pacing could be better. Nice to be in Italy. The classes had a lot of discrepancies between grading. Teaching could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course itself was very fun and I'm so happy that I chose to study abroad. I did not, however, love staying with a host family. I understand that the point of this program was to submerge students in the Italian culture, however, I feel it could be improved by offering students the option to stay in a dorm or apartment or somewhere not with a host family. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's interactive and students need to stay on their toes\r\nWeaknesses: Sink or swim system - students given little to no support or leeway ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it is a small class so the teachers can pay attention to the students and correct mistakes and everyone has a chance to participate in class. The teachers were very helpful and always open to answer questions and help with host families. A weakness of the course is that a lot of fo students would speak English in the class and would not try to participate in the immersive nature of the summer abroad course. This could have been improved by being more strict with the students who would talk during class and require students to speak only Italian. Another weakness is that there were two sections of the same course but they were taught very differently and the assignments were often very unfair and the other section had a lot less work assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very strong. I think the order of some of the grammar concepts could be improved, but that is not necessarily an issue with the course and more of an issue with the textbook. That being said, I do not know of a better textbook to recommend. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The whole study abroad program was so incredible and I learned so much, both in school and just from being in a foreign country. I loved this trip. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're ready to do it on your own and accept the autonomy of learning and overcoming independently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. Italian is a fun language to learn and it was great to be in Italy! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I think it covers really key concepts and tenses that one must learn to truly be able to speak the language. With just L1, your vocabulary is very limited. However, after taking L2, you can actually say most things that you want to express. Obviously, you might not be fluent, but you can definitely get by. ",
            "\u00a0You get what you sign up for. It's an intense course, make no mistake, and the teaching is too fast for any real substantive learning in class. We'd just read over a chapter in the text book call-and-response style, and then it's all the way up to you to motivate yourself and learn the content alone. "
