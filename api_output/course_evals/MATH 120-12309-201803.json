            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of multivariable calculus. This included intuitive skills that helped to determine how to approach and solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about calculus in multiple variables, including derivatives and integrals as well as vector calculus and different coordinate systems. I learned how to problem solve and take problems step by step. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various mathematical concepts and picked up quite a few skills. Plenty of it was quite interesting. It was the first multi-variable calculus class I'd taken so I had an introduction to the next level of mathematics. Built on my previous knowledge greatly. ",

            "\u00a0This class is just one whole weakness. From the fact that there is ONE single good instructor to how poorly written the tests were. ",
            "\u00a0It should have been more focused toward teaching toward the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0Some sections are weaker than others. I had a friend in another section that was getting more structured teaching that would've been beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how much resources there were in this course, especially the practice problems available and Ximera. The course builds on itself with the material gradually, and it gets more difficult especially after the first midterm. I think the only thing that I wish was improved was if there were solutions to all the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Felt that course material was not tied towards any sort of real world application. What is curl? What are the physical implications of a conservative function? I know it's a pure math class but I would have enjoyed a bit more engagement with real-world applications. However, I do feel that I picked up skills and how to use the ideas and concepts to solve pure math problems. ",
            "\u00a0Anibal was a good teacher but taught as if this was a proof-based class or perhaps similar to what he taught at Princeton. The course as a whole is terrible. It moves at an extremely fast pace and the \"curve\" is messed up by the students who have already taken multivariable (there are quite a few). Many students fall behind and do poorly. ",
            "\u00a0This course doesnt focus on applications. You learn how to do things but dont know what any of them mean. Feels pointless. ",
            "\u00a0It requires a lot of extra practice. It would be better if we can cover more problem solving techniques in class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I learned about calculus in a great depth, and this class did a good job in exposing me to the various aspects of calculus. It was challenging and sometimes I would be really confused as to what I am doing although it was a computational course, but I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, the math is important for doing anything higher level. The course was fine, didn't blow my mind but I'm happy I took it and moved to the next level of mathematics. ",
