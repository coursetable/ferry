            "\u00a0Learned to write effective non-fiction. Opened my mind to modern essays and the variety of tools used in the modern essay. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course really instills a strong attention to detail when developing one's craft. The ability to really examine each word, phrase, and sentence carefully and formulate them in a very deliberate manner is the main skill I have developed in this course. The use of clich, sentence structure, specific word choice, and the motivations and underlying meanings of wiring are all also areas in which I've developed new and more learned perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0How to write. How to read. How to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to confidently reflect on, and write about, my life experiences and ideas. I learned how to read and to model great non-fiction writing, as well as how to give feedback on my peer's work. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was taught to be more confident in my writing and I learned several things about the editing process (the most useful thing being that sometimes if something isnt working out, just delete it!). ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing skills and learnt how to write different kinds of essays. ",
            "\u00a0My approach to writing fundamentally changed with this class. By reading well-written personal essays and practicing writing, you start to treat your writing with more care. I think the best thing that the class taught me was that writing is difficult. It isn't going to come easy to you or anyone, and that's why you need to work painstakingly to make sure each word, punctuation mark, and formatting choice has a meaningful purpose. Good writing comes to those who accept that the endeavor is difficult and are willing to take on that challenge nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to organize my writing more clearly, and pay close attention to word choice. ",
            "\u00a0Nonfiction writing also has room for creativity. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my essay writing skills as well as my ability to read famous essays and incorporate tactics they use to improve my own writing. I also sharpened my skills as a peer editor. I learned about what makes a good essay and simple tools to strengthen my writing. "

            "\u00a0Discussion among peers and instructor was one of the most rewarding and intellectually stimulating aspects of the course (besides the actual writing and learning). Not much to complain about, but some of the readings were a little repetitive in terms of content/issues. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are in the extremely careful attention to detail students give to their readings, their own works, and to the works of others in the course. The opportunities to obtain expert advice on one's wiring due to the professor's close reading of each student's works are invaluable. A weakness iff the course would be the lack of variance in what occurs during the class itself. The hour and 15 minutes of class time is devoted exclusively to verbally discussing the readings, with nearly no opportunities to write in class or perform other kinds of activities that aren't centered on long-winded discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Reading selection was great\r\nWeakness: Lack of consistent feedback on writing, dry discussion question \"springboards\" ",
            "\u00a0120 is the best intro English class. The reading assignments are engaging and the topics covered are relevant to young people. The writing assignments are open-ended and an exciting way to reflect on one's life. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is fine the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the homework readings and the writing process. I think that the homework readings are diverse enough in style for students to find the voice they want to emulate in their own writing. For me, it was E.B. White. For others, it might have Joan Didion or Wayne Koestenbaum. The point is that we all had the opportunity to read different types of good writing, and the value of reading cannot be underestimated. I also think that the availability of Professor Menke and numerous meetings throughout the writing process really helped to guide me through each step of the writing process. Frequent meetings with Professor Menke forced me to constantly reevaluate my thought process and writing, and I believe I produced better essays as a result.\r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this course was workshopping. Workship was nice to get the opinions of the other students in the class, but the deadline for the final draft was often too close to the workshop. So, it became difficult to make big changes, and most workshop comments were then confined to stylistic tweaks or grammar issues. Big-picture, overarching comments tended to be left untouched. I think reworking the timeline of essays would benefit the workshop component of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the workshop format and interesting assigned readings. My only suggested change would be to cut back on the amount of Zinsser. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it is a unique course and promotes creative methods to complete essays and also treaches good writing. It is fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any. ",
            "\u00a0This course has you constantly writing. I think that is a strength though because it gives you a lot of practice writing essays about a variety of topics. I also think having workshops so your peers can edit and provide feedback on your writing is another strength. A weakness of this course might be some of the additional readings that we did. Some of the essays we read weren't as interesting or didn't add much to my own skills as a writer. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! Take it. You really learn to have fun in writing and develop an appreciation for meticulousness that goes into a work. ",
            "\u00a0I would indeed recommend this course to another student, as I believe and Yale undergraduate who wants to improve his/her wiring skills, particularly in the realm of creative non-fiction, ought to take this course. I would recommend it to a student of any major. I think ENGL 120 at Yale really provides a great opportunity to learn how to write well. ",
            "\u00a0If you must you must. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, but with a different instructor. 120 is a seminal experience and I think, more than being a Writing credit, it's a great introduction to college-level discussion and thinking. Don't take it with a Grad student. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of prospective major I think that it is really useful to learn to write about REAL things, as this course teaches. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as it taught me how to write clearly, and allowed me to reflect on different aspects of my life. ",
            "\u00a0Every student who comes to Yale should take English 120. The skills you learn through English 120 (the whole approach to writing, learning to write about personal subjects, etc.) are extremely applicable later in life. English 120 forces you to reevaluate how you approach an essay and how you observe the world around you. It makes you more mindful of the people, places, and stories that you come across every day. Some people come to Yale thinking that they're good writers; others come in thinking the opposite. But everyone, with a proper amount of effort, will leave the class a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was entertaining, my writing improved a lot, and I got to know the people in my seminar well. ",
            "\u00a0It's fun and effective. It teaches good writing while allowing room for personal creativity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent introduction to essay writing. Writing is important in anything you do so I would definitely recommend taking this course to improve your writing skills and build new ones. "
