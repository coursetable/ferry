            "\u00a0Super interesting course! I learned a lot about what is important for a college level paper, and she was always very clear about how to improve my work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the structure of the essay that Yale mandates that its students write. Honestly, I do not think my writing has improved by a large degree, but I did learn about a few tips to enhance my writing.\r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about the topic of the course, which is art movements after World War II and how to receive them. I think modern art is pretty cool, so I enjoyed learning about the intellectual justifications behind modern art movements. ",
            "\u00a0academic writing (humanities-oriented); being able to make as much sense of readings(and doing it fast) on topics I'm uncomfortably underexposed to; a general concept of what is going on in art since 1940, with a focus on abstract expressionism and minimalism. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Some of the readings were assigned without much importance... We didn't go over a lot of them, or didn't use them in our work. But, some of the readings we focused a lot on and those discussions were really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Discussions were very engaging. But most importantly, meeting people in the course was very good. I do not think any of us were English-inclined people at all, we had three international students, three student athletes, et cetera. But I do not think I would have met my great classmates in any other context, so I'm glad this class allowed me to do that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Watching a 3-hour movie outside of class about a woman doing chores is not exactly the way I want to spend a Thursday night ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: definitely a good balance between content(art) delivery and writing practices; readings are wide-ranging yet in-depth when it comes to minimalism and critiques surrounding it; classroom discussions were guided effectively for best productivity and they generally tend to be clarificatory and inspiring (especially when the reading is difficult)\r\n\r\nWeakness: probably not very friendly to people who have not touched aesthetics/modern art before; some readings are very challenging and perhaps some form of summary/annotation would be very helpful "

            "\u00a0Yep! This is a super interesting course if you are interested in modern art and need something for a writing credit! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. English 114 allows you to develop as a writer, while learning about a topic that is not necessarily related to literature or poetry, like english classes of high school. Since a lot of people take English 114, it provides an additional thing to talk about in discussing schoolwork or intellectual topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are somewhat interested in art/art criticism/ aesthetic theory but do not yet wish to venture with a hardcore criticism course. ",
