            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Korean vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing skills, and practiced them with my fellow classmates. This class is definitely a bit more oriented towards writing and reading. You get a lot of practice writing if you put in the work for it. I learned more about how to express myself as a person in Korean, which is really cool! ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning in-depth vocabulary and grammar structures for multiple topics, this course was structured to expose students to Korean culture as frequently as possible. From a drama series we watched and debated to reading essays and learning songs, this course was conducive to developing contextual interpersonal language skills and writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic grammatical stuctures and loads of useful vocabulary. I learned how to formally write in Korean after growing up as a heritage speaker. ",
            "\u00a0My Korean definitely improved -- spelling and grammar for sure. ",
            "\u00a0Korean speaking, listening comprehension, and useful vocabularies ",
            "\u00a0a lot of vocabulary, grammar rules, more writing styles "

            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, there is a lot of room to engage with course material both in and outside of class. I found that learning grammar was very easy in class because we would practice and learn every aspect of the grammar clearly, and had a fairly straightforward system with daily vocabulary quizzes and such. I felt that the class was easy to keep up with and follow. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I believe this class was not very well-oriented for learning speaking or listening. Those who needed more practice speaking or understanding Korean did not get to practice those skills as much as I wish we could have. I also think the course was disorganized at times. While Professor Choi regularly sent out weekly schedules, the documents themselves were not very well-organized, and were often confusing to follow. I was often confused about what our assignments were exactly and how to do them. I think the course could benefit from hiring a student worker to help organize some of the documents and worksheets that are used in this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful for reviewing and learning critical grammar and vocabulary for improved communication skills and writing abilities. One area perhaps where this course could be improved is in expanding opportunities for practicing oral communication. It may be helpful to have oral language tests throughout the semester and more frequent in-class debates. Additionally, one weakness with this course was the variation in language abilities of the students. With some heritage speakers and some returning Light fellows, there were often gaps in prior knowledge that could make some of the material redundant for more advanced learners. ",
            "\u00a0I thinkt the class was rather unstructured in terms of the vocabulary concepts discussed. Comparing this class to the L4 Spanish class I took, I wish this course more thoroughly went through grammaticual structures tense by tense and moved logically from grammatical structure to grammatical structure instead of teaching small phrases to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0The course contexts require quite a lot of student engagement and interaction, hope we can drill on the grammar structures more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Choi received her Ph.D in linguistics, and her explanations for grammar rules are not only insightful but also extremely helpful\r\n\r\nWeakness: I don't think I got that much speaking practice in class, so many of my friends commented on how my speaking got worse over the semester.  Also the korean drama watching is too difficult to fit in a Yale student's schedule. Also the learning environment seemed very judgmental (among the students) so it was difficult to participate. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who is great at speaking and listening and only wants to work on more writing and reading, or to heritage students who want to learn spelling and such. I would not recommend this course to a returning Light Fellow because I think this course is not suited for people who want to advance their speaking and writing abilities. I think the Korean department is severely lacking in a system that suits those who studied language in Korea with the Light Fellowship after L2 - there is no L3 class that properly suits our needs and really stimulates our learning. I really wish we had something more concrete after returning. The Korean program is expanding in terms of the number of students taking it, so hopefully there can be more courses going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students without a strong base in written and technical Korean skills. ",
            "\u00a0For the hertage speaker I would recommend starting in L1 if youw ant to learn Korean properly. I still have many bad habits that were not properly addressed. I believe starting at a lower level would gave given me a clearer conceptual idea of the language as I have with Spanish. That being said, this depends heavily on ones experience and ability. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm a heritage speaker, and this was the only Korean class I took at Yale. Even after one semester, my Korean (especially written) improved drastically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it would improve your Korean fluency. "
