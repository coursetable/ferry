            "\u00a0My speaking, reading, and writing skills definitely improved a ton through daily usage. I learned more complex grammar structures but it was my improvement in other areas that felt most noticeable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about spanish grammar. More importantly, I had the opportunity to listen and speak a lot of spanish. ",
            "\u00a0My fluidity in reading and writing Spanish has improved. I have also improved as a speaker (especially with respect to my confidence and pronunciation) and a listener. It was also fun to read the works of so many great Spanish authors and experience Spanish in a more realistic way. ",
            "\u00a0Improved spanish grammar and writing ",
            "\u00a0Truly gained an incredibly high level of Spanish. In all four major aspects the course seeks out to instil. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish writing skills improved greatly because of the three in-class compositions. Id suggest keeping these assignments in the curriculum and definitely keeping them in-class essays instead of take-home essays. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish definitely improved! "

        [
            "\u00a0Because it meets daily your skills improve a lot, but this also can be quite demanding, especially on days where homework is strangely longer. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, great course. Good homework and constant engagement. Good balance between grammar and other forms of more \"natural\" exposure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- LOTS of practice writing\r\n- Many opportunities to speak with other people in Spanish\r\n- This class, in general, was a great place to practice Spanish\r\n- Really helpful for helping me to improve my grammar\r\n- Amazing feedback on written assignments\r\n- Many fun readings and short movies\r\n- Not too intense\r\n- Course notebook, as always, was excellent\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Supersite exercises often had very unclear instructions, making them unnecessarily hard to do; I've never had so many issues with Supersite until this semester (I've taken two other Spanish courses with much better results), so it may be worthwhile to assess the quality of this course's exercises\r\n- My class was pretty large, making it harder to participate (since we had to share participation time between so many people)\r\n- Feedback on spoken Spanish wasn't very common (spoken Spanish was only really corrected if the same mistake was made repeatedly), though that may have been purposeful to avoid interrupting our fluidity ",
            "\u00a0Work sometimes felt like busywork.  I wish there was more focus on interacting with spanish-source media ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very exacting. It demanded excellence to an extreme degree. \r\nWeaknesses: this demand was sometimes life-dominating. Grading could seem very arbitrary, especially having to do with who your partner was on group projects. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of busywork but educational ",
            "\u00a0I loved reading Las Batallas and watching the movies. I would keep all of those in the curriculum. Maybe the one exception was the movie No because watching it out-of-class was very difficultthe link to the movie that we were given didnt always work and I ended up having to download and pay for the movie. ",
            "\u00a0too much surprise homeworkwork/homework that was not listed on the syllabus ",

            "\u00a0For those interested in improving their spanish, absolutely. You also read/watch some interesting pieces of spanish culture. I would recommend this course only to those interested in improving their abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it's a great way to start applying your knowledge of Spanish in a more realistic way, without necessarily taking an L5 course. It's also a great place to refine your Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0I guess, but only to fulfill language requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take L4 Spanish. And, Leon is someone who really cares, always offering office hours and ready to help. It's still extremely exacting even if you take advantage of all of these opportunities. Tread carefully. ",
            "\u00a0If you think you can speak spanish you're probably wrong. You will learn, though. Very little education in spoken spanish, definetly an emphasis on written so better hope you're good at that. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to a student who wants to see their Spanish speaking and writing skills improve greatly (to say that this class accomplished that is an understatement). Professor Len is also really sweet and makes herself very accessible for any help you might need. ",
