Beyond the assignments, though, the class lectures delved into deeper understandings of how we go about conservation and how we can seek to reconcile conservation needs with that of development priorities. Overall, I think this course was a good foundation and one I hope to build on in further study. "

While I think I learned a lot from this class, I'm not sure it really met my expectations in understanding how to go about such projects \"in the real world.\" While our semester-long project was centered around Jasper National Park, and while we had a call early in the semester, this failed to become the sort of direct client project that I think many students had hoped it would be, and this lack of insight into what they wanted and also in some cases the lack of clear information contributed to the project feeling a lot more than just a class project, rather than a real-world application of the tools and knowledge we were learning about.

            "\u00a0The content about conservation science and landscape planning was great. \r\n\r\nThe level of instruction about the assignments and how to apply these principles needs more work. First, the timing is off. For example, we had a class focused on our 4th assignment before spring break when we were working on the 3rd assignment that was due after break. This can be fixed by a simple re-ordering of classes.\r\n\r\nI would recommend a few classes focusing specifically on how to go about the technical sides to the project. Time was unnecessarily wasted trying to figure out how to make the software work instead of actually learning about how to apply the outputs from the software. For example, there was a problem with the R code for assignment #3 and for people who do not know R, we did not have the skills to know how to fix this. This does not need to be recreated each year. Just send the code that worked last class to the next class. There should be a more step-by-step guidelines for the assignments- this would focus the learning on the data and how it can be utilized.\r\n\r\nThe class also needs more technical support. One TA is not enough due to the high level of errors. Perhaps if there was a step-by-step guide, one TA would be  enough but if the class is kept as it is now, there needs to be another TA. ",
            "\u00a0The timing of the assignments and the lectures was misaligned. I'd like more instruction about the overall project at the beginning of the semester. That being said, the class is definitely worth it if you are going into conservation, wildlife, science, land management, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Took much time and effort. I thought better coordination with client could have been improved. ",
            "\u00a0this is the most well organized class I've taken at FES. the lectures were thought provoking and filled with important information. The end product and assignments will help me in my career outside of FES ",
            "\u00a0The course is very complete, and provides both science and policy concepts for species conservation. ",
            "\u00a0More in class work time to get help on small fixes that otherwise take hours ",
            "\u00a0The final paper is actually quite different from the other assignments and it feels a bit rushed at the end. There was also a bit of a disconnect between the timing of workshops when we were learning new software and when we actually had to use the software for homework assignments. Other than a stressful final project, I'm very happy with the course. ",
            "\u00a0As discussed previously, I liked that the course questions current conservation strategies, and posed alternatives to how scientists tackle conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nA strong weakness is the lack of clear requirements needed of students before they take this course. This class lists GIS as a skill that is beneficial for students to have before taking this course. Before shopping period started, I asked the professor which GIS should students know about (vector vs raster) and he said either is fine. This turned out not to be accurate. I came in with only vector GIS experience, and most (if not all) of the GIS work was raster-based. Vector and raster are very different, and there were a lot of tools that we had to use in GIS that I was not familiar with. Yes the TA and my group members were there to ask questions, but I still feel the professor should have been more clear about what GIS knowledge was needed.\r\n\r\nWe also used R, and while students may have been able to get away with not knowing R before taking this course, I think making it clear that knowing a little about R before taking this class would also have been very beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The class is extremely well-taught by Os and gives students many technical skills to make them more effective conservationists and (I suspect) more attractive candidates for employment. \r\n\r\nThe course workload is, in my opinion, greater than what I associate with 4 credits.  It certainly required more time than Ecosystems and Landscapes, which is worth 5 credits.  I also found Guiseppe's guest lectures (to familiarize us with some of the programs we needed for our assignments) to be pretty terrible.  He was difficult to understand, particularly since many of us were learning about these complex concepts for the first time.  He moved through the material much too quickly and seemed to assume that we were already familiar with the basics of the programs being discussed which was not the case for all but one of the first years.  These technical lectures were also staggered oddly out of sync with our assignments.  For example, we would learn about Circuitscape (for assignment 3) while we were still struggling to complete assignment 2, which required us to work with MaxEnt.  By the time assignment 3 actually came around, it had been weeks since our Circuitscape lecture with Giuseppe and much of what he had discussed was hard to remember. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures, assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough office hours with the TAs, could have used more workshopping of R for the last assignment ",
            "\u00a0Really great course, but there's so much packed into it. I think it could be expanded to two or three course. I could have spent my whole time here learning what was taught in this class. There need to be more classes like it because its kind of absurd this is all packed into a single course offered every two years. Students interested in wildlife and landscape conservation just don't have the opportunities needed to become well-rounded practitioners. That being said, the class was extremely difficult if you didn't have a strong grounding in some very specific prerequisites (which was most of the class). There was a lot to learn a tiny time period and many of the students didn't feel they had the tools they needed. That being said, this is NOT the professors fault. I think F&ES needs to do a better job of offering similar classes that build off each other. ",
            "\u00a0This course is one of the best I have taken at FES. The only thing I would recommend is finding a new GIS instructor, or more tightly regulating how the current GIS instructor teaches.\r\n\r\nOs delegates the GIS portions of the class to the two teaching assistants. Ethan Miller was an amazing TA overall, but the task of actually teaching how to perform the GIS and spatial modeling work fell to the other TA (who specialized in GIS). However, the GIS instructor did not perform adequately. He failed to explain how particular spatial distribution programs that were required for assignments worked, preferring instead to lecture about how to perform these same procedures via coding practices in R. This would have been fine if students understood what these programs were and how they worked, but he skipped over those instructions and went straight to R instead. This left students confused and unable to actually perform their assignments -- because they had no idea what the programs were supposed to be doing. R was unnecessary for most of these assignments, so students would instead follow instructions online for how to use these programs. Once they hit a bug or obstacle, they would go to the GIS teaching fellow for help, who would instead lecture them about using R instead and make them start over. This created 2 problems: first, the students would be unable to figure out what they were supposed to do; second, even if a student figured out how to replicate their work in R they would still be unable to pass the bug or obstacle they had hit in the first place.\r\n\r\nI recommend a more structured approach to the assignments, particularly when teaching Maxent. The first assignment using Maxent (assignment 2) should be explained using only the Maxent GUI provided by the American Museum of Natural History and with ArcGIS as the method to create the environmental variables. R should never be mentioned at this stage. This will allow the students to figure out what the program does and how it works with methods that are more familiar and user-friendly. Then, once this foundation is in place, the second Maxent assignment (assignment 4) should then bring in how to use R (since it is impossible to do this assignment without R). Students will understand what they are doing and will be able to focus on how to translate their understanding of the Maxent GUI to the R code. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is meant to be very practical and actually look at hard skills and tools that you could use in the real world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Students aren't really taught how to use any of the tools, they are merely told that the tools exist and then thrown into an assignment that uses the tools. So many of us spent WAAAAAY too long trying to just figure out how to use a software which is simply a waste of our time. We would have spent a fraction of the time and learned more if we would have first been shown how to actually use the software and then given the assignment. I don't really feel like I learned any of the tools. I simply fudged them until something came out without really understanding or being able to replicate it in the future. Also, there should be like 3 TAs for the course and they should all know how to use the software. It is really unhelpful when the TA can't really help you and when you are really struggling to figure something out but there's no one available to help. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are largely theoretical, while the homework assignments are technical and not always supported by the lectures. The workshops, designed to support the technical work of the homework, were largely unhelpful. The course follows a \"learn by doing\" model, which is great, except that many of the details of the computer programs we learned are specifics not easily figured out by experimentation (ex. specifics of input file formatting). The constant trial and error [messages] took the focus away from learning. More guidance on the technical aspects would have allowed deeper understanding of the concepts behind the tools. One of the challenges of this class is the broad range of skill sets that people come in with. If GIS and R prerequisites are not enforced, intro to GIS or R workshops should be mandatory for people who don't have any experience with those tools. The in-class workshops were consistently at the wrong level for many students in class and were frustrating and confusing rather than informative. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it gives you a working familiarity with the most widespread methods for conservation science. The downside is that the course instructors do not teach the software or program materials themselves, so the students need to self-teach the programs to themselves. This was a double-edged, because it was extremely time-consuming and overwhelming to trouble-shoot, identify errors, and figure out how to process the data on our own, but by working through the kinks ourselves, we also learned how to process data and use the programs much more thoroughly.

I think the insights gained from this class can be great, and I think this class is absolutely necessary for anyone interested in practical conservation, and I think a reworking - one that better prepares students, gives better guidance to tackling the assigned questions, and better incorporates the really interesting lectures with the technical skills addressed in the assignments, would be fantastic.
