            "\u00a0Watched a lot of movies but felt like we could have seen a more diverse picture of hollywood / LA and read more critique ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Hollywood and the common themes and tropes found in classical Hollywood narratives. Professor Musser offered unique insights as someone who has seen and worked in Hollywood. This class works more the dissect this one major topic than a specific deep analysis of each text/film. "

            "\u00a0felt unclear about what we were supposed to take away. Felt like we just celebrates hollywood movies n books n drew connections btwn them but couldnt figure out the overall idea ",
            "\u00a0The class exposes you to a lot of Hollywood movies and texts you may not otherwise watch or read. However, it is not always easy to engage with these works to the extent needed for an in depth discussion if you do not have an understanding of Hollywoods key participants throughout the twentieth century. It would be helpful to establish specific themes or narratives for students to pay attention to starting in the very first class, because the movies and texts can sometimes seem surface level if you do not enter the class without background knowledge.

            "\u00a0If the student is interested particularly in the development of the narrative of Hollywood - not just Hollywood movies but actually the way Hollywood represents itself. The beginning of the course is heavy on silent films, and the syllabus does not include some of the expected classics. The discussions can wander a bit and do not always feel targeted. Students should go to class with certain discussion ideas. "
