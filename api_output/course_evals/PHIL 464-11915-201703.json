            "\u00a0knowledge of vocabulary of financial integrity and tax justice, awareness on interdisciplinary nature of the topic, ability to link themes in a research paper ",
            "\u00a0I heard from a lot of different experts (who were literally the people making decisions and doing primary investigation of the issues of the course) about their experience with various matters of financial integrity. This was a unique experience. I don't think I learned a ton cohesively. I don't exactly know what to tell my parents when they asked about what I learned except for \"well, there's a lot of corruption, shady business, and tax evasion going on and nobody pays attention or cares which sucks.\" So I feel glad to have taken it but don't really know exactly what I got out of it.

            "\u00a0great guests, would have perhaps been good to have more time for student discussion and questions with guests rather than presentations. presentations were sometimes summaries of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely interesting guests, which is not a common opportunity.\r\n\r\nI wish that we had been able to participate more. The idea of seminars is that they are so long and meet only once a week so that people can interact and participate. Students very rarely spoke except maybe to ask one question per session. Therefore it was like 110 minutes of lecture. And that can get a bit dry especially because the material has a lot of data which you get tired of looking at. So I wish we could have engaged more.\r\n\r\nJim Henry's lectures were pretty boring and unengaging. Thomas Pogge seems like a much more competent and engaging lecturer and I would have loved to hear more from him instead. Especially for the philosophy side of it... \r\n\r\nIf I had taken this course without knowing its course number, I'd never have guessed it was a PHIL course. Like there was almost no PHIL done. And there was a decent amount of ECON understanding necessary--I'd say you really need to have had intermediate macro to fully understand a lot of what was going on. So if you're a PHIL major be prepared for something very different from what you'd expect in a PHIL seminar.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm completely baffled by how 30% of the course grade could be participation--we almost never had the opportunity to participate!

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course -- great guests, good readings, made me critical. However, there is a substantial final project to be aware of. ",
            "\u00a0I really don't know. The first session made me think it would be more structured and focused on certain themes than it was. It was basically like a bunch of people coming to share experience--more like a lecture series with a common factor than an actual course. The lonnnnnngggggg term paper was essentially research for credit, since it could be on anything and there wasn't much in the course to go on unless one of the speakers' topics really struck a chord, but then still you'd have to do a lot more research to write 7000+ words about it. Also kind of sucks to write 10,000 words in a course at minimum and not get a WR out of it.\r\n\r\nSo if the material really interests you, then consider it. Though know that it will be a struggle to understand the lectures if you aren't versed in macroeconomics (I'd say almost to intermediate level and maybe metrics too), though this doesn't necessarily hurt your performance in the course since you can write on anything. You won't get any grade feedback at all, so it's a bit of a leap of faith to take it for a letter grade. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't feel like a PHIL course nor like a seminar, and yet that's what it was. So it's an oddball, but if it's an oddball that interests you, then there will be a lot of thrilling opportunities to connect with some of the people with the most experience in this field. "
