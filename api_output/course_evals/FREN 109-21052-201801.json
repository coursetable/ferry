            "\u00a0I learned essential aspects of French grammar, such as the present tense, the future tense, the conditional present, the subjunctive present and the imperative. I learned a lot of vocabulary and read important texts of French culture in French, such as texts from Voltaire. Prof. Sanjabi is very knowledgeable about French culture and history and she also provides her own valuable opinions on the philosophers or authors we read. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to translate written French into written English very well. Knowledge of the conventions of such translations. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Sanjabi taught me from no comprehension of French to the ability to understand rather difficult works. ",
            "\u00a0Having known almost no French before the course began, I can now fairly comfortably read French in my discipline, and I can read French in other disciplines, news, and literature at a slower pace using a dictionary more frequently. ",
            "\u00a0I gained greater confidence in my french reading and translation abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read French with a dictionary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very much about the French language in this course and believe that I attained the goal of the course: the acquire reading fluency in French. "

            "\u00a0I liked this course. We followed the schedule closely and Prof. Sanjabi gave us weekly tasks about translating texts and doing exercises related to the grammatical concepts that we discussed the previous time. The exams were similar to the tasks we received. We could use notes and vocabularies, which made it all better. I really appreciate how organized Prof. Sanjabi was throughout the course. The fact that I had to choose a text to translate and provide a summary about it before spring break helped me. ",
            "\u00a0A miracle course for passing foreign language assessment exams. The course is straightforwardthe expectations are very clearand your improvement will be obvious.\r\n\r\nIt can be repetitive, which can make it difficult to keep up with throughout the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Sanjabi provides great resources, reasonable pacing, and productive class time. The book is extremely helpful, and Dr. Sanjabi fills in its gaps and provides practical help. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-designed. ",
            "\u00a0The professor, Maryam, was absolutely wonderful. She did a fantastic job of approaching the material and made each class very accessible and structured. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. There were students who were completely new to French and Prof. Sanjabi supported them. I have a lot of respect for Prof. Sanjabi for her encouragement of students who had not seen French before. She made sure to also emphasize confusing aspects of the language. There were translations in which we made us stop to think about how a certain idiom could be translated, since she predicted that because of the word structure, we would interpret it in a way different from the correct one and she was often right. ",
            "\u00a0If you need to learn to translate French, yes. If not, no. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially if the prospect of being able to read French fairly proficiently in the space of a semester seems appealing to them. I entered this course with no knowledge of French whatsoever and can read French policy papers now. Professor Sanjabi is really awesome -- takes the time to help you, and is funny and creates a great atmosphere for the class. The material is super thorough and as long as you put in the work, it's absolutely effective. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dr. Sanjabi puts a lot of effort into the course and is extremely accessible for help. Learning a language this quickly is an incredible time-value. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provides effective instruction in French reading and translation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you need to learn to read French. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think it was beneficial for students looking to refine their understanding of French, as well as those looking to acquire knowledge about a totally unfamiliar language. "
