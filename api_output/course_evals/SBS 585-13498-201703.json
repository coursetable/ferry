            "\u00a0Ali is so engaging and knowledgeable. Her passion for the topics she covers is evident, and I learned a great deal about the complexities of human rights, gender, and sexuality particularly when it comes to advocacy and the law. I felt that given today's political climate around reproductive and LGBTQ rights, this course was especially important to take. I enjoyed the book report assignment, and though I wish I could have chosen my own topic for the op-ed, I learned a lot from both exercises, finding my voice, etc. However, the course which was originally supposed to be a seminar became a lecture very quickly, and I wish there was more opportunity for students to engage in the conversation and share their unique perspectives, as I know we had students from many different backgrounds in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This was far and away my favorite course this term. I loved the enthusiasm and wealth of knowledge of the professor, the interdisciplinary and social science-based nature of the course, and the mix of students in the class. The diversity of students from different schools across Yale was extremely valuable in helping me understand the material from a variety of perspectives and get a sense of Yale beyond the public health school. The professor was the most obviously enthusiastic about the course topic and her students that I have seen at Yale, and the combination of her enthusiasm and the course content made me look forward to the class all week. The workload was challenging but not overwhelming, and the material is vital I think for any public health student. I hope to have a class this good every term I am here. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent, timely, interdisciplinary examination of sexuality, gender, health and human rights. A LOT of reading but mostly worthwhile. For non-law students without a background in human rights discourse, some of the topics could feel intimidating. But Ali Miller does a great job eliciting multiple perspectives and the resulting discussion is rich. ",
            "\u00a0I was craving some way to understand sexuality and gender better and Professor Miller's course and command of the material was astoundingly helpful. While the reading was heavy, each reading was picked to be a dense, well-researched, well-written door into a whole world of further research. Thus each week was an excellent, quick survey of a whole subfield. The assignments were well designed and useful for translating the sometimes heavy theory into meaningful application. I grew as a student and as a person taking this course and I cannot recommend it highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a lot great information in it, but sometimes the information was difficult to follow. "

            "\u00a0Amazing teacher. The most dynamic, engaging lectures and intellectually-stimulating course material. Her passion and expertise is clear. ",
            "\u00a0I was extremely impressed by Professor Miller's teaching, background and knowledge, and I very much appreciated her enthusiasm and excitement about the course. She clearly cares deeply about this material, and she let her commitment to it be felt by the students in the room. I appreciated her willingness to listen to students, her commitment to running a small, discussion-style class, and her social science-based approach to public health work.\r\n\r\nProfessor Miller was also the most supportive professor of my work outside of class that I have encountered so far at Yale. She met individually with students regularly to offer support in her class and in our time at Yale overall, and she stayed after class to speak with students on a wide variety of topics each week. I appreciated how much energy she devoted to getting to know her students, and to supporting our various research interests. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Miller is a master teacher. Her course was expertly thought-out and each class was carefully structured to cover specific major points. Although the course was set up as a seminar, it was a bit big for true seminar-style discussion. Nevertheless, Professor Miller engaged students in each class and managed to cover a huge amount of material with ease and warmth. She handled scheduling issues and missed assignments in a way that always put her students' development first. Feedback was timely and helpful. Professor Miller's course was one of the best I've ever taken and I'm sad that it's over. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Miller is a wonderful instructor. Her lectures were illuminating, oftentimes moving, and always thoughtful. She was always willing to take the time to meet with me. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Miller is very knowledgable, but sometimes her class discussions are difficult to follow because there are many themes involved. "

            "\u00a0I would - and have - highly recommended this course to fellow students. I tell them the instructor is brilliant and fascinating, the small class size is fantastic, and the interdisciplinary mix of students and approaches is unique in courses I have taken so far at Yale. I tell them to expect to work hard and love the material. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. This course gives a survey of sexuality, gender, and health as they figure in human rights. The first weeks offer a theoretical basis for understanding sexuality, gender, health, and human rights. Later weeks offer an overview of subfields within human rights: intersex, rape, sex work, etc. I highly recommend this course for students in almost any field as it questioned many of my assumptions and prompted me to think about the world differently. One of the strengths was that both the readings and the students came from a variety of disciplines. I especially recommend the course for those in the health professions, where education on these topics can be paltry. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good overview on sexuality and gender studies. if students are interested in those topics, they should take it. However, they may be confused due to the wide range and depths of the topics, at times. "
