I feel like it could be improved by starting with a philosophical foundation into \"What is the state? and \"What is politics?\" and \"Why do humans need to live under a state?\" etc. This is what I was expecting from an intro to political philosophy class. These questions came later as we read other philosophers, but only tangentially, and were only really ever addressed in section. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: texts, there was great depth in the texts we were assigned. We had to read many of the classic political thinkers, but we also had the opportunity to read a couple more contemporary thinkers who provided a more diverse background like MLK Jr, Du Bois, and Arendt. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it could be improved by letting students have more agency in creation of ideas and in the discussions, instead of staying so rooted to the textual evidence. ",

",
            "\u00a0I feel like we went over everything so quickly that we didn't really do justice by any of it. I think the course should be narrowed so we can adequetly discuss the thinkers. I also don't think that the two papers reflected the range of ideas we discussed. Maybe have 3 or 4 papers and no final? Also, too much reading during some weeks. The long passages from Tocqueville could've been condensed and still captured the important ideas. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that it was a good general introduction. A weakness was that there was an unreasonable amount of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is not too engaging and information provided is not always supplementary to the readings, but rather repetition.\r\nWriting intensive section does not truly focus on how to write better other than the two big essay papers assigned.\r\n\r\nstrengths: material is relevant and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Landemore was engaging and demonstrated a mastery of political theory. Vatsal as a TF was the best!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have used more inter-text engagement during the lectures. ",

I really enjoyed the background knowledge on what sort of ideas were big in science or culturally while the philosophers where writing and how that impacted their own thinking. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were good and the sections were good. In general, a good course with some flaws. The lectures were a bit too much like a seminar style class which is hard with 80 students.\r\n\r\nIt can be improved by standardizing grading across TFs. Writing and papers are already subjective but then subjectivity is added to subjectivity when different TFs are grading across WI and regular sections. However, i still did get good feedback. ",

Although at first I found the lectures interesting as Id never taken a philosophy class before, however, as the year went on, the lectures grew more boring and I retained barely any information making finals studying a lot. ",

            "\u00a0This course attempts to cover a large volume of texts in a short period of time. It made it very difficult for me to spend the necessary amount of time studying each text. Ultimately I felt rushed and wish the pace could have been a bit more reasonable so that I could properly analyze each text. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really engaging. The reading was a lot, I would recommend trimming down the parts of each book that we read so that students can read those parts in depth rather than skimming long sections of text. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this class is its sheer volume of reading; covering such a wide range of authors, I never felt too engaged in any one author that we were focusing on--by the end of the week we had already moved on to the next one. \r\nThat being said, Professor Landemore and the Teaching Fellows did an excellent job of giving students a decent grasp of each author despite the constricted time limit and the quick pace of the class. Any student should walk away with a basic understanding of upwards of ten authors. This is an impressive feat, in my opinion. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Good to have a base in political philosophy before taking further courses (for example Classics of EP&E), even though I feel the course could be improved as I before explained. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. If you are super interested in the topics, sure I think you would enjoy the class. I just didn't find the lectures to be that interesting. ",

This is a survey course that provides you with the opportunity to learn about many of the most popular political philosophers who will surely be brought up throughout your other courses.  At the end of the day, even if political philosophy isn't exactly your cup of tea, you'll walk away smarter and more capable of sustaining an intelligent conversation relating to political theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think at the end of the day the class is kind of a pain, but it definitely makes sense if you are at all interested in philosophy or politics (which you all should be). Take it. You can get away without doing the readings if you really don't want to. It's a good introduction to political philosophy. You won't have fun, but you'll survive and be better for it. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really into reading a bunch of different political books and analyzing everyone else's ideas, then yes. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course will help flesh out contingencies one may have, I think, with the current affairs of international politics and regime types. By taking a look into some of the founding individuals in this field, one will walk away with a great appreciation and understanding regarding the original purposes behind the wide array of regime types. ",

            "\u00a0I would probably not recommend this course to another student. There was way too much reading, so if you like that then sure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- if you want to learn about political thought and read through much of the Western canon. As a science major, this was a welcome change in programming. However, thinking on a different level of abstraction was challenging, but a worthwhile one. Even if you don't need this course for EP&E requirements, it's worth it to take it if you have the course flexibility! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am glad that I took this class because it is always good to have knowledge of authors like the ones discussed in class (Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, etc.). While lecture isn't amazing, it is sufficiently helpful. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the books that are listed then, yes. The course is not too difficult and the essay titles are actually quite interesting. Lecture and section are fine, but you will only find the class rewarding if you are interested in reading and understanding the books, because it's very much focused on the books. The readings are not that long, and if you want to do some reading of classic books of political philosophy this is a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if they are interested in a foundational course in politics. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Very good, although difficult. Expect to work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but probably do not take writing intensive unless you're sure of the time commitment. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It is informative but fairly low-commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it was a great class for any student interested in government and politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it gives a good overview of political philosophy for those that have never read any before. ",
            "\u00a0I would but only if they had the intention of majoring in political science/philosophy. Other than that its not the most exciting course in PLSC offered. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have ample time to read the texts. Some weeks had very heavy loads of reading and it is necessary to read the texts to succeed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! While philosophy and the western cannon aren't really my favorite thing, Prof. Landemore made it really engaging and I feel like I gained a great knowledge base that I can apply in the future. I really feel like a learned Ivy League scholar now that I can name drop all sorts of philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! This class is an excellent introduction into the world of Political Philosophy. To anyone who is willing to spend hours reading, taking notes, and thinking deeply about the world around them: take this class! "
