            "\u00a0Learned to think about how DS is relevant to making impact on the world... furthered my belief in the profound nature of the individual human's experience to making global impact ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how current foreign affairs are influenced by foreign affairs of the past and how reading these ancient works informs a modern statesman. I also learned to recognize how authors debated with each other across centuries, and understanding these debates led to deeper in-class discussions as we contemplated together what these debates represented then and now. Through our paper writing, I also learned how to succinctly express my own argument while addressing the authors' extended argument. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a great, broad paper and look at difficult topics from a zoomed out perspective. This is an invaluable skill, especially in DS. Hill had us write essays that taught me to write and think in a way I will use for the rest of my life. His class helped me learn to think broadly and in terms of big topics and themes, rather than focusing on small details. He taught us how to make fascinating connections between texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make a tight, coherent, and modest argument. The class really emphasized drawing insight from both broad swaths of information and close readings of passages, and that felt really valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this class. I felt like I had a very good grasp of each book's extended argument while also learning where each book fit in the greater tradition of historical and political thought. I feel like I have gained a lot of useful skills for parsing historical books. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of different approaches to political thought in classical, medieval and renaissance Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about the growth of political thought from Ancient Greek times onward, and how to understand the implications of an author's style upon his work. Also, I learned how to write efficiently when given enormous prompts. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Professor Hill sometimes says things about texts and the way they're structured that will never leave you. Ever.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Discussion structure is too loose, disincentives doing the reading ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nvast array of authors and eras from which we read\r\ngreat discussion sections\r\nexcellent professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nI felt like the discussions were sometimes rushed or glossed over important aspects because of time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum didn't feel like it overall cohered as tightly as other DS courses did, where there felt like there was a very clear progression of thought, and that the authors were truly in dialogue with another. H+P felt more like a sampling of broadly but vaguely connected texts rather than one single tight tradition. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it was always interesting, and that we not only learned about each book on its own, but also focused a lot on each book as it related to every other book we read. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers lots of great material. Unlike  the other DS courses, though, it lacks a clear structure and the works rarely seem to relate to each other. The readings are also more boring (and longer) than other classes readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of this course was seeing the continuity and divisions between different authors over time. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great, loved the material. It was very difficult and required immense effort, but that's part of the experience, and I could not have learned as much had the course progressed at a slower pace. "

            "\u00a0Yes. But, I would warn against simply relying on class to learn the material and get the most out of the written material ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's work and a lot of reading, but DS is fulfilling. It's the ability to learn about our past to inform our present and future. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Hill made my first semester experience. I loved learning in his class. ",
            "\u00a0This question feels difficult to answer because of the nature of DS. Would I recommend DS to another student? Possibly, depending on their interests. I'd recommend to a DSer to try to get into Hill's section, though. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was interesting, and felt very worthwhile. I learned a lot in this class that I can apply to other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class, its good. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was well worth the difficulty for all I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hill's H&P section is a bit different from the others. He knows the answers, and will tell you the answers if he doesn't think the discussion is going in the right direction. Sometimes this is annoying; sometimes it's enlightening. "
