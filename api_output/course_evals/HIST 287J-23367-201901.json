            "\u00a0Insights into the lived experiences and social structures concerning sexual minorities through Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Case studies into specific European societies, focus largely on male same-sex sexual contact. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot from this course; please look at the syllabus. The seminar-style was great because everyone was able to pitch in their own ideas and contribute to a discussion for which there are no right answers and only a lot of questions and a lot of different points of view, both within history and within the class. It was nothing short of a fabulous experience. In particular, I took away a lot about how different societies de-essentialized sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first time taking a History course at Yale, and learned how to analyze the impact of perspective on history/the way we learn it; I learned to always consider the context of specific events, and to understand both the benefits and limits of looking at history with a modern perspective. For instance, I learned that it is nearly impossible to study the \"history of homosexuality,\" because homosexuality as we know it today cannot be conceptualized the same way in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of sodomy and male sexuality in general. I gained discussion techniques and was able to listen to interesting conversation and lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate historical sources form an unbiased perspective and to denormalize my assumptions about sexuality that might cause certain historical analyses to be anachronistic. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most thought-provoking and provocative course I've ever taken. During the first class when Igor warned that we would be talking not only about sex, but about body fluids, sexual positions, and a host of other details, I remember thinking \"why would we need to talk about that???\" but by the end of the course we had looked closely at all these things from an intellectual, theoretical, and empirical level, so much so that my question now is \"how do we study anything without talking about these things?\" "

            "\u00a0Strong seminar discussion. Entertaining and well-organized so the long seminars didn't feel overwhelming. Igor is a great professor, very few weaknesses. Readings mostly reasonable, definitely not all necessary, but interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great. The only suggestion for improvement is not with the class, but that there be a class just like it that covers other traditions (India, Thailand, Asia and the Near East, etc.). Often, I found myself thinking, 'this is awesome, but what about the rest of the world?'. This class is focused on western traditions; I'd recommend adding another one to WGSS/RLST without changing this one. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were relevant and very interesting, and fostered strong class discussion. I also felt that the assignments genuinely helped us learn and review the course material; we unfortunately did not get a chance to present our final projects, and I think that would have been both beneficial and fun for the entire class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the discussions. The class was full of intelligent and wonderful students. The weakness were the lecture part of the class that sometimes went on for too long. I also wished we had more variance in the structure of the class each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings, professor, organization of seminar, pacing\r\nWeaknesses: not enough discussion time ",

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course  I think the amount of time/work required translates very well to the amount of interesting, pertinent information one gains from taking it. It was well worth the time I put into it, and I gained a lot of knowledge and skills in historical analysis as a result. It was also particularly worthwhile for me as a WGSS major; I was able to learn more about the history of sexuality, which was a field I had not explored before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for someone looking for a great community to engage in discussion with and who is interested in learning about sodomy and its history. It is a semi-low intensity class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super interesting material and Igor is fun, knowledgable, and fair. Class always went by quickly because of interesting discussions. ",
