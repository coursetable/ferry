However, this course could have been so much more enjoyable than it was and I would highly recommend the MCDB Biochemistry to students who want a fair shot at a decent grade. I feel like the grading in this class was extremely unfair and unpredictable - the exams were definitely doable if you studied a ton but virtually no partial credit was given, and if your answer doesn't exactly conform to the Professors' answer keys, you'll get no credit, even if you present a valid line of reasoning. Likewise, only one question out of the whole pset is graded so if you happen to fail that question but do well on the rest of the pset, you will still end up with a terrible grade. Furthermore, Professor Koelle's much emphasized \"this course is not about the details but about the overarching concepts\" is totally false. This course is ALL ABOUT DETAILS. You have to memorize every single word of every slide to even have a shot at an ok grade on the exams. People put an inordinate amount of work into this class, which makes the curve very tough; much much worse than most other premed classes. Overall, these grading policies made this course extremely unenjoyable for me as I was constantly worrying about grades, which is a real shame as the material is very exciting. ",

The main concepts we should take away from lectures were well-defined. However, the amount of material can be overwhelming. It was helpful to have study guides which emphasized the details to learn, in addition to the big concepts, but it sometimes did feel like we had to have everything memorized, besides just details in the study guides. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in that it teaches a lot of content, and integrates it together well.  Additionally, the instructors are both fantastic and always accessible.  However, the course places a HUGE emphasis on exams and seems to focus on knowing all the material at a pretty cursory level in order to do well on these.  This makes the few days before the exam very stressful, but I feel like I engaged minimally with the material outside of these pre-exam periods (weekly homeworks required minimal thought and took ~30 minutes to complete).  It would be nice if the course could introduce some sort of project that is worked on throughout the semester, in which we'd explore a particular area of the material more deeply. ",

Pset questions were so easy that they were almost useless, although I guess the tradeoff is that the weekly pset workload was super low (30min). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it's pretty organized and straightforward, a lot of people to go to if you need help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The way the course evaluates students' knowledge is terrible. The grading is incredibly harsh and seems to take off points despite the answer being clear that the student understood the material for the most part. Points were taken off for missing incredibly specific phrases or words. The learning environment was also incredibly cutthroat and not enjoyable. Everyone is incredibly competitive which made the class extremely unenjoyable to take. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a LOT of material that I imagine will be helpful later, in other courses and with the MCAT. However, it was tragically boring, and the format of the course was poor. PSETs were too easy, and therefore didn't prepare us for the incredibly nit-picky exams. Midterms are worth too much, quizzes not enough. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Material is interesting. Lots of resources to ask questions etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a fan of the emphasis of memorization. They SAY it's concept-based but in reality you have to memorize a ton of random facts, and you're screwed over if you don't. ",

            "\u00a0The course was well organized, and the lectures had a sensible arc to them. Concepts were highlighted in numerous different ways, and the examples used illustrated these concepts well. The supplements at the end of lectures were incredibly interesting and it was nice to enjoy a 10-15 minute lecture on a topic on biochemistry without having to worry about knowing every detail on in for a future exam.\r\n\r\nThe amount of detailed knowledge expected of us made sense given the nature of the field of biochemistry, but the exams seemed to focus a little too heavily on minute details that were shown once on a lecture slide and not even discussed in great detail -- examples I could think of are that heme bH is the carrier that reduces Q(dot) to QH2, and that CN- inhibits complex IV of the electron transport chain. ",
            "\u00a0Too much information, lectures are impossible to get all the way through without feeling exhausted. That being said, the this isn't really the fault of the class but just the nature of this area of chem and bio. The information was presented fairly clearly and the fact that we got power points printed for us each class is a total game changer. ",
            "\u00a0The tests are super hard even if you study for hours and hours ",

Learning about how atoms act, then about how these larger molecules act, and how they interact with each other in a system, and how those systems modify each other. Very well organized and very strong explanation of every single topic. I honestly didn't NEED the textbook (though it was VERY helpful to fill in the blanks when I may have spaced out during lecture.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: Sections seemed pretty irrelevant. I did not ever feel compelled to go and even when I did I felt it was a waste of my time ",
            "\u00a0Section sometimes felt like a regurgitation of the lecture, which wasn't bad, but I felt it could have a been a bit more useful. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course I would say is that I thought the exams were graded pretty harshly in terms of direct fact recall. I understand you cannot always give partial credit for \"almost\" answers but I think the exams tended to test rote memorization a little more than conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Course was well taught, and the printing of the lecture slides was extremely nice and helpful. Overall no immediately clear weakness - I don't really support the grading system, which is based on the median rather than the mean, creating a significantly more competitive environment. (e.g. extreme example, but if first quintile is somehow composed of 100's, an exam score of 99 would be an A-) But the strengths of the class outweigh the grading system (after all, the goal is to do well in the class regardless of how it's graded). I enjoyed the material for the most part, I enjoyed the lecturing, section was useful for the most part, and problem sets were appropriately difficult and spaced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the lecturing styles of the instructors which were clear and well-paced. I also appreciated the instructors connecting different topics together whenever possible. Weaknesses include the need to memorize the most obscure information from slides in some of the midterms. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well-organized and very thorough. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The very orderly structure of the course made it run like a machine. Perfect execution on that front. Very transparent exams and very intriguing lectures. \r\n\r\nWeakness:Not much. Pretty air tight course. ",
            "\u00a0Theres a whole lot of material covered in this course, which is necessary because there are so many metabolic processes. That also means that were not spending a lot of time on each process, which makes the class incredibly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0It's a LOT of work and moves very very fast! You need to make sure you keep up! I learned a lot of interesting things, but you will probably need to put in 2x as much work as you initially think. It's well organized though and both profs are clearly amazing. \r\n\r\nAt the end of every lecture, there's a 15 minute supplement. I wish the profs would have made the supplements available after because they were really interesting applications of the sometimes dense material.\r\n\r\nAs for the course itself, Prof Simon takes the first half, which I think is naturally easier, and Prof Koelle does the second, which goes by ridiculously fast. Each half has its unique challenges and you really need to be able to adjust quickly between the halves of the semester.\r\n\r\nAlso, beware: people are really smart in the course. Curve is harsh. ",
            "\u00a0Protein biochemistry is super interesting, but when the course moves into the jumbled pathways and enzymes of metabolism I think it loses everyone. Also, memorizing the entire glycolytic pathway for a quiz worth 5% of your grade is a complete waste of time. At least the workload was very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n(1) VERY well taught. (2) Problem sets were not difficult, but they were still comprehensive and provided a great review of the material. (3) Supplements were always very interesting and relevant. (4) Lectures were always logically-organized and easy to follow. (5) Section always provided useful reviews of what was covered in class. (6) Piazza was a valued resource, especially considering the amazing peer tutor for this course. (7) Division between first and second halves of this course was very well-done.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n(1) Sometimes it felt like memorization was emphasized too much. I agree that memorization is very important for grasping larger concepts in biology, but sometimes it felt excessive and like we had to know literally EVERY detail of every lecture. (2) It would have been nice for difficult concepts like tandem MS and non-equilibrium steps to be given more care (tandem MS could have used more attention, though the blame partly falls on us students for not asking more questions when Professor Simon asked if we had any; non-equilibrium steps were explained pretty well with the pipe analogy, but emphasizing how critical this concept was and really pressing students to understand would have made learning about metabolism later on a bit easier). ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught by Prof. Simon and Koelle. Lectures were great and always fun to attend. One suggestion would be maybe to include more application based or experimentation based content in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think the work should perhaps be spread out a bit more throughout the semester. I also think the midterms are worth too much, and I think it's worth having a true third midterm to lower the amount of content present on each. The second midterm in particular covered a very large amount of content. Strengths were that I did feel like I learned biochemistry at a deep level. I now understand certain things (adrenaline signaling, hunger/starvation) in a way that helps me better understand how my body works. Weaknesses: this class being graded by percentiles can make it difficult to do as well as you want, especially given the intensity of many of those who take it. Overall, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot but think the grading was a bit harsh. ",
            "\u00a0I have very mixed feelings about the supplements at the end of each lecture. I do think it was a little bit of a time-waster to spend 10 minutes each lecture learning about a random topic instead of, for example, learning the process of photosynthesis. I also think that since students were told from the very beginning that the supplements would not be tested, all students were extremely distracted and itching to leave. Perhaps if there was an extra credit question on an exam about one of the supplement topics, it would encourage students to stay and listen more.\r\nOn the other hand, I did think that the supplements brought the material to life. I learned about medicine and technology topics that I had never known before, which was very interesting. I just wish that somehow the supplements were better integrated into the material of the class, rather than small, separate lectures.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I wish was different was the test correction system of this course. I personally never appealed a question, but I did think some of the grading was inconsistent (some friends and I wrote virtually the same thing but got graded differently), and when people appealed for a grade change, rather than trying to help students learn why they were wrong, the grading staff were just adamant about not returning points without explaining why. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized, and the exams were fair. The material was interesting. The supplements were really great, too! I enjoyed those a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes very indepth and throws a lot of fascinating information at you. THe class is weak in that it can be cut throat at times and seem very strict and harsh to do well. THe class is, however, one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken and I feel like such an expert on some topics at the end. The way we can talk and think about metabolism is incredible. I actually understand why some diseases like diabetes are so popular. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Matt Simon is a great lecturer, clear and very engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Later exams were unduly hard and not much support was given re: review sessions and otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the instructors and TA's were strong and explained the material clearly. I thought there could have been more coordination between the two professors, and thought the explain-your-answer questions on the exams really punished students from straying from the precise answer key answer. Though this didn't happen to me, a friend who didn't do well on the first midterm was advised to drop the class rather than be offered support, and I thought this was an inappropriate response on  Prof. Simon's behalf. ",
            "\u00a0This course presents a lot of information, but it is well structured to help students learn. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are very good, Simon & Koelle are a good combo for teaching, content covered is very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were not standardized and had varying degrees of usefulness, exams are graded fairly arbitrarily, doing well in the class requires a LOT of memorization, problems sets are near useless since they are so easy and not representative of exams ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures and I think the material is well selected to cover the most important aspects of biochemistry. However, the grading policies for this class seriously need to be improved. As a start, it would be nice if the whole psets were graded (I really don't think it would take the TAs more than 5min per pset) and if the expectations of the class were clear. You can't tell students not to worry about details and then ask about PTI as a trypsin inhibitor, which you spent barely a second on in lecture. Also, the average on the exams was lower than expected not because the exams are too hard or the students aren't smart enough, but because the grading of the exams is way too harsh, and for no good reason.

I thought that the expected prerequisite knowledge was reasonable, though I would have enjoyed greater connection to what I learned in organic chemistry. I appreciated the problem sets as an easy way to earn a few points, but I don't think I learned very much from doing them. Occasionally, grading on the homework was ambiguous because of vague questions and/or answers, and I rarely received explanations for lost points. I wish that the professors held regular office hours. \r\n\r\nI do not think that a cumulative final is appropriate for this class--the amount of material I had to review for that exam was positively overwhelming, and full comprehension and memory of all concepts taught in the course is probably impossible for most humans. (I say this as someone who scored in the top quintile on both midterms.) I think that having three equally weighted midterms each testing 1/3 of the course material would be a better way of assessing students and would certainly reduce stress and anxiety. That being said, I found the exams to be generally fair and well written, with two exceptions. First, I dislike the emphasis on memorization of facts for the fill-in-the-blank questions--I much prefer your in-depth concept questions such as the serpin question on the final, which was one of the best exam questions I've seen in Yale STEM. Second, I found it somewhat unfair to explicitly test Midterm 1 content on Midterm 2 (e.g., the silk question).\r\n\r\nOverall, this was probably the most challenging STEM course I've taken so far at Yale, and it was also the most rewarding. I really enjoyed the class and its professors. ",

The weaknesses are that my TA was very unhelpful and would frequently provide wrong or unhelpful answers, making section useless, and because homeworks were gimme points, a lot of the grade was based in very dense exams.

Granted, this class will fill your head with a ton of information about proteins in various metabolic pathways and how their functions are carried out and regulated. You will definitely learn a lot.
