            "\u00a0I have known more about electrophysiology and clinical cases related to defective ion transporters. ",
            "\u00a0This course went very in depth into the variety of molecular transport motors and their gating. I also learned about the many ways in which failures of transport systems led to human diseases. I found both the first portion of the course, which focused on the mathematical details of transport, and the second portion of the course, which focused on the larger picture, very interesting. The way that the course was structured was also very nice. "
