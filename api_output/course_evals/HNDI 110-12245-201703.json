            "\u00a0This is a really fun course, and it reminded me that I really love learning languages. Seema ji and Swapna ji are really wonderful and caring, and pay attention to each individual student -- each student is really judged only by their own progress, and not compared to others (in terms of grading/day to day in class and what you get out of the class). Day to day, I didn't really feel like I was learning too much, but definitely did learn a good amount of Hindi gradually throughout the semester and looking back can appreciate that I've learned quite a bit of Hindi. Definitely feel really confident with reading and writing Hindi, and have learned a good amount of vocabulary (though I think we could have gotten a greater amount of vocabulary -- other language classes definitely learn and are quizzed on much more vocab and I think we could handle getting more than we do). \r\n\r\nI wish the course were much more organized and I really wish there was more emphasis on speaking Hindi and conversation -- like if there were Hindi lunches or dinners like there have been in the past (though I know that was logistically challenging this year). The conversation sections with a TA were not too useful -- the TA never prepared at all for these sections, and half the time the sections fell into chaos within minutes. We each maybe would get to say two contrived sentences in Hindi through strange on-the-spot exercises in the whole hour rather than even trying to have a conversation and respond to one another. \r\n\r\nAlso, I think the pace of the class could be a little more even and maybe just generally faster -- specifically I think we could have introduced verb tenses earlier and paced them out rather than spending so much time on just the progressive tense then introducing all the others at once near the end of the semester. Plus the way we did it this year, people got used to using the progressive tense for everything because we used only that tense for almost a month rather than introducing any others. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I have learned the basics of Hindi, which I would not have done on my own. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, if you want to learn Hindi take this class! If you do have any background in Hindi at all you should probably take the Accelerated/Heritage class though -- for me, I took this class because I didn't know how to speak Hindi basically at all coming in, but as someone with the ability to understand basic Hindi conversations and a tiny tiny bit of Hindi knowledge I still found this class a little slow-paced. So definitely if you do know some Hindi you should consider taking the heritage class, but this is a good introduction to Hindi. "
