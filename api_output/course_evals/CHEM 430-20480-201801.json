            "\u00a0Stat mech is a bridge between the very abstract, infinite-dimn'l theory of quantum mechanics, which is generally limited to small systems, and the very practical theory of thermodynamics, which is great but has no basis (traditionally) in molecular theory. Stat mech is all about describing the states of a system in a microscopic way (essentially counting all possible states of the system) and deriving (usually with calculus) macroscopic meaning from that description. You'll learn to do this, as well as get intros to MC and MD simulations. Some of my personal favorite results from the class: a molecular version of the chemical equilibrium constant Keq; derivation of pV=NRT; deriving the behavior of fermions and bosons at low temps and showing they converge to classical particles at high temps.

            "\u00a0Victor's notes are well put together, and there are so so many online resources that cover the same material (highly recommend David Tong's Statistical Physics notes from University of Cambridge as a good foil to Victor's notes). In class, the lectures are just chalk talks, which I enjoyed. He's a great lecturer, funny and engaging. Occasionally Victor would try to do out quite long derivations, and once or twice got muddled up in them. But, he would always come to class the next time with it figured out, and would show us what he had gotten wrong the first time. (Just make him use hyperbolic trig next year and it will be easier). I was pleased with the breadth and depth of the material we covered. "

            "\u00a0A good survey of topics in statistical mechanics. If you are just starting out, it's a good introduction. But you may not gain deep insights or intuition for the material. Quite a lot of ground is covered and the last chapters are rather advanced. There is a lot of emphasis on derivation so be prepared for a lot of arduous algebra. But I recommend it as a first exposure to statistical mechanics. The class itself is not very demanding. Homework is not frequent (we only had about 7 assignments - half the number of psets classes of this kind usually assign) and none of them took more than two hours. (One could argue that more rigorous homework would have been more conducive to deeper understanding but I'm not going to complain.) ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you're looking for a challenge. I'm an MBB major who wanted some more quantitative course work, and got exactly what I was looking for. If you're a math major looking for something applied, this class should also be right up your alley. (If you're physics, go take the physics stat mech course :p ). If you've had multivariable calc, you'll be fine; be prepared for a steep learning curve in terms of derivations if not. Linear algebra makes a few appearances, but he walks you through it. If you haven't had it, watch a Kahn Academy vid on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Quantum will help, but I didn't have any quantum, and just spent the first two weeks of class occasionally skimming early chapters of the canonical quantum text books (Griffiths, Introduction to QM).  Exams are hard but fair; study the derivations. "
