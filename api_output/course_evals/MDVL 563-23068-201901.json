            "\u00a0I gained a tremendous amount of confidence in transcribing documents written in a difficult hand. ",
            "\u00a0Brilliant class on palaeography. Wide-ranging overview of scripts, locations, bindings, inks and many other things. ",
            "\u00a0Much greater skill at recognizing scripts and placing and dating them at sight. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to date and localize medieval scripts improved greatly in this course. My knowledge about codicology in general also increased significantly. Both the readings and our work in class with manuscripts contributed to the learning experience. I also enjoyed learning about medieval bindings and inks from the guest speaker, Karen Junzi. Overall, I now feel much more confident approaching and examining medieval manuscripts. "

            "\u00a0this was an excellent course, a very good balance between transcription practice and teaching about regional manuscript culture ",
            "\u00a0A stunning course. Great breadth and variation of material. Incredible professor. ",
            "\u00a0There wasn't much accountability for doing the readings; integrating them more into the activities for that week would help. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course included its setting at the Beinecke, where we could examine numerous manuscripts every class, Professor Shailor's deep knowledge about the subject matter and her enthusiasm for teaching students, and the very useful secondary texts which were assigned along with transcription exercises. The final project of focusing on a single manuscript and writing a paper about it provided the opportunity to put our newfound knowledge into practice, which is the best form of learning. The course could possibly be improved by devoting a bit more time to the localizing and dating of manuscripts through their decoration rather than just through the scripts they contain. We would only treat decoration in passing and did not do readings about it. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I learned a great deal, the time commitment was not overwhelming, and the final project was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a graduate student who needs to work with manuscripts and reading historical scripts. I would even recommend it to a student who does not specialize in medieval studies or book history just because it is so much fun to work with manuscripts! Every student will take something away from it. "
