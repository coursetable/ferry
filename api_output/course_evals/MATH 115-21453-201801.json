By the end of the course I didn't even watch them and instead just read the textbook, which was much more relevant to the problem sets and exams. I also felt like the practice exams were always easier than the actual exams. For some reason I always seemed to be able to do the practice exams, but then I came into the exams and found them quite difficult (maybe this is just a reflection of my own test anxiety, but I know others felt the same way and it has never been an issue for me before).
