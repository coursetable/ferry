            "\u00a0I gained a new understanding of trans nationalism, diaspora, and the the structures that exist to facilitate these processes. I also learned about a lot of migratory pathways that exist that I was unaware of before. ",
            "\u00a0very interesting topic, good introduction to anthro methods and stuff ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great, in-depth study of migration focusing more on East Asia, which was incredibly unique because it challenges a lot of the misconceptions or simplistic understandings that we may have regarding the reasons why people move and their experiences in the host countries. We explored a lot about the importance of transnational communities, agency, imagined futures and pasts, and the complicated processes that go into creating a concept of home, which was fascinating because we got to learn about different groups of people and their individual experiences. The class also was a stepping stone into anthropology and made me fall in love with the idea of conducting ethnographic fieldwork because the material we covered was so diverse and detailed. ",
            "\u00a0I was not particularly interested in East Asia but this course made me realize how much there is to learn about East Asia & in the context of transnationalism ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT about transnational migration  a topic that I not only previously knew very little about (bad of me as the child of migrants, honestly) and a term that is often conflated with \"immigration\" but requires a more granular analysis. I learned about the ways in which East Asian countries were both recipients and senders of transnational migrants, and the roles that governments, institutions, children, money, etc. play in determining which countries are strong recipients and which countries are strong senders. In today's political climate, having a strong understanding of migration and all the nuances associated with it is absolutely critical, and this course and SLvB's instruction provided that. Also, I learned a lot about anthropological methods since SLvB gave us good exposure of the different types of tools and research methods used in anthropology. As someone who is not an anthropology (or East Asian Studies) major, this was fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we analyzed transnationalism through the lens of migrants in East Asia. We read a variety of readings about the stories of migrants from the Philippines, China, Korea, and more. We also watched a few documentaries about migration and migrants. We also learned about theories behind migration and talked about the ethnographic method. I loved loved loved this course and learned so much from every reading that we did. I appreciated how the readings and examples would all connect together in our assignments and later readings. Everything in this class was very well connected and will give you an amazing foundation to discuss migration in many contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I initially shopped the course without an intent to take it, but Im glad I did. We learned so much about migration (not just transnational and in East Asia) but also the political, economic, and philosophical implications of it. Readings were focused on ethnographic accounts, but we watched films and read articles as well. "

            "\u00a0This was such a strong class, covering a great deal about the subject with nuance and a variety of perspectives. The syllabus is constructed with great care so that the topics flowed into each other. Class structure also allowed for a lot of analysis and discussions. Also Professor LeBaron von Baeyer is such a credit to the class, she really brought it to life and led class discussion seamlessly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great discussion, class not as diverse  \r\nweakness- too much reading every week , long essays ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course definitely have to do with the readings that we did as well as the engaging discussions each time, which were facilitated by Professor LeBaron von Baeyer, since she was able to help us tease apart our understanding of migration in order to develop a more nuanced perspective. The class also only took place once a week for a longer period of time, which was extremely worthwhile because it allowed our discussions of the reading to be more detailed and expansive. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is engaging, and the format of the class so that you submit discussion questions before class is very good ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class structure, relevant readings, good discussion\r\nWeaknesses: heavy workload ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor SLvB really is a gem of the Yale Anthropology Department. She is absolutely incredible at the fine art of balancing leading a discussion and letting the students take control. She also provides excellent feedback, especially during office hours, which is a difficult skill! Another strength is that this seminar is VERY accessible to non-Anthropology or non-East Asian Studies majors, partly because of the nature of the topics (a topic like immigration requires little prior knowledge) but also because SLvB keeps in mind that not everyone has an anthropology background. I also liked the required discussion question/reading response every week because it kept us on track with readings. No-laptop policy also worked surprisingly well (I had my doubts in the beginning when it was implemented). Also, the size of the class (I think 14 students for spring 2018) was perfect: small enough to get to know other students and engage in intimate discussions but large enough so there was a diversity of opinion. SLvB also did a great job of keeping us up-to-date with events related to transnational migration!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more guidance on the papers. I understand SLvB's perspective of wanting to keep it open for students, but I think there's something to be said about a little structure. Of course, when I had this issue, I just went to office hours where SLvB did provide that structure I was seeking, but I wish it was more readily available. I also wish the readings were a little lighter, some weeks were quite dense. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing readings, good discussion, essays that allow you to weave your personal identity and other interests into the topics discussed in class, great professor, seminars are well-structured between powerpoint slides/lecture/discussion, variety of readings and documentaries\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! Enjoyed going to class every week! ",
            "\u00a0The diversity and selection of readings were great, as well as the freedom we were given on the midterm and final papers. Class discussion was always very engaging, and I never felt bored. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor LeBaron voon Baeyer is one of the best professors at Yale and this class is challenging and interesting and amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course even if you are not particularly interested in anthropology because it was really rewarding to grow as a writer and a thinker since the class was so engaging! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course. Super insightful if you're interested in East Asia, migration, diaspora... even if you're not an Anthro major there are so many lenses through which we view and discuss the topics that the course invites a wide variety of academic disciplines to the conversation. Every reading was really engaging and class discussions were well structured and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Professor LeBaron von Baeyer is a GEM of this university ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it expanded the way I think about life and had really thought-provoking content. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! WITHOUT A DOUBT, TAKE THIS CLASS!! This class has seriously changed everything I thought I knew about migration/immigration. Migration is such a complex issue, and viewing it from an anthropological lens is fascinating. Professor SLvB is truly a hidden gem of the Yale Anthropology Department: she is great at facilitating discussion, very knowledgable about migration and Japanese-Brazilian migration in particular, and works well with students. I wish I had discovered her classes earlier in my Yale career. When I think about my entire Yale experience, especially as it's coming to an end, this is one of the few courses that I can say with confidence has shaped my worldview and one of few that I will remember post-graduation. The assigned readings can be a little on the heavy side sometimes, but it's honestly worth staying up doing. There are two assignments (midterm paper and final paper) and both have topics that are incredibly flexible, you can basically write about anything that interests you. The mandatory reading responses/discussion questions were good at not only keeping me on track with reading, but also at practicing succinct writing - a skill that many Yale students, myself included, lack! Summary: great life-changing course, highly recommended, if you're on the edge, JUST TAKE IT!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes!! I've never taken an anthropology class before and this was my favorite class this semester. Everyone comes from a range of different backgrounds and brings a unique perspective to the discussion. This class pushes you think in different ways and will ask you to start thinking about the larger structural forces that influence our world. If you are interested in fascinating stories of imagination, dreams, and resilience, please take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you are any bit interested in Asian studies, migration, or anthropology. Discussions and readings are interesting, and youll learn a lot if you stay engaged! "
