            "\u00a0This class gave me incredible insight into the mind of the South. The syllabus was intentionally crafted to expose students to difficult, rich texts that made lecture and section discussions incredibly rewarding. My critical thinking and close-reading were also greatly improved from this course. ",
            "\u00a0looking at the slave owning period of American history through the eyes of authors who experienced it gave a really honest look at it. ",
            "\u00a0Even being from the south I thought I knew a lot about it, but this class taught me so much more about the region in general. I learned a ton about its identity, relationship with the past, and its greatest writers. You really get an interesting perspective of the south through reading all of its greatest authors and their works. I also learned how to close read even better while putting it into context of broad ideas as well. We also learned a lot about the individual authors and their backstories along with different writing styles. ",
            "\u00a0I did not find the course to be as successful as it could have been. Often the lectures and the literature were disconnected due to lack of structure and clarity. ",
            "\u00a0I built up a rich knowledge of the South's history, culture, literature, and general personality. I gained a lot of insight into why the American South is the way it is and why it is so strange in the way it deals with both internal relations between black and white as well as its external relation to the North and to the country overall. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest thing I'm going to take away from this class is an improved ability to close-read, thanks in large part to hearing Prof. Smith read and analyze passages in lecture. It was almost like getting to inhabit his mind, seeing what he sees and thinking what he thinks. ",
            "\u00a0I see the American South, and the US as a whole, in a completely new light. I also have gained skills about the proper ways to analyze and find connections between disparate literary works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about readings, how to improve my close-reading and argumentative skills within the context of a paper, and how to place themes in a broader context of a place and time. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about the importance of art in the south, through writing, music, and film. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting. Over the course of the semester, I engaged with classic texts - Professor Smith had great selections. My close-reading skills definitely strengthened, and I learned how to analyze literature. I also learned how to space out weekly readings in order to best complete them before lectures/section. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about southern culture through amazing literature ",
            "\u00a0This class is about the Southern Gothic - that deep and disturbing haunting of the South by slavery - and how it impacts literature from the Antebellum to current ",
            "\u00a0The course provided practice in close reading and offered a broad understanding of southern literature ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Southern history, especially with relation to racial issues, and got a great overview of Southern literature. ",
            "\u00a0Better analysis and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of the literature and culture of my home region, the American South, through examining novels, poetry, films, and music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history and themes of Southern literature. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I strengthened my ability to close read and challenged myself in new styles of literary analysis. I also learned to think about literature through the lens of a region and its ethos. I developed a foundational knowledge of Southern American literature, including traditional alternative readings of the classics. ",
            "\u00a0Read about southern literature and discussed related themes and issues. ",
            "\u00a0Very little, honestly. A weak English lecture, buoyed only by interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great discussion of Southern (Gothic) literature.  This class will reframe your understanding of the meaning of various literary elements. ",
            "\u00a0Literature analysis, history of the American south, lots of really interesting theories about race relations in the united states. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I honestly cannot think of a way to improve this course. It would be even more engaging and interesting if it were taught in a seminar, but then again, so would many English lectures. The strengths of this course include engaging material and thoughtful analysis from the professor and the TFs. Studying only the literature from and about a specific region of America led to many insightful discussions in and out of the classroom. Moreover, I found the paper prompts interesting and open-ended. Papers were framed as an opportunity to explore a topic one found especially interesting and were actually fun to write. ",
            "\u00a0weakness, nearly impossible to keep up with all the readings if you do other things like sports or take other classes that have moderate reading lists.\r\nstrength, professor smith is very knowledgeable and a well spoken instructor ",
            "\u00a0Course was very well organized and wonderfully taught ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! The texts were, for the most part, very interesting and Professor Smith always helped us look at the text in a unique way during lecture. My only suggestion would be to replace some of the literature on Indian removal. That section of the class felt very out of place. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was honestly great. The lectures were really interesting, and the sections were also really cool. They incorporated music along with the texts we were reading which was a really cool comparison and relationship that was highlighted in the class. The film screenings were also great additions to the literature. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class as someone from the South (kind of--Texas) with some, but not a lot of academic exposure to Southern lit. I've always been excited about \"Southern literature,\" but know that somewhere behind my excitement is a romanticized mythology of the South that I am certain does not really exist.  This class, even in its title,  \"Love and Hate in the South,\" is clearly trafficking in that kind of mythologized Southern mystique; I'd hoped it would then turn and interrogate that mystique, but I don't think it ever did to the extent that I was hoping for. Even the way that the class handled the discussion of \"difficult material\" (i.e. racist material) was, I thought, performed or dramatized in a way that felt indulgent. ",
            "\u00a0I did not find the course to be as successful as it could have been. Often the lectures and the literature were disconnected due to lack of structure and clarity. The professor presented various opinions on a certain theme but none of them were ever concrete enough to have a grounding in the material. The lecture often only partially addressed some of the readings and didn't regard other. The presentation of the material was also an issue. The professor insisted on using the N-word until students challenged him on his usage. ",
            "\u00a0This course was honestly amazing. It was so exciting to study a collection of material that had been so meaningfully curated. I loved the way that we studied so many different types of texts/medianovels, short stories, songs, narrative non-fiction, essays, poems, legal codes, etc.and yet the themes of these texts all converged around similar pillars of identity in the South and displayed a common Southern consciousness. I'm honestly not sure anything could be improved with this course. There was a very heavy amount of reading, so perhaps the shorter readings could be cut down to smaller passages, but I found all of the readings quite valuable so I'm not sure that would be possible. I also was not sure how necessary it was to have both a final paper and exam, but the exam synthesized the concepts of the class quite well for me so I didn't really mind taking it. ",
            "\u00a0The classes biggest strength was its syllabus -- wonderful readings. The weakness, I would say, was the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The focus could be narrowed a tad. For example, the one or two lectures on Indian removal felt like a forced inclusion, and irrelevant to the rest of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the reading list - I enjoyed most of the texts that we discussed. A weakness is the pace and format of lectures; they could be draggy and slow at many points, and Professor Smith simply talked about the readings and gave his perspective on insignificant points, rather than engaging the readings in a critical and meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing reading materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think because it is a lecture course for some very controversial materials, the viewpoint we were receiving felt a little limited. I think we could have benefited from more open discussion or a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0Cool content, good books (minus huck finn) -- some people didn't vibe with prof smith's teaching style (his choice to use the n word) and also his performativity. I think that affected how positively the class environment was and in dealing with these subjects. TA was great. Overall, glad i took the class cos i have never read american literature before. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to study the writers a little bit more before reading their works. I'm not an AMST or ENGL major and so I didn't know much about the writers of whose works we were reading and would've liked to know a little history about the writers themselves before digging into their novels/works. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong - lectures and readings were always interesting. In terms of weaknesses, I think some of the readings were often overwhelming in terms of quantity. Although always interesting, many of the short stories towards the end of the semester could have been dispersed over a longer period of time. Other than that, the course was really amazing! One of the best I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think the syllabus was solid, but it's a bit difficult to understand what to study for for the final. I would suggest cutting out the final exam and inserting a third paper instead. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe more structure for the papers would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smiths lectures are fantastic, but I felt like he lost energy towards the end. The assignments are pretty standard. Would have preferred more history/social sciences reading, but it is a literature class (though more billed as cultural studies) ",
            "\u00a0The literary analysis was strong, but there could be more historical contextualization. Also, an in-depth discussion of the politics and problematic language should have happened earlier in the course ",
            "\u00a0Maybe more emphasis on modern literature/Southern issues as well ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of reading, and some of the conclusions drawn by Professor Smith seemed like stretches, but overall this course is incredibly interesting for those interested in Southern culture, history, and literature. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is simply fantastic; a lot of enjoyable and insightful readings. That said, sometimes there were simply too many works by one author in a given week (referring particularly to Barry Hannah, Karen Russell, and Flannery O'Connor). My teaching fellow was incredible! Dedicated, open, always willing to lend her knowledge and expertise (and push us to develop our own). I think the expectations for the final exam could be made a little clearer; I stressed out unnecessarily towards the end of the semester trying to determine which passages we might be asked to identify. As it turns out, they were almost exclusively passages we had discussed in lecture or sectionbut I don't think that was clear in how the final exam was discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings, however, I'm not actually sure what the greater goal of the course was, in terms of formulating some philosophy of the South. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the content of this course was organized and presented incredibly well.  I tend to take English lectures as a lesson in making an argument as much as a lesson in the actual subject matter, and in this respect found Love and Hate to be one of the most interesting courses I've taken in the English department.  I admired how the course had a cohesive center of gravity, an overall thesis, around which Professor Smith arranged smaller arguments about each text.  It felt like a book and I hope it becomes one.  Beyond the organization, I thought the lectures were engaging and eloquent.  I did wish we could have read just one or two more full works as opposed to excerpts (like a book of poems, or all of Douglass's Narrative, or all of Johnson's Autobiography, etc.).  The course didn't feel piecemeal because every text had its place, but sometimes I just wanted to read a whole book instead of just a couple of chapters -- I think it would have made for more dynamic discussions in section, at least.  Also, more of a logistical problem, but I wish the second essay was due earlier in the semester as opposed to right at the end, since we have a final exam in the course and the paper is not exactly a term paper (but conflicts deadline-wise with actual term papers).  Perhaps it would be nice to have three deadlines out of which students could pick two. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in its organization and thematic continuity--Professor Smith presented well thought out lectures that knit together different authors and texts. Its format and assignments were well designed for learning and engagement with the material, and section was a great support/opportunity for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Great reading list, although I think there was too much reading. Our study of the gothic also could have been split in a better way I think. ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture was literally just a summary of the first page of that days reading - no joke. Professor Smith spent most of class reading the first page aloud, very slowly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are fantastic, Professor Smith is a great lecturer.  Readings are very good, work load is more than manageable which leads to interesting and engaging discussions in section.  The themes of the course and the works you read tie together very well and give you a real lineage of Southern literature.\r\nWeaknesses: Second half of the class is a bit too heavy on Southern Gothic.  I would have liked to see a few other more modern types of southern literature, and fewer modern white authors in the second half. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is no doubt professor Smith's lecturing. He is such a riveting lecturer and I was always 100% trying to soak up everything he said in lecture. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material and readings are incredibly interesting (despite there being a lot of them), and this is a class you will find yourself calling home about. The material taught and dissected through this course will pervade into your daily life, shaping your perception of America and its history. The workload is reasonable and the sections do their job of elucidating claims made in lecture. If you are interested in history, English, the South in particular, or just want to take an interesting, engaging course, Love and Hate in the South is for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0if they were truly interested, yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Fascinating subject material and incredibly well taught by the very knowledgeable Professor Smith ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Speaking as a STEM person who had never taken a literature class before, it was pretty confusing at first what exactly I was supposed to be learning from this class. But I came to really appreciate having homework which was just reading interesting books and short stories that I had always wanted to read but never felt I had the time for. I think anyone who is interested in learning more about the South should take this class because it's not that much work, but exposes you to so much good literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The south is such an interesting place, and this class really showcases how unique it is through such a cool angle of literature. Whether you're from the south and want to learn more about your home or from somewhere else it's a great class to take. The reading is extremely interesting, the teaching is great, and the lectures are incredibly interesting. I loved going to this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to other students. There are better courses that address Southern Literature and this was not one of them. I found the approach disjointed and inconsistent. We often muddled the lines of literature, legal scholarship, history, and philosophy without executing any of them particularly well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A strangely disproportionate number of students in our class grew up in the South, but I really think that more students who are from other regions should take this course. People often make negative generalizations about the South without really delving into the region's psyche and how it has become the way it is. Learning about this was very interesting and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Southern literature or want to learn more about it at all, then it is a great course! There is not much writing involved and the readings are very interesting. Professor Smith also guided us through readings of many influential pieces and provided different perspectives which was awesome. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class, unless you are very interested in southern literature. Lectures seem aimless and can be frustrating. Section is worse. There is no real discussion, just a recitation of the lectures at an even slower pace. A lot of \"close readings\" and very little conversation about the text. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was either my favorite or second-favorite class this semester. The material we covered was extremely interesting, and still relevant today. It improved me as an English student and as an American conscious of his nation's ghostly history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. Two essays and a final exam is a very manageable workload for those looking for an extra credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn more about social dynamics in the south. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Every student should take a course on American Literature, and Professor Smith is a very engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if its offered again, I think its a fabulous course which gives you the opportunity to read all the southern literature you never read + Huckleberry Finn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a wonderful class and a great way to learn about the literature that shaped the south. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre interested in the South, especially if youre from the South ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone with a personal attachment to the South, or to anyone who seeks to dive into southern literature ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a lot of fun! Sometimes the readings are a lot but many are not necessary to read in depth. Professor Smith is an amazing lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the history of the American South. If you're not, this class could be dull. The readings are mostly engaging and Professor Smith is a great lecturer. The midterm paper was only 4-6 pages and the final paper was 6-8, and the final was designed to be fair. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course if you're interested in the material. Lectures are stimulating and readings cover a wide range. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you're not from the South (or even from the US), take it: you'll gain valuable insight into a region with which you may be unfamiliar. If you are from the South, you should still take it: your particularly corner of the South will likely be coveredincluding Florida, New Orleans, the Delmarva, the Bible Belt, etcand you'll enjoy the chance to think critically about your home. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The readings were a lot of fun and often deeply affecting, and the lectures were dynamic and rich without feeling like an overwhelming amount of information.  As mentioned earlier, this course is a great lesson in how to make a strong argument as well as an interesting perspective on Southern literature.  I know some students in the class took issue with Professor Smith, but at the very least he made himself open to criticism and handled it in a respectful way. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the South or its literature, you won't regret taking this course! It's a gripping, thought-provoking journey, and you'll read some incredible literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great professor and readings. There are some heavy themes though. ",

Professor Smith is a really great lecturer whose lectures always have profound theses even when you are expecting the gist of them.  His lectures connect the themes of love and hate to deep undercurrents and open themes running through the book.  In a sense, this class is a long question about how to define The South, which in itself is a very loaded question.  Professor Smith's syllabus approaches this question with an understanding and respect for the viewpoints about history, race, and gender.  The books on the syllabus are books that you should read, but they are books you should read with the lens of this class. ",
