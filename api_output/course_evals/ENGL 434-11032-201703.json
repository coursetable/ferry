            "\u00a0This course is a great foray into Chaucer beyond what you get in ENGL125 and Minnis is an amazing scholar of Chaucer with excellent insight into the text. The course doesn't really seem connected by \"discourses of dissent' but rather focuses around Chaucer as a storyteller and how it pertains to society as a whole, but it is interesting nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0A greater focus on \"Discourses of Dissent\"have been interesting ",
            "\u00a0Our readings and class discussions were wonderful. I really enjoyed the poems Professor Minnis selected, and our seminars really helped my understanding of whatever theme we were looking at for the day. Prof. Minnis did a great job guiding discussions. Nothing I would have changed. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I know that this is not the most fashionable of senior seminars, but taking this class is the move. I personally love Chaucer and can now read him with as much comfort and enjoyment as anything else, and I'd hope that anyone who takes this class would end up this way as well. Not very convincing, I know. However, here is the money shot: a typical homework assignment--for the whole week!--goes like \"Read the Wife of Bath's Tale for next class.\" ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you really want to dive into Chaucer. The work load is extremely manageable and Chaucer can be accessed in so many ways. Minnis is a brilliant professor who will help you engage with the text in so many unexpected ways and surprise you constantly with his depth of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student, even someone who doesn't think they like Chaucer. "
