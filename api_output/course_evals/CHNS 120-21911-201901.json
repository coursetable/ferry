However, I still have trouble speaking in spontaneous situations. So, I think adding more speaking exercises that aren't rehearsed would benefit me. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we used old characters more. We learn so many characters, and sometimes use one only once, so it's extremely easy to forget it. ",
