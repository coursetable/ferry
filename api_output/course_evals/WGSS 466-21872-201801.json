            "\u00a0During Psychology of Gender Images, I learned how to think critically about media and other sources of gender stereotypes. This class taught me so much about the role that media (and even media users) plays in reproducing and creating stereotypes and tropes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze images and understand gender stereotypes within them. This class taught me how to interpret advertising, media, and many other aspects of our society that are present in so many ways. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting material ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to delve deeper into scientific papers, as well as conduct research in a more meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a formal content analysis of media images while also gaining a new understanding of the prevalence of gender stereotypes in media. I feel that I have a much better understanding of research methods now, especially with regards to social psychology. I have also found myself noticing the themes of the class in the media that I encounter all throughout my daily life now. Once you are aware of the trends, they're impossible to miss! "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Though the class was small, Andrea did a wonderful job of intermixing group discussions, lecture style teaching, and media analysis. The homework assignments were interesting to read and the course was incredibly well organized. Andrea led the class well -- she knew when to direct the discussion and when to encourage specific individuals to contribute. \r\nWeaknesses: At certain times, our class discussions could get a little quiet or certain people would be talking more than others. Though this was never a huge problem, members of our class may have benefitted from seeing discussion prompts a little in advance. With a little preparation, quieter students in a class might feel more welcome to speak out. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar was small and I felt comfortable participating. I thought each class was very interesting. I do not have any significant methods of improvement other then putting it as a morning class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly well organized and easy to follow. The content built on itself such that we were able to have increasingly complex discussions as the semester proceeded. The course also included a great range of possibilities for students to introduce questions about the media that interests them. In particular, the final paper was an amazing opportunity for students to incorporate the new methodologies learned in the class to investigate a question that interested them. ",
            "\u00a0More conversational aspects, it felt too much like a lecture at times despite being a seminar. I would have also liked to have referenced the readings more often or tie them into the class more because they tended not to be addressed. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting class that covers a broad spectrum of material without compromising any topic. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Though this class was a senior seminar for students in the psychology and women & gender studies major, I feel that this is a class that every Yale student should take. For a generation whose lives are so intertwined with media use and creation, it is important to recognize the impact that images have on social structure. This class built my awareness in so many ways; I hope to both share my new perspective with others and act in ways that reflect it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was engaged with the material, felt like Andrea was interested in the work I was submitting and gave great advice not only to help understand the material but in my writing skills as well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! For those interested in the material (and even those who aren't, should be), this is an amazing seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! I really enjoyed this class. The readings, conversations, and projects were all extremely interesting and extremely relevant. I am sure that I will be drawing on the material I learned in this class long after the end of the course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a super interesting class with a very manageable amount of work. Professor Vial is very engaging and knowledgeable. I found myself talking about what we learned all the time! "
