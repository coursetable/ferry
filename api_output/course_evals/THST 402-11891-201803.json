            "\u00a0This course pushed if not eliminated my boundaries as a writer. Pieces I'd previously been afraid of thinking about or performing soon became plausible if not simplistic seeming projects. ",
            "\u00a0explored new radical/political modes of writing and discourse! very exciting! ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great crash-course in different lenses to think about performance (repertoire / archive, minimalism, the body in the text, etc.) that I found myself using in other classes / my life generally almost immediately. Other insights include the relationship between art and criticism, and ways of imagining criticism-as-art/art-as-criticism. I was also introduced to ways of approaching and appreciating dance and movement, which I had no background in. This class made formerly-inscrutable minimalist and avant-garde dance and theater approachable and delightful. We developed workshopping skills around performance, including thinking about the setting and physicality of a performance. Probably most importantly, there was a de-emphasis on perfection in creating our work. ",
            "\u00a0Techniques of experimental writing and embodied practice. Techniques for joining embodied practices with scholarly practices. Critical skills in evaluating performances and texts about performance. ",
            "\u00a0Self-awareness and a lot of knowledge about dance theory. "

            "\u00a0This course was a phenomenal opportunity to develop a personal vocabulary of writing-based performance. The artists we discussed were inspiring, the class field trips were always awesome, and guest speakers I honestly felt were generally earth-shaking. The class had a great vibe - you get very friendly with your classmates when you're all sitting on the floor every week and playing movement games. Only the discussions of the readings were sometimes lackluster.\r\nI was thankful particularly for the practice at doing automatic writing. It really loosened me up as a writer and allowed me to trust my instincts. ",
            "\u00a0very few weaknesses that I can think of! readings were absolutely excellent and writing the reading response proved an interesting and thought-provoking exercise each week. ",
            "\u00a0I overall loved the way this course was structured and I feel like I got something out of everything we did. The syllabus was very strong and pretty much all of the texts were well chosen. I never felt like my time was being wasted. The performances we attended tied in very well and always gave me a lot to think about (and were fun!) This class made me think about movement in performance in a whole new way and even though our movement exercises felt odd at first I ended up really appreciating them and getting a lot out of them. It was such a wonderful change of pace from my typical coursework and I really appreciated it. I kind of wish there were more small-scale creative assignments responding to the reading to be worked on out of class - I really liked the assignments we did in class, especially the \"Imagined Theaters\" one, but wouldn't have minded a little more time to think about it. I ended up feeling a lot of pressure for the midterm and final performances and consequently put them off more than I should (this is a lot on me), but smaller creative assignments throughout the semester might have helped pace that work out a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0In general, with classes where we are sharing work with each other, I often wish we were given more of a framework for critique where we are guided in how to provide constructive criticism, including pointing out things that didn't really work for us/ didn't get communicated in performance. While I appreciated that the class was an incredibly supportive space, I would have liked to hear from my classmates moments that they thought didn't really work  instead of just what they appreciated. I think it would also be nice if the course incorporated a week or so where students all had to speak to Elise and Emily about their work in between the midterm project and the final project. \r\n\r\nI loved how open-ended the midterm and final project prompts were, because it gave us the space to create projects that simply really mattered to us and were things we really wanted to pursue without being constrained by a prompt. The work that came out of that was also incredibly varied and I loved that we were able to watch and share in the work of our classmates. ",
            "\u00a0While the scholarly readings do feel like they are important to the concepts floating around and over the class, I feel that the nature of some of those readings may have created a tension in the course between practice-based explorations and more regular scholarly study. That said, it does feel that this is the same tension that this class hopes to probe, and in that sense it is successful. But I often felt confused about how to approach class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Loved how each week felt totally different but tapped into a different artistic method/way of engagement with text. "

            "\u00a0Take this class if you're interested in performance art or in taking your writing off of the page! You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I'd never taken an experimental course before, but I definitely recommend it with anyone looking to challenge themselves as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0if you're interested in beginning or advancing your corpus of creative work, take this class! you'll be asked to think outside the box, and you'll be encouraged to get personal in your writing. it's absolutely brilliant! (honestly, the field trips/outside performances alone are worth it - Elise and Emily curated an excellent syllabus this past semester.) ",
            "\u00a0Think of it as a 'good life' course for artsy types with a meticulously chosen syllabus (that delivers probably the highest quality-to-time spent-reading-ratio of any class I've ever taken) and an overall positive vibe in which you can try whatever weird performance piece you can dream up. Prof. Morrison and Prof. Coates are both supportive and detailed in their feedback.  The classes vary from typical seminar-style academic discussions to movement exercises to workshops with awesome people. No matter your background, if you want a chance to think about performance and writing differently and get pushed out of your comfort zone, take this! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If the topic of experimental writing and performance appeals to you, I definitely recommend it. I do think that in this course, especially in how the final projects were organised, it did feel like the performance aspect took precedence over the writing aspect and I would have appreciated if there was more emphasis on developing writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I believe the course provides an interesting space for exploring performance and writing that may not have a space otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class is so much fun and helps you develop as an actor and as a person. It makes you more aware of your body and the world, and how to think about text and movement in relation to the confines of your own skin. A great 5th class! "
