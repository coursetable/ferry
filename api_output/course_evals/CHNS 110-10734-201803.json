            "\u00a0Great class!! I am blown away by how much Chinese we learned in a semester. I, along with most people in the class, entered the course knowing no Chinese and am now able to have basic conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to converse in Chinese in a confident and skillful way through only a semester of learning. I felt through focus on my tones, vocabulary, and grammar that I developed a solid foundation of the language and left with a grasp of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read write speak basic Chinese in an incredibly short amount of time! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of introductory chinese in such a short period of time! ",
            "\u00a0I was able to speak, read and write in Chinese and I am extremely proud of the progress I have made in only a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to read, write, interpret and speak Chinese characters and words. I learned how to engage with an incredibly rigorous curriculum of foreign-language learning, and I learned to appreciate the work that goes into learning a language! ",
            "\u00a0Completed Integrated Chinese Level 1 Part 1: Learned 100s of Vocab Words and Characters, Learned basic sentence structures, proper pinyin pronunciation, and limited colloquial terms. Its really amazing how much you learn in only 3 months. "

        [
            "\u00a0Very difficult course with lengthly nightly homework and daily quizzes. Although it is hard, the daily class meetings and extensive homework and preparation necessary are needed to learn a language! ",
            "\u00a0I struggled with learning and speaking the proper tones, but--with the oral presentations and tutoring every week--I have been working on improving it. I felt confident in my grasp of vocabulary and grammar--and ability to ask and answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of work but really helpful as chinese is very foreign relative to english ",
            "\u00a0All around great! ",
            "\u00a0I got much better at writing and speaking Chinese ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class is structured well with very helpful homework assignments and supplementary material\r\nWeakness: class moves too quickly and many grammar lessons or intricacies of vocabulary can be neglected due to the course's pace ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were how the intensive nature balanced writing and speaking, never one over the other. I thought a weakness was that there was little drilling of writing characters in class, which was something I struggled with; rather, there was more so a focus on identifying characters. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n--Engaging\r\n--Excellent Professor\r\n--Daily quizzes forced you to constantly prepare and not fall behind\r\n--Grammer and Vocabulary was taught clearly\r\n--Lots of classroom speaking time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n--Lots of Homework and Studying (also a strength!) "
