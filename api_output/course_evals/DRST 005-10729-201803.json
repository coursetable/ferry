            "\u00a0My writing improved, as did my ability to read and synthesize a great deal of text. The chronological structure of the course also enabled me to learn and think about changes in thinking over time, and the relevance of topics and ways of thinking to present day were often clearly relevant. ",
            "\u00a0How to absorb a lot of reading, annotating historical texts, essay writing ",
            "\u00a0I developed an acute interest in political theory and learned to love difficult reading for the sake of personal gain. ",
            "\u00a0How to be a better writer and how to analyze texts. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the works we read, and I especially enjoyed the discussions about different attitudes toward and methods of writing history. Approach is largely comparative, which is fun. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my critical reading and writing skills, seminar skills, and learned about the ideas of ancient thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills definitely improved throughout the course, and I got much better at reading with a purpose and distinguishing the important details of a text. I also learned a lot about people through how they have expressed themselves politically throughout history, as well as how the ancients have shaped our perceptions of a political life. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a solid understanding of how history and politics intersect in the context of Greek historians, Roman hostorians, and Middle Age Religious thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is like a mini-survey of political philosophy and theory from the ancient Greeks to Aquinas. You'll delve into various authors and their answers to questions like - what is the best way to live? Who should rule? What are laws, and how do humans interact with them? I'm still not sure what the answer to these questions are; it would take anyone more than their whole lifetime to find out. I do feel a little bit more enlightened after taking this course, though. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of critical reading and close attention to passages. Professor Fine will ask for students to submit a critical question once a week to help start discussion in class and to motivate curiosity in the readings; I was really surprised by what kind of connections and questions my classmates were able to come up with. ",
            "\u00a0The most significant improvements I gained from this course was an improvement in my writing skills and my ability to compare and contrast larger themes throughout various texts. My first essay used ambiguous language and really made the reader guess as to what I was arguing; I was scared to flat out state my ideas. However, Jonathan really helped my shorten my writing and make it more meaningful. I also improved my approach to academic discussion. Rather than leading the class, I learned the value of listening. This helped my to recognize themes throughout the texts we read that I otherwise would have missed. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I developed my writing skills and learned about different political regimes. I also found it interesting to see how different authors view history and how that compares to my own views on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to critically examine histories and political philosophy texts in order to discover both the meaning of the written word and uncover the motivation behind its writing; the distinction (and the importance of this distinction) between objectivity and subjectivity when writing and reading histories; examination of various political regimes and the fragile balance between the few and the many.

            "\u00a0The primary difficulty with this class was due to the nature of DS  we simply had too little time to sufficiently cover all the rich and interesting things we read. However, I think that one of the strengths of the course was the way in which our limited time was maximized. There was depth to each discussion, even if more time to discuss would have been ideal, so the breadth of material was addressed well. The progression in ways of thinking and constant connections being drawn between different writers was another great strength of the class, as it enhanced each text and gave me an idea of a larger history of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes there was a lot of reading that was never discussed- could be condensed (for instance, Herodotus and Livy). However, a good survey of thinkers ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more history in H&P, since not all of the students have a rich historical background in ancient history. ",
            "\u00a0Section sucked because everyone was always tired. ",
            "\u00a0\"Historical and political thought\" is a weird combination. I felt that overall, H&P was the least cohesive of the three DS seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: connections with other DS courses.\r\nWeaknesses: unlike other DS courses, H/P seemed divided between the historians and the philosophers, who rarely engaged directly with each other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The assigned reading was very manageable and each of the texts on the syllabus wholly deserve their place on the DS H&P fall syllabus. I would recommend keeping the Agricola at all costs since that was the best reading I read all semester in DS. Some things to think about: can we include Polybius on the syllabus and not take away Plutarch? Perhaps cut some of the Augustine readings would be my suggestion. Also, can you talk  about the Middle Ages without Charlemagne? How can you include Einard on the syllabus? \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - None, honestly. ",
            "\u00a0Unlike the other DS courses, this one's texts felt a little more dissimilar - not that it's completely a bad thing. The readings take you through many, many different formats; we read actual histories - some looser, some strictly year-by-year - and philosophical dialogues and religious works and even one very touching funeral ode-ish work. You learn some type of politics from all of them, even if you wouldn't expect it at first.\r\n\r\nSome readings are definitely a drag to get through. City of God, for example, had about 5 assigned chapters on why astrology doesn't exist, and subsequently, why twins born at the same time will have different fates (don't ask me, take the class yourself). I feel the curriculum could use a once-over to smooth out little wrinkles like this one. Other than that, the texts were all very interesting and fun to discuss in class. I especially enjoyed Tacitus' Annals. He doesn't shy away from giving you the low-down on the ugly side of the Roman Empire. The episodes concerning Nero and his mother Agrippina were really entertaining, almost like an ancient TV drama. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that our focus for each class was extremely clear and therefore discussion was always meaningful because my peers and I were so well prepared. I really appreciated that Jonathan sent out discussion and passage focuses for each class. Also, submitting a concise question each week further helped me to shorten my writing and choose a focus for the text. The weakness of this course is that sometimes I think we neglected to talk about the text as a whole. Though it is difficult to cover all of the material we read due to lack of time, I would have liked to see more focus on the content of the works themselves before diving into the larger questions of \"what is freedom?\" or \"what is justice?\" ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is the seminar style. It not only allowed for a close community in the class, but meant that I felt like I was really invested in the material. A weakness is the pace at which we move through the material because often we only scratch the surface, but in a survey course that is alright. Also the 9:00 AM on Old Campus is brutal because people are waking up for the beginning of class. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was fantastic, but perhaps a little rushed due to the volume of material covered. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course (granted, it's a part of a unit of DS courses, all of which I would recommend). Before classes started, I did expect the course to be more of a history class, but its actual focus (on historical and political thinking, not the events themselves) was ultimately very interesting and fulfilling. The amount of writing and reading were substantial but never overwhelming, and the work always felt engaging and constructive (contributed to writing/reading skills). ",
            "\u00a0Yes- the readings are interesting, and it complements the other two DS classes very well ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would absolutely.  DS was fantastic and H&P is one of its greatest strengths. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. The class was SO boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, DS has its flaws but it's a wonderful learning experience--and you might just discover a new viewpoint that sticks with you or a philosophy that speaks to you in the readings in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. DS is a good program, and you have to take this course to be in DS. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The content is fascinating and you learn so much about the foundations of our society in such a short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course - if you're taking it with Professor Fine, even more so. It'll teach you a lot about life and politics from Ancient Greece onward; the foundation it builds is very useful for contextualizing any further PoliSci or History classes you take. Jonathan is an amazing teacher with a great personality for the seminar; if I didn't have him at 9 am, he would've been hilarious and not just funny. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Jonathan was a great teacher and though I would have liked to look at more of the details of the texts we read, the larger themes were extremely interesting. The class material is also timeless since questions of government and morality can always be tied back to our current political climate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100% if the material is something they are interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to any student with any interest in political thought, as it provides examination of the works and events that led to the modern Western conception of politics and what built the world we live in; it also shows how people have thought of these events and what contemporaries of them believed the implications could be.
