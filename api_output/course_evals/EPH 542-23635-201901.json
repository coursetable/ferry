            "\u00a0great way to get involved in a project that helps the New Haven community, but first have to get through all the theory classes first. Finding a way to make the theory more engaging whether with real life examples or direct application to group project could help improve the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting and hands-on practicum projects, professor and TA are highly dedicated to the course and make themselves very available\r\nWeaknesses: workload is very heavy between weekly classes, homework assignments, as well as outside work for the practicum project, meeting with preceptor/client organization, etc., content covered in many class sessions as well as the textbook are not highly relevant to the projects and tend to be a bit too elementary given most students' experience level. The course would be more effective if the class portion only met a few times (kickoff, midterm checkin, closing, etc) and most of the time and resources are provided to students to work on their projects as they see fit ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this was a well organized course. Dr. Humphries and the TFs were incredible to work with through this process, and I felt that the organizations that they had selected for us to partner with were incredible assets to the community/it was a joy working with them. Overall, the strengths of the course are its 1) structured connections with community stakeholders and 2) the quality of projects that were selected. I felt that the \"asks\" and expectations of the PBCH class and community stakeholders were reasonable, but felt that more structure should be provided to students to meet with faculty or staff at Yale with analytic skills related to their projects. For example, while we were paired with a faculty advisor who had extensive experience in the area we were investigating, she only met with us once over the semester. A scheduled meeting with YCAS, etc. would have been a nice touch, but we did have meeting with Danya Keene (Qual), Kate Nyhan (YSPH Librarian), and others relevant to our methodology that were within the class period. The weaknesses of this class were the readings. I gained very little from our discussions/reading related to systems thinking and would have appreciated using this time in work sessions. The extended work session days were highly productive and effective and should be retaining in future iterations of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-intentioned course. Your experience is highly dependent on your practicum project. Some were better than others from what I could tell in terms of project scope, expectations, and preceptor. I enjoyed my project, preceptor, and teammates. I learned a number of practical skills, which was the reason I took the course in the first place, including project development, project management, how to submit an IRB application, how to write a field action report, and professional etiquette, among others. With that said, this course needs some work before it can reach its full potential. The first 6 or so weeks of the course was based in learning theory and class material. It was frustrating not being given much time to start our projects especially given that 3 months is an extremely short amount of time to execute a practicum project. I really didn't like the book. It was essentially one big metaphor, and I didn't feel it added anything to my experience in the course. We didn't have enough working sessions, and some of the class assignments felt like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0More time to work on assignments in class\r\nMore tangible examples rather than theory ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was so bad ",
            "\u00a0The reading assignments for this course were frankly not a good use of time. If reading the book is necessary for understanding, then providing outlines or summaries of the reading would have been better. I would have much preferred more time to work on the practicum during class with my other group members then spend time on the assignments that could have been a 10-15 minute discussion (not the majority or entirety of class time). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot-how to work in groups, consulting, the intricacies of professional relationships-it wasn't maybe what I wanted to learn or intended to but I learned a lot. It was fulfilling to see a project come full circle and am thankful I had a great group to go through it with ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: working on the practicum project allowed for a lot of real world learning experience (encountering unplanned challenges) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much work at times with the theoretical + practicum experience work. I felt that while the theoretical stuff was important, there could have been a lot less of it and the same points/concepts would have been conveyed. ",
            "\u00a0The class has provided me with qualitative skills I didn't have before such as transcribing and coding interviews. The structure of the course teaches students to be better team members because it requires effective communication to ensure completion of deliverables. ",
            "\u00a0This class is too much for one semester but this is not news to anyone. I think really filtering preceptors before signing them up to work with us for a semester would be very helpful. Also having fewer lessons and more work time during the beginning of the semester would be great to get started on things earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Ideally, this course would be a full-year course offered every other year. We could get through the pedagogical stuff in the fall semester, as well as meet our preceptors and orient to the project and objectives, and then take the spring semester to actually conduct the research. Having a year in between would give preceptors time to implement recommendations from previous years and develop proposals that reflect those experiences/challenges/improvements. Of course, this makes finding TFs more difficult, but given the long legacy of the course already, it may be a worthwhile challenge given the potential benefits in other areas. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be changed to either a 1.5 credit course or have a pre-work period in the fall. Even if it was to begin the literature review, contact your group, and begin to schedule a meeting with the preceptor, it would allow the class to be more beneficial. The projects are condensed to being conducted in a month due to the amount of pre-work needed for the project. The due dates and time frame made it difficult to feel successful. For example, the program theory, methods justification, and different early assignments could be released earlier than Wednesday night (if going to be due Friday at 5:00pm). It would be more real-work if there was a video or more of a framework to use for these assignments and they were opened that Monday to be due Friday; by only having 48 hours to complete it, the class felt a bit rushed and stress-inducing. This is an easy adjustment that will make the students feel more comfortable. A weakness of the course is the dependence on preceptors for project success. However, this is something that cannot be easily avoided. The course gave me a lot of tangible, real-work skill that I am thankful to have, but at a high emotional and time-intensive cost. Much of the stress and emotional burden of the class can be avoided through changing release times/deadlines, intervening with preceptors, and decreasing the amount of theory textbook work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an immense undertaking with very little guidance. You learn as you go, as is the nature of this type of work. The strengths of this class are that you do a lot in a very short amount of Time, but that is also the biggest weakness of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed my project and working with my preceptor. The class component of the course could be improved on by summarizing book chapters-- a lot of the time spent in class is redundant with the reading, and we are so pressed for time, I would have much rather just spent that time working with my team on the project than going around the room talking about specific aspects of a reading that I had already done. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The concept of the course\r\nWeaknesses: the book we read is a bit difficult to understandits overly metaphoricaland tbh, offensive in parts (I.e. Chinese Whispers aka Telephone, thats just racist). The course should encourage engagement earlier rather than later ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of work, but it was worth it! I valued immensely the opportunity to carry out a community-based project from start to finish, and the satisfaction that came with completing the project far outweighed (the few) negatives of the class. Overall, I learned a great deal about community research, research methods (the skillset you'll develop will depend on your project), and effective team work. At the start of the course I constantly felt frazzled, disorganized, unprepared, etc., and I know many of my peers did as well. I think this feeling could be mitigated by having groups be in communication with their preceptors late in the fall semester or over winter break. Similarly, it may be helpful to have groups start their literature review over winter break. Another slight negative was that the theory part of the course felt mismatched with the practical side, such that it was a bit stressful to spend half the class talking theory and then transition into group work. However I understand the importance of discussing theory in a community-based research course and I appreciated that we had the chance to apply the book readings to our projects. I though the TFs were so well-utilized, and our group's TF provided helpful and timely feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Great if you get a project you are interested in. However the content studied in class can be more geared towards community health instead of teaching us how to write reflections. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great in that it provides students with the opportunity to put all of the knowledge and skills they've acquired during their time at YSPH into practice and assist local organizations in accomplishing a task. However, each student's experience will undoubtedly differ depending on their student group's dynamics, their relationship with their preceptor, and the deliverables they are responsible for. "

            "\u00a0Very approachable and kind. Could be a bit more concise and clear about objectives sometimes. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent instructor that truly cares to see her students/their projects succeed. She made herself quite accessible, but took a backseat role, allowing us to pursue our project with limited oversight unless we specifically asked for it. ",

I feel more time should be used to work on tasks for the actual project during class so that students can take advantage of Debbie/the TFs during class time when it comes to the projects. ",
            "\u00a0Debbie is a great and supportive professor ",
            "\u00a0Debbie is a good professor. She is really passionate about the topic and truly cares about her students. Her effort to make the class more of a community was truly felt through her home-cooked meals and lengthened class periods. Debbie wants her students to succeed and have good projects. I think that her teaching and the course are intertwined; by improving the course's structure, it will improve her teaching and vice-versa. For example, by decreasing textbook class time and increasing in-class work time, it will allow students to feel more successful in the course. When teaching from the book, I think it would be best to make it more application based. By having a strictly theoretical book, it made it difficult to understand the application at points. If we drove conversations about the book from a place of our projects or a sample project, that may be better. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: very enthusiastic about the subject and very knowledgeable\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes was a bit unclear in the lectures, also could have included more cases studies ",
            "\u00a0Debbie is a knowledgable and engaging instructor. She understands community research at all levels -- from the theory and 10000 foot view to the minute details of how to recruit participants -- and communicates this so effectively to the class. My only suggestion for Debbie is to perhaps be more transparent about the course structure, which I think could clear up students' confusion/frustration. For example, I think students could benefit from clarity about the textbook and about the assignment timelines. ",
            "\u00a0Very helpful and hears her students ",
            "\u00a0Debbie clearly has a wealth of knowledge in community health research and expertise in navigating the relationships between academics and community organizations. I appreciated her insight in all of these matters. However, I would have liked to have seen more community organization leaders and representatives invited to a few more of our classes to share their insight and perspectives on these partnerships. Additionally, I think that the weekly reading assignments need to be improved upon to make it clear as to why the readings are relevant to student projects. Using case studies to reinforce the topics raised in the readings may be a solution. "

            "\u00a0Overall worth it, but it would've been nice to get more classroom content instead of being thrown out into the project. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend. This course provides you with a practicum opportunity to work closely with community organizations and stakeholders on a public health topic. These community organization contact Dr. Humphries and members of this course to leverage the skillsets of public health students to help them address a relevant, real-time public health project in their communities. In this way, this class goes beyond the classroom and into the community. I felt it was an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0I do not know that I would recommend this course in its current state. If you want to work with an organization in the community and have time to devote to a project, you will gain useful skills. There are drawbacks to the course as I've previously discussed, but my hope is that it will keep improving over the years. In theory, it's a great course but the execution falls a little flat. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. While at times the heavy emphasis in the theoretical was frustrating it was important to get that kind of background. I thought the class provided a really solid learning experience with a community organization in the New Haven area. There were also a variety of projects to choose from when deciding to take the class so quantitative or qualitative skills (or both) could be strengthened depending on what the student is looking for. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, you are basically acting as an unpaid student consultant to organizations around New Haven. It's a lot of work throughout the entire semester with not very much breathing room. I was lucky enough to have a very hard working team and a communicative preceptor. If you had asked me at anytime during the semester, I would not have recommended this course to anyone. However, toward the end I was really proud of how much I learned and how many quality materials I produced during the semester. I would recommend this course to someone who wants to get to know the community better and has little to no experience in qualitative/quantitative work. ",
            "\u00a0As it currently operates, if there's something else you're more interested in studying, go for it. If you really really want to work with a particular organization that's involved... maybe? I don't think I had the greatest learning experience in the class, although I did enjoy being in the class. ",
            "\u00a0In order to take this course, one has to be ready to invest 10-15 hours per week in it. This class is a great deal to undertake. Because it is working with a community organization, the efficiency and productiveness of the project is highly dependent on the preceptor. As well, there is a lot of external reading outside of the project from a textbook that is mostly theory-based. While it is a great course and a fantastic experience to work with a community organization, I would warn students to think hard about the time and emotional commitment. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extremely challenging course that will force you to learn how to work effectively in a team. By the end of this course, you will learn your strengths and weaknesses well. You will also learn if working in a community non-profit or not-for-profit setting is for you. The work load of this course is immense, and trying at times. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to gain practical research skills in a community setting, take this class! For transparency: your experience will be largely based on your project, preceptor, and teammates. I happened to have an excellent preceptor and team and ended up having an incredibly rich and insightful experience. However, this is not to say there weren't struggles and frustrations along the way! You'll put *many* hours (and maybe tears) into the course, but the reward is a final research project you'll (hopefully) be proud of. ",

Additionally, I would recommend the class to any students looking to practice the skills they've gained at YSPH or learn new skills by selecting to work on a project outside of their comfort zone. "
