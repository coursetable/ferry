            "\u00a0The composition seminar sequence does an excellent job of allowing students who write music from a variety of artistic backgrounds and experiences to pursue their interests at their own pace while expanding their abilities through the portfolio assignments. I think the YSM guest lecture portion of the course does the least in support of this environment, both because it is presented in a format that offers limited or inconsistent opportunities for engagement between students and guest artists/music, and because the series is often an insular representation of what \"new music\" can be, and of who makes it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main thrust of the course is very strong; the course asks for a steady stream of composition and the weekly lessons are both a great motivator to actually write things and provide a lot of time to discuss and revise work. I thought that this semester was particularly strong since the visual scoring portfolio exercises were quite substantial compositional projects and were very different from anything else I've done (but drew on prior experience with composition). Moreover, I thought the visual scoring was particularly nice as a project, since it was decidedly using modern technology for a purpose that did not mandate any specific aesthetic.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that the formal evaluation criteria it uses - like the composition submissions - don't frequently seem to be given assessments. On one hand, this doesn't really impact learning, since weekly lessons and the two semesterly meetings provide ample feedback, but it seems like an odd structure - and more timely feedback could be useful, especially since composition submissions are polished work (including notation), whereas I think lessons center more on work in progress (and rarely include discussion of notation where it is not critical).\r\n\r\nThe concert report felt very isolated from anything else in the course. I didn't feel that it helped my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course focused more on critically analyzing music, perhaps the music brought in by the guest speakers. This would involve looking at scores together as a class, pointing out effective notation, structure, development, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course is the freedom it allows. It is usually not a choice between making art and doing schoolwork.  The weaknesses are that it is often paced poorly due to the guest presentations, and it would be better if the assignments were spread out more evenly. "
