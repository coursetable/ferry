            "\u00a0I developed great critical reading and writing skills. I think Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville are best read and studied as a class because they are rather complex authors whose writings have various levels of meaning. I learned from cclass discussions and benefited from the conversations I had with my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to engage deeply with the more abstract concepts underlying American literature and explore the indirect dialogue extant between Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville in their development of an American voice. I grappled with concepts of the self and different levels of mediation and narration, and ultimately learned to better articulate and make concrete my arguments regarding these texts. ",
            "\u00a0This class encouraged critical thinking and collective discussion, fostered by difficult readings. The broad themes of the entire course could at times be abstract and confusing. However this level of difficulty meant that students gained an impressive amount of nuance from readings, discussions, and the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0All about Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville. ",
            "\u00a0This class was, as Professor Deming says, a real thought lab. I really appreciated the opportunity to think not just in a literary-critical sense but in a philosophical one to approach these texts, and I thought my writing and thinking improved as a result. "

            "\u00a0Best course I have taken at Yale! Professor Deming is absolutely INCREDIBLE! ",
            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed the selection of texts, as well as the class discussions surrounding them. The format of the course worked exceedingly well to craft an arc of understanding throughout the whole semester, as it felt like each new other introduced built upon the work of the last. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class include its great syllabus. The variety between poetry and prose, essay and fiction, really entailed engaging discourse. Professor Deming is unquestionably another strength of the course, as he always was capable of leading great class discussions and office hours. Occasionally, the class felt as though it would drift into minutiae of texts that took up too much time. There is so much to discuss, and it sometimes felt we missed some areas by spending too much energy on smaller portions of texts. ",
            "\u00a0An overall wonderful course. Keep Dickinson! ",
            "\u00a0I really, really loved this class, and I'm lucky I got to take it this year. The texts are incredible, the approach excellent, even the homework (a 2-page response paper once in the semester) apt and appropriate. The only thing I'll say is that Professor Deming calls on people in order-- he'll assign 1, 2, 3, etc. in the order he sees hands. The only problem with this is that a point you want to make can be totally off-topic once three other people have made varying comments before you, and a lot of the time people are just so desperate to get their point in that they don't really address what was actually said. Other than that, loved this course. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomend this class to another student at Yale, whether they are English majors or not. I think it was a great to hear different perspectives and thought the readings were very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Great class ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in American literature, and I wholeheartedly enjoyed each seminar discussion. Professor Deming is brilliant and frames questions in such a way that leads the class to new insights. Engaging with this kind of literature is important and affirming, and I had a wonderful time in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Abseloutely  the essays, poems, and novels that we read in the class are incredible, and Prof.Deming is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to another student, especially English majors. These hallmarks of American literature are excellent to read, and I think the organization of the class (with the response papers and questions) really lends itself to strong group learning. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Deming is a gem and conducts the seminars like a \"thoughtlab\" which is very fun. You'll learn a lot about life while reading great literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take it! Professor Deming is incredible, his feedback is detailed and helpful, the texts are true classics, and the course is overall wonderful. I learned so much this semester, and I wish more courses at Yale were set up in this format. "
