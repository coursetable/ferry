            "\u00a0L2 Arabic was a fabulous course. I started the semester barely able to introduce myself, and now I can carry on a halting but extended conversation. The course covers Modern Standard Arabic grammar concepts, such as different verb patterns. Fridays are devoted to practicing the shaami dialect with TFs. I learned more than I expected, and I appreciated Elham's focus on building students' intuition, including guessing the meaning of words based on their root and structure. ",
            "\u00a0Arabic! More MSA and  too. Just a natural progression from L1. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of the arabic language and am now able to hold conversation as well as read and write at a proficient level. ",
            "\u00a0I increased my Arabic vocabulary and grammar over the course of this semester. I expanded my Shaami speaking abilities as well as my ability to write in Fusha. ",
            "\u00a0- Arabic language writing, reading, speaking and listening skills to be an intermediate speaker\r\n- Different dialects from MSA to Shaami for official as well as local purposes\r\n- History and culture of Arab nations from the dance and food to the difference among the different countries ",
            "\u00a0Grammar and more advanced vocabulary of arabic ",
            "\u00a0I finished Al Kitaab - learning all the vocab and grammar from the book. This includes the past tense, future tense, and present tense conjugations for verbs; a major case ending; and the different types of sentence structures in Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0My Arabic Reading and writing has advanced tremendously (I already spoke before the class). ",
            "\u00a0I furthered my basic conversation and grammar skills and vocabulary in the areas of government, foreign affairs, and world politics. ",
            "\u00a0i learned fusha and shaami and also got a lot better at writing and grammar "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: A large portion of class every day is devoted to speaking practice. The homework is appropriate and helps student learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: As someone who had studied MSA previously but not the Shaami dialect, I would have appreciated additional resources to review Shaami. Resources are difficult to find online because dialect not often taught in university courses. ",
            "\u00a0Elham is great. Loved learning the language. She's very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very work heavy course. It is both a strength and weakness because the practice is needed in order to learn the language but it gets overwhelming. Also, it is fast paced so there is not much time to practice new vocabulary before getting a new set of vocab to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is absolutely amazing and if you want to learn and are wiling to put in the work, this is the course. She is amazing at breaking down the language so well. This course is absolutely amazing if you want to learn to improve your grammar and speaking skills. We focus on speaking in Shaami much less than writing in Fusha but the difference in where we started and where we ended is immense.\r\n\r\nThe workload for this class is intense. At the very least, skits should be posted a week in advance as sometimes we would be assigned it merely two days before we had to perform a 10 minute skit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good balance of formal arabic and dialect.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some of the projects are ridiculously time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- Kind, patient and helpful professor that teaches the course well and checks up on students for progress\r\n- Covering both standard Arabic and dialects to facilitate learning in different components of lives\r\n- Well paced home works, activities and exams for students\r\n- Great teaching assistants\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n- Maybe increase the staff seeing the demand of the course is high. The professor managed it to the best of her ability but it would be better if more staff was added to the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that a lot of material is covered in this course so I did learn a lot. A weakness is that the textbook often focused on words related to politics and diplomacy, so it wasn't geared towards students with other language goals. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn so much! within a year, it is crazy to reflect on how much of a completely new language, with a different alphabet system, I have learned. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: feedback took a while to receive, which is particularly challenging when trying to learn a new language. ",
            "\u00a0Theres a lot of work but the class is very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a substantial amount of work and consistently requires the highest level of commitment. I think the final project, an autobiographical video could be revised, because it is a huge amount of busy work and in MSA. We also often were on a time crunch and did not go over grammar or concepts studied for homework, such as irregular verb conjugations and grammatical structures. ",
            "\u00a0this is a very organized and well planned course with challenges and good lessons. I only wish that the format of classes could be a bit different each day and not so routine so that it wouldn't become tedious. we always approached the lesson with the same types of exercises in the same order, and more variety could have been nice "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Arabic is a beautiful and fascinating language. Elham is a wonderful professor, and the other students in my class were very dedicated. Your comprehension and conversation will improve enormously. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! It's a lot of work, but if you are willing to put it in, it's a really rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0yes if you are serious about learning arabic. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor for this course is what makes this course worthwhile. She has an amazing ability to break down complex rules (or lack thereof) into ways that are understandable and only upon taking this course do you truly understand not only how difficult Arabic is to learn but to teach. \r\n\r\nThis course has an incredibly high workload and it bleeds into your other classes.You reap what you sow. Genuinely, if you don't want to spend hours per night, do not take this course. We had 10 minute skits to memorize that would be assigned the day or two days before. However, if you want to learn, genuinely learn, this is the course to take. I am glad I took this course because the work I put in paid off. \r\n\r\nI don't regret it but this course may not be your cup of tea. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Arabic is a great language to learn and Elham is an awesome professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I took this course even after finishing my language requirement skills. It may seem hard first semester with all the home works and activities. But, you will get the hang of it and want to learn more about the language in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a good challenge if you want to continue studying Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in Arabic, then yes! It's a beautiful language with incredibly complex grammar that almost caters to a computer-science-algorithm-loving-type (think, \"if this word X fits this role Y in this sentence Z, then add P case ending to X\"). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that students should definitely take. ",
            "\u00a0If they wanted to learn MSA and were a native speaker, yes. ",
            "\u00a0yes, its a very cool language and a great course that teaches shaami and MSA at once "
