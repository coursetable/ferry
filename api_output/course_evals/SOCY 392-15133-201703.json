            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of knowledge in some subtler points of political science - namely what sorts of influences shape the political mind of a country and lead the people towards one opinion or another. We learned all we could about populism by coming at it from different angles - history (contemporary and older), style and discourse, and even human psychology and emotion. The class definitely stretched my mind and taught me to think more broadly about issues that seem confined to one field of study. ",
            "\u00a0How do define populist movements as a discourse, political style, and worldview - a phenomenon that emerges in representative democracies when certain socio-political circumstances align. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the size, the professor, and the readings. The small size was nice and not intimidating; I felt it was very easy to for us all to have a conversation and not have it feel like a typical competitive discussion session. (I wouldn't want the class to be much smaller, though). Professor Gorski was very engaging and nice, as well as approachable and helpful. Finally, the readings I thought were very good in this class. I enjoyed reading them and I felt they were all very relevant and insightful to the topics discussed each week; never any extraneous or needlessly long readings. The only weakness of this class was that I'm worried the final grade will effectively just be based mostly on the final paper. The reason I say this is that despite different assignments receiving different point values on the syllabus, we never discussed them or got any grades or feedback on them. Just an opinion, though! ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussions were great, but I think that what was missing was a discussion of social movement theory as a whole to better ground populist movements in the context of social movement theory. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a very systematic and thorough investigation of populism and its causes, motivations, dynamics, and consequences. The readings are interesting and Prof. Gorski facilitates the discussion well. The assignments were also well-spaced out and relevant, not just busy work. Finally, the organization of the class was also very good; I feel like we approached populism very systematically and came at it from every angle, making for a very interesting class over the course of the semester. If you have any interest in understanding the current state of affairs - in the US and other countries as well - you would do well to take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but ideally after, or at the same time as taking SOCY 216 ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you are interested in populism, particularly the recent populist movement in the United States as a large part of the course is dedicated to exploring its possible roots. If you are interested in the material, you will enjoy the readings and the seminar discussions. I really liked that we had a small class and were able to have honest and fluid conversations. There are not many assignments and you don't receive much feedback throughout the semester, so it can be difficult to know how you are doing in the course, but all in all, that is not a huge drawback. The relaxed nature of the assignments allows you to explore what you find most interesting about populism and really dive into that on the final paper. Professor Gorski is really nice and does not force his opinions on students, but rather asks questions to challenge them, which I appreciated. The subject is very relevant and important to know about, the readings are enjoyable, and the assignments are not that arduous, so overall, I'd recommend this course to another student as long as they're okay with the class structure.
