            "\u00a0I liked the readings we had and then the discussions we had on them; they were always interesting and engaging. The trips we took to the art museum and medical school were also amazing, interesting, and very fun. I thought the lectures were interesting, but sometimes we went through them too fast, so I didn't really understand. Maybe giving us time to take notes and going more slowly would help me retain more of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Some concepts were a little hard to grasp conceptually. The lectures moved at a pretty fast pace. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class with the instructor. She is a wonderful woman who welcomed us into her home and an even more inspiring instructor who is passionate about the work she does. She taught us in a manner that was engaging, informative and accessible. We learned through multiple mediums and really gained a full perspective on the immune system and the microbiome. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that it provided me with a lot of information. Also, the course allowed students to discuss information in class. A weakness of the course is that the information could have been presented a little better. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. It was structured very well, with class time split between lecture and open-ended discussions. A big strength was the small size of the class that allowed for lively discussion and culminated in a tight-knit group of peers. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: intellectually challenging; manageable workload; relevant, relatable readings; taught in an engaging way; good balance between lectures, class discussions, and hands-on activities \r\nweaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Kavathas who really paid attention to every student and ensured that they understood the immune system. I really enjoyed how this course not only used concepts from Molecular Biology but History of Science as well. I did not find any weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was informative and engaging. The discussions were very collaborative and Professor Kavathas had activities that helped with the learning process and engaged the class more. Some of the readings however were excessively long and tedious. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the insightful discussions we had over books and articles relevant to the immune system and other diseases, along with the brilliant professor. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was amazing and this course was well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very passionate and very understanding. ",

            "\u00a0One strength of the course is the organization. Another strength is the obvious joy you can see on Professor Kavathas's face when she teaches because she truly loves the subject matter. One weakness of the course is the fact that some readings are very long and dull. Another weakness is that the class size was big for a seminar, so sometimes it was hard to voice your opinion in discussion. The course can be improved by cutting the irrelevant sections in longer readings and cutting down the class size. "
