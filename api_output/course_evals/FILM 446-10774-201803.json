This involved analyzing Japanese films with knowledge of historical context in Japan as well as how the meaning of Japanese in \"Japanese Cinema\" has been understood over time. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It was very interesting material and I feel like I learned a lot about older film in general as well as specifically Japanese film and culture at the time. Professor is great and class is good for all levels of experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its interesting material and professor Gerow is one of the premier scholars of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in familiarizing yourself with Japanese films and understanding Japanese history through this lens, I would recommend this class. Professor Gerow is very knowledgable about the subject of this course. Also, you get to watch great films each week and practice listening in Japanese. "
