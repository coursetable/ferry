            "\u00a0The material is tough, and the professor did not help with that. The lectures could be confusing and convoluted, and the homework relies heavily on programming because the equations are too hard to solve analytically. We only got one homework back because there was no TF. ",
            "\u00a0This course NEEDS to have a TA or TF or someone other than the professor to help explain topics and hold extra office hours when the multiple explanations of the professor ultimately do not make sense no matter how many times they try. ",

We also only received a single homework back, so there was a significant lack of good feedback. ",
