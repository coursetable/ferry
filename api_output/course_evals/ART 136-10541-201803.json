            "\u00a0I developed better technical skills in the darkroom and was able to explore film/black and white photography as an art form. I developed an appreciation for the patience and carefulness inherent to working in the darkroom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate pictures and understand what makes a picture make you want to keep looking. I enjoyed taking pictures, especially portraits, but the best parts of this class to me were going through the contact sheets, choosing what to print, and making prints /adjusting prints -- that's where I learned the most. I took this class without any background in art or photography and the learning curve was such that from the very beginning you can produce art you are proud of, but you also get to watch yourself improve so much. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of photography, the science and mechanics of photography, how to develop and make prints, and how to navigate taking pictures in different environments. ",
            "\u00a035mm film shooting, processing and printing; how to choose subject, compose and frame photographs when shooting; considering light in photographs; exposure to multiple forms of expositions of photography, including galleries, museums, photography books, slide shows, and artist critiques ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to shoot and develop film and make prints in the darkroom. I also learned how to think critically about photography as an art form, and how to express myself through my work. ",
            "\u00a0A total waste of a class. Just buy a camera and have fun by yourself. You dont learn anything new. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to a medium that I previously knew next to nothing about. I feel very confident in the basic practical skills that I learned, both in the darkroom developing and on the street shooting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The assignments weren't particularly inspiring to shoot for, although I really enjoyed taking the open subject rolls. Critiques could also be focused more on the photographic work itself, rather than the stories behind them. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very expensive course-- around $500 between materials & darkroom fee (and I was able to use a borrowed camera). There are some ways around this cost (like yale safety net and college CPA grants), so reach out to the professor about that. \r\n\r\nWe also spent way too much time in this course learning about the early evolution of photography -- it was all we talked about for 3-4 of our early class sessions. This time would have been way better spent by looking at photographs, which is something we ended up having to speed through when we finally got to it. \r\n\r\nA strength of the course is that the professor and other students are ready to meet you where you are at: if you are more advanced, you can get really useful advice & criticism, and if you are just starting they will also have great pointers. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of independent work. It is definitely worth the effort, and spending a lot of the time in the darkroom can be really gratifying, but you will not get much feedback throughout the semester, which was sometimes frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The course made film photography feel accessible; even though I was totally new to art, I gained confidence in my work over the course of the semester. It was really helpful having class time in the dark room to solicit feedback on our work and walk through the developing and printing process. I also enjoyed the guest lectures, the field trip to New York, and the opportunities we had to interact with students in the MFA program. It would have been helpful if the students in the class had more opportunities to give each other feedback or discuss professional and each others' work. I also would have liked to spend more time learning about the history of film photography; our trip to the YCBA at the start of the semester was really great and it would have been interesting to have more focused lectures on photo history throughout the semester, because the artist surveys, while super interesting, can be pretty fleeting. ",
            "\u00a0Lisa is amazing!! Only suggestion I have is that she check for contact sheets periodically throughout the semester.... wouldve helped me to stay up with assignments ",
            "\u00a0I thought the darkroom walk-through lessons were very clear and efficient, especially as I was pretty nervous beforehand about learning everything. I also think that pairing the hands-on lessons in the darkroom with art history lessons in the classroom was great. I wish that we had had more freedom with what we presented in our first two crits, so that I wouldn't have to worry about including something from each assignment and could focus more on curating a coherent miniature body of work. ",
            "\u00a0Cost of supplies was way too expensive. Yale should pay for it... it's school supplies and because of the cost, people are turned off from taking the course. Everyone should be able to take this class if they want to. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, because it's a great way to intimately engage with photography as an art medium. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are able to dedicate the amount of time necessary (you have to shoot 3 rolls a week and develop and make prints on your own time). You receive a lot of instruction in the beginning which sets you up to complete all this work, but you do not receive much feedback on your actual photos. ",
            "\u00a0yes; very well-constructed course, well-led by professor Kereszi, great intro to photography for people with all levels of experience and interest ",
            "\u00a0This is an accessible intro to film photography. Really enjoyed the course as someone with zero prior art experience. Through in-class lectures, darkroom time, and crits, I felt I gained confidence as a photographer and learned to assess my work in new ways. Lisa and Kaitlin provided helpful feedback and were really encouraging. To me, the class depends in large part on how much work you put into the assignments, so it requires a consistent commitment throughout the semester. There's some exposure to the history of film photography, but it's a pretty brief survey; this class is more about learning the basics of film. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. I had no previous photography experience and learned so much without feeling overwhelmed. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, but only take it if you are really interested in photography ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, although only if they are actually willing to put in the work. If I'd had a busier semester, I could have easily felt bogged down by all the hours shooting, developing, and printing. "
