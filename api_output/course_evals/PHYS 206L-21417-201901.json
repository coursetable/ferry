            "\u00a0I want to be a theorist! Honestly, the only thing I learned from this course is how frustrating it is to analyze data and write weekly reports. If you are taking this course with the hope that you will be taught anything, you will be sorely disappointed. There is absolutely no explanation as to how to perform analysis, which is honestly probably the worst part of the course. They just kind of give you a lab manual and let you roam free. Very disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0This exam marginally increased my skills in Microsoft Excel and helped secure some of the fundamentals of introductory Physics which I learned in high school. I became very familiar with lengthy error propagations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how circuitry worked, mainly through the Digital Logic, Resonant Circuits, and Power Supplies labs. I learned that I am not an engineer, and if I am to do experimental work in the future, I need a lot of hands-on experience. This lab was a challenge for me because it presented a lot of new equipment and techniques. I think the most important skill that I learned in this lab was how to analyze data and write a lab report. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to work effectively with a partner. It reinforced the systematic nature of working through experiments successfully. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about and perform a lot of the famous experiments described in the introductory physics sequence. You also learn how to write lab reports in a much more rigorous way than in 205. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various aspects of physics in doing this lab. Much more in-depth than the experiments in 205L. ",
            "\u00a0This class was best at teaching me how to do error propagation and work with more than just a handful of data points. The questions on the experiment guides are not necessarily ones that I'd seen in prior physics classes, so answering them required a lot of though and research. I also had to learn how to derive formulas because the ones on the handouts were not always correct ",
            "\u00a0I learned, really for the first time, to do more self-guided experimentation in the lab setting. The unique setup of this course, which involves students choosing 8-9 experiments out of a possible 23 to complete throughout the semester with the same lab partner, is very different and a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work with equipment in a physics laboratory, analyze data, and write lab reports in LaTex. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at taking initiative to complete hands on tasks, improvising, and analyzing data. "

            "\u00a0The lab manuals suck hard. They do not tend to explain the theory well despite their incredible length and they are very ambiguous in explaining what they wanted (which led to frustration and tension with the TA, who, as of reading week, has yet to have grade over half of my and my partner's lab reports, so if you were expecting feedback, too bad). Some of the labs are pretty neat and make me love science, but then I have to go back home and analyze the data with little to no aid from my TA, which then makes me hate science. ",
            "\u00a0The lab guides were incoherent, which made completing the labs utterly miserable. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave students access to real experimental apparatus and allowed a certain degree of freedom and exploration. However, such exploration was immediately weighed down by the lengthy and often unclear reports which followed. While students were able to gain intuition for how the physics of a certain apparatus affected the quantitative results, the analysis of the results was often very convoluted and even unrelated in nature. Additionally, there were a few errors in the equations derived in lab write ups, and even when errors were not present, much of the language and notation was difficult to understand for students without extensive lab experience. \r\n\r\nBeyond the reports, the class also struggled in its structuring. While my TA was a well informed physicist, I still had some difficulties receiving help from them in a timely manner via email. ",
            "\u00a0The lab is strong in that it teaches prospective physics majors a lot of the equipments and techniques experimentalists and engineers use on a daily basis. However, I wish the instructors were more explicit about how to write a lab report and what specific components of each lab should be included in the report. We are more than willing to put in the work, but it is often difficult when we dont know what the graders are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Some lab guides seemed more up to date than others. I would have appreciated more guidance as to how to write a lab report. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how this lab gave us the choice to pick experiments and how I learned a lot from each experiment. I only wish there were a bit more of a structured help system in place for the lab prep and wrietups. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses are typos in lab handouts. Sometimes equations are miswritten and that causes computation based off of data to be near impossible, which is very stressful and exhausting. Going through all of the lab reports and editing them thoroughly to make sure every question can be answered is very important.\r\n\r\nThe class is great at teaching physics topics that aren't taught in intro courses, like optics, superconductivity, and nuclear reactions, which are all very cool. ",
            "\u00a0The unique structure of this course, as well as the fact that most of the experiments are objectively cooler than anything you will have done in any other one of your classes are the main strengths of the class. No other class will allow you and your partner to have full use of a particle accelerator for three hours with no interruptions. The TA's are also largely extremely helpful and attentive, without whom the experiments would be far more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were in workload, grading, feedback, and learning structure. First, for a half-credit course, this course has a wholly inappropriate amount of work. The work in the course, with absolutely no exaggeration, is the equivalent of two full credit courses at the very least. The grade is entirely based on the typed lab reports you submit each week (i.e. no exams). Though it is claimed that lab reports can be \"3 pages,\" this is a blatant lie if you want to get even close to a good grade. Instead, you end up typing 12-20 pages of essays, equations, and tables every single week with no help except for your lab partner (because usually, no other group is doing the same experiment as you during the same week) on a physics subject that you have little time to fully understand from the lab manual, even if you have learned about it theoretically in the separate lecture course. Then, when you get your grade back, you are always left confused you often never get any actual feedback or comments, and when you do, the grades do not match anything about the initial rubric you were given. From hearsay, it seems that many students get very low grades for the weekly lab reports, but there is no information whatsoever about how these grades will or will not be curved to the final grade. Even the \"Details\" function to see average grades has been completely disabled on Canvas for this course, so there is literally no way to see how you are doing at any point. You just have to hope. That is not how a course should be evaluated. ",
            "\u00a0The labs for 206 are so much more fun than the 205 labs! 9 lab reports is a lot for one semester, though; it might be more beneficial to spend two weeks on each lab, get more insight into the phenomena being investigated, and only write 4-5 reports for the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't develop habits for writing good lab reports in PHYS 205L, so I came into this class writing poor lab reports. I neglected to learn the expectations of the labs until after turning in a few already. My strengths were using technology to expedite data analysis. "

            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE SECOND SEMESTER OF YOUR FIRST YEAR!!!!!! The amount of knowledge that they assume and lack of prerequisite classes is astonishing. Also, learning Python/having previous research experience (which ironically seems to defeat the purpose of this class) before taking this class would probably be very helpful. You also get to choose your own labs, and your choices will make or break your semester. Since you are here, you probably have to take this class, so instead of wasting time telling you not to take it (which you shouldn't unless you have to), I will tell you which labs I would and would not recommend. I would suggest (based on first-hand experience and talking with my peers) not to touch Millikan Oil Drop, Acoustic Resonance, Transistor Amplifiers, Resonant Circuits, or Nuclear Reactions with a 49-and-a-half-foot pole. Definitely do Charge-to-Mass, Applications of Interferometry, and Superconductivity. ",
            "\u00a0Avoid at all costs. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to any student who was not strongly interested in physics and experienced in lab beyond the physics 205 lab. This course expects a certain degree of self motivation and ingenuity to succeed in, and while I am glad I took the course, I just as easily could have taken the 165 166 track of physics lab and recovered approximately 5 hours per week which I spent deciphering confusing lab reports and crafting detailed introductions, procedures, and conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0If the student enjoys experimental physics and has experience writing formal lab reports, I would recommend this lab. However, for novice physics students, the challenge of this lab might end up inhibiting the learning. A student might be so lost in the theory and multiple steps of the lab that they lose sight of what the lab is even asking them to find (especially in some of the circuitry labs). My lab partner and I often went overtime on our labs, so students should be prepared for that. ",
            "\u00a0More interesting than 205, but probably would not take if it was not required. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that definitely want to do physics. The labs are fun for the most part, but the lab write ups can be very time consuming and aren't that fun. Must be definitely committed to physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes as long as you are willing to do a lot of extremely unnecessary work to do some very enjoyable and interesting experiments. ",
            "\u00a0If youre a physics major, yes (you have to take it anyway). Definitely try to find out who your TF will be ahead of time. I had a fantastic TF, and my experience in 206 was pretty good. Based on what other friends have told me, having a bad TF in lab can ruin your semester. After a pretty negative 205 experience, I was very skeptical about 206, but it exceeded my expectations! Most of the time, the labs were pretty fun and my group finished early, as opposed to 205, where I had to stay late to finish really trivial parts of labs that didnt teach me anything new about physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, It taught great practical skills, time management, and pacing on long assignments. "
