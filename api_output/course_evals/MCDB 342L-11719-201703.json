            "\u00a0Having never taken a biology lab course or worked in a biology lab, this class was an amazing introduction to a lot of techniques and processes being used in current nucleic acids research. ",
            "\u00a0Lab techniques like PCR and cloning ",
            "\u00a0I really learned a lot about how biology labs tackle problems using some modern techniques to study a signal cascade pathway. I also learned exactly how the methods we used work, and how to fix any errors. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of actually relevant lab techniques, not basic examples that no one actually uses in a real lab. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how real research is carried out (kinda...lots of safety nets because of Prof. Nelson and the TAs) ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory behind different experimental techniques used in biology wet labs. Professor Nelson told us about what different reagants are for and why we have to handle certain materials in specific conditions. It was really great because in the other research lab I work in, while I do learn a little bit about stuff like this, there often isn't as much time, so it was great to get some background from this class that I can take with me as I continue to do research in the future. "

            "\u00a0Though meeting twice a week was sometimes rough, and we had occasional late lab meetings, I don't know if there's much I would change to the course. Sometimes it's a slog, but you really learn a lot from the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Nelson is the best person to explain everything in the lab. I honestly feel he could teach a class just on biotechnology I would take it in a heartbeat. He also really cares about his students, going above and beyond to make everything possible\r\n\r\nWeakness: This is just inherent in the fact that we are doing new stuff in biology so not everything goes as planned when you have a bunch of undergrads trying the Luciferase assay for the first time. I felt that the TAs weren't as good at handling everything. Might be worth having Prof Nelson and the TAs meet before each class, go over the game plan, and think of any possible room for error. It justdidn't feel like they were on the same page. ",
            "\u00a0Goes on for a long time, but not much work outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this lab is not boring. It, in fact, is pretty engaging, as you're working on a real project with real implications (even if plants aren't your do or die). I think the way to think about this course is as if you *are* doing real research-- that way, when you have to stay til 7 pm one day (*weakness*) it feels like it's still on your terms.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class takes a great deal of your time, though thankfully doesnt impose too much on your life outside of class. the variation in how long you have to be in lab each day can also make people anxious but generally expect to invest a lot of time each week in lab ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this class is that you get to work on a real project that another lab has commissioned the class to do.  Because of this, it didn't feel like we were doing busy work but rather that we were working towards a larger goal. That being said, one weakness of the class was that sometimes the procedures and timeline of each class changed, but often things weren't communicated to us super clearly. "

            "\u00a0A great way to get your biology lab requirement met, and the professors and TAs are very supportive, patient, and helpful! ",
            "\u00a0This is probably the best lab class I've taken at Yale. Gen Chem was rough, orgo was no fun, and physics is physics. So it was a real relief taking a no-pressure class where I was learning stuff relevant to now. Prof Nelson is such an amazing professor and genuinely cares that EVERY one gets something out of this class. He would also do his best to minimize the time we spent in lab.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, it was real time sink putting in upwards of 8-10 hours a week but it was much less of a workload than the other possibilities of MCDB labs. ",
            "\u00a0Good to meet your lab credit but be aware that the class usually runs late, and sometimes very late. You'll learn a lot of practical bench work techniques and the professor is incredibly kind and approachable if you have questions or want to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Having two TA's really made the class a lot better. Pretty chill for seniors who take it. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend the lab. Although warning: the final paper is brutal and took much, much of my time and brain energy. I recommend starting on it as early as when you finish your first experiment (we do three big ones in the class). Also, try to understand what you're doing as you're doing it-- improves the overall experience and makes the final paper easier. Overall, this lab was a GREAT way to do the bio lab requirement for either MCDB or pre-med. I'm glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Just Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. I really liked that we got to work on actual projects instead of just learn techniques. "
