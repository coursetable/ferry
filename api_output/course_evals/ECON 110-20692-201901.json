            "\u00a0I had very limited knowledge about economics prior to enrolling in this class, and upon taking it, I became aware of market structures and how to evaluate them. Analysis of these structures required broad explanations at the onset before fine-tuning them to understand basic functionings of the economy. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: well taught and explained, psets are very helpful, class is engaging\r\nweaknesses: only 2 exams which makes it very difficult, the curve is bad ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Tolga is a great professor and really helps you learn. The problem sets reflect the exams, and Tolga holds weekly office hours where you can get help with the homework and clarify concepts. Weaknesses: sometimes certain topics are rushed, so it's critical to keep studying and reading the textbook on your own. Also, more practice questions would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall, one recommendation I have is that currently, the duopoly models (Cournot, Stackelberg, etc.) are taught with MC=0, but this is not usually the case in problems from te homework or the tests, so it was a little confusing. Other than that, no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course has 1 more midterm, so that the students could learn from their experience and improve more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Relating economic concepts to real world examples which help to truly understand economics; the lecture videos which helped to review concepts that were gone over class ",
            "\u00a0Tolga sets it up for you to succeed, with office hours and tutor office hours and the videos online. I learned a ton, wouldn't change much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It prepares you well for upper level Econ classes. This class is not really comparable to AP Econ classes; it is at a higher level. I also liked the professor; he was really funny and knowledgeable about the material. He is also always available to answer students' questions, both after class and during his office hours, and I liked that he held so many review sessions during reading week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The second half of the semester moves through the material way too quickly, so that you end up being less confident about the material going into the final. Also, though I really liked the professor, he would sometimes rush through the material after going off on long tangents. When you asked him questions, he would just explain the material the same way. I'd recommend going to the peer tutor office hours just so you can hear someone explain the material in a different way, which helped me a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the method in which it was taught through graphs to aid understanding and problem sets that allow each student to practice the various inputs for each subject. A weakness of this class is that the material is so abstract that it becomes difficult to quantify in everyday terms and can be challenging to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The professor's lectures were very helpful in understanding course material. Lectures were pretty interesting and engaging, as he offered many examples for the concepts he was explaining. He also offered a good amount of help on the Psets, so if a student takes enough initiative, he/she should be able to do well in the class. A weakness of the course was the pace  it sometimes felt like we moved very quickly. If a student doesn't understand one concept, it's really hard to understand all future concepts, since they build on each other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Tolga's teaching skills, class size, ease in asking questions, accessible office hours for both the TA and professor\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes material was taught a little too quick ",
            "\u00a0the class was strong because Tolga kept things exciting and always is very clear with what he's teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and allowed both student-professor learning relationships and student-student ones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this class were the engaging lectures and pset study groups. The course could be improved if the instructor wrote a little more slowly and engaged more with the textbook, since it was difficult to read the textbook alone without any help. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga makes sure you learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very organized and developed after all these years of revision. Requirements are clarified with detailed explanation and practice. I cannot think of a specific weakness, except that it only covers a portion of the textbook. More interesting material might be incorporated. "

            "\u00a0yes, i think it was well taught and i learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you can take it with Tolga! He makes lectures extremely engaging, which allowed me to appreciate the field of economics. I believe knowledge of microeconomics is essential regardless of your major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since this class was enjoyable I would recommend it to anyone interested in economics to see if they like it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because you learn a lot and Tolga is a great professor who helps you to truly understand economics. He is also always willing to help if you are struggling in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Would wholeheartedly recommend it. Seminar setting makes you pay more attention, and you end up learning so much. Plus, Tolga is quite funny! ",
            "\u00a0If they are only looking for a QR credit, I would not recommend this class; I'd recommend finding a better QR class or taking the lecture for the curve. I would only recommend this class if you are passionate about Econ or if you enjoy really challenging classes. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. If you do not have a strong econ background and do not want to put in the work for the course (i.e do the readings & study), then this is NOT the course for you. A lot of people in this seminar are econ majors and/or have some econ background, so you have to put in the work to be able to compete.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise Tolga is a great lecturer and I'm glad I took this class with him. My only regret is that I did poorly on the final (due to understudying). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class with caution as economics is usually a difficult thing for students to pick up. It is very beneficial for future careers but learning to separate abstract concepts with what is happening in reality is crucial for prospective economists. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course; it's very possible to do well if you put in enough time/effort, and you will gain a solid foundational understanding of microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0The class (specifically because of the smaller size) is a great way to learn microeconomics. It is easier to ask questions in the smaller class size. ",
            "\u00a0I mean Tolga's great, I just don't like econ so I didn't really like the class. The curve is also rough in the seminar if you haven't taken econ in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend everyone take this class, even if it is only to understand what other students are talking about. Although I am personally opposed to much of the ideology of the Economics department, there is much to be learned and this is a gateway to that knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Great skills to learn, great professor with great stories. Professor Koker is somebody who you want to meet as a freshman. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to go into econ. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, regardless of intention of being an ECON major. Economic literacy is rather important in understanding the world today. The course does lay a solid foundation for more advanced econ learning. "
