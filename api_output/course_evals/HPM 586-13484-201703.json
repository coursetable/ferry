            "\u00a0Overall, I learned a lot from this course. I think having a brand new instructor who is a post-doc teach the course was rough at first. Please see comments below on Question 7. ",
            "\u00a0Useful information, would have been better to just teach it as micro economics, and did not try and stretch it to fit healthcare, which sometimes made it more confusing.  The in class activities were mostly ineffective teaching methods, but I appreciated the attempt.  In particular the consulting firm and bidding games were kind of a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was inexperienced and unclear on many of the topics. The exams and quizzes were not clear and did not reflect knowledge base. The TA sections were excellent, however, this is an important foundational course and needs to be taught by someone more experienced. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very challenging and discussion sections were very conducive to my personal learning. Some in-class activities were less helpful, and this may have been due in part to the time constraints. The last few lectures were very enjoyable, because the class became more health-centric after we were able to apply our learned concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Microeconomics for health policy is a very dense, quantitative subject and unfortunately the course wasn't taught in the most clear and cogent manner. Lecture was very disorganized and many students relied on office hours for clarity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot!! the material was presented in a clear, logical manner, and lectures largely were incredibly helpful. When there were gaps in my knowledge, section was a blessing and made such a difference. I really do feel like I much better understand economics now! Would suggest changing the last 2 weeks of class---I didn't learn much from the consulting exercise (felt very fake and cursory and not in-depth enough) or from the last week's discussion of the paper. Would prefer to have 2 additional lectures worth of material to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved really fast, and it was often hard to relate each topic to the next. ",
            "\u00a0There is quite a bit of material covered in one session; perhaps splitting into two classes per week would be more conducive to understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Good materials overall, but more healthcare related contents would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Overall great course for anyone with little to no exposure to microeconomics. The second half of the semester I found to be most beneficial for health policy and healthcare management students, as it really connected themes we were learning about in other courses to much larger economic issues. ",
            "\u00a0decent class for microecon. Not too hard material and just the right speed/pace ",
            "\u00a0The course wasn't too tough, but I think that it would be better if the TA sessions every week were actually a part of the course because they are helpful, but given the unknown scheduling during enrollment were difficult to attend sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The power points can be clearer ",
            "\u00a0very interesting material, but I was frustrated that we were not given feedback on exams and quizzes. It made it incredibly challenging to learn from these evaluations considering we were not made aware what where we went wrong. ",
            "\u00a0strength: a very good introduction course for microeconomics, even for someone who has not taken a maths module in the past 4 years. the topics are closely related to health care thus may have good application in our future career. \r\n\r\nweakness: the lesson occasionally goes a little fast ",

            "\u00a0Good intro course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n- TA (Kayla) was exceptionally good at coming at content from a different angle to help make it accessible\r\n\r\n- Problem sets worked well (maybe just make them mandatory for 10% of final grade or something?)\r\n\r\n- Good coverage of basic concepts, well ramped\r\n\r\n- Liked it actually addressed health-related concerns\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- Stefano started off weak, but got much better through the runtime of the course\r\n\r\n- Confusion over how participation grade was calculated, this didn't bother me but was frequently bemoaned by peers\r\n\r\n- Course content could've been better integrated ",
            "\u00a0Course was too fast paced for most people as evident by grade distributions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TFs were approachable and knowledgeable; homework was well-written and, I felt, where I really learned the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was poorly conducted, often resulting in the professor spending far too long answering individuals' questions and, hence, being forced to push through complicated topics (elasticity, nash equilibriums) in what little time remained; the miderm/final were far too long and failed to push students to engage with the material in a more nuanced, meaningful way; the consulting exercise was a colossal waste of time; other than the homework and lecture on Arrow's paper, this course had almost nothing to do with health care. ",
            "\u00a0This is surprisingly the first time I have ever taken economics throughout the entire academic career, and I genuinely enjoyed it. As a Health Policy student, Microecon was incredibly helpful towards my understanding of public health initiatives. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material, especially towards the later portion of the course when the relevance to the health care field became more apparent. The beginning of the semester was more challenging, particularly because the exams were very different than the material learned in lecture (much more math/calculations on the exams, and much more theoretical in lecture). ",
            "\u00a0There was a greater emphasis on micro economics in general, rather than for health care professionals. There was only a total of 3 weeks of material on health care economics. ",
            "\u00a0I quite liked the subject and the course overall. Since there was a lot of material, I found that it was almost necessary to read the textbook ahead of the lectures. The discussion sections were also very helpful to digest the material. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: realized how essential economics is to health care and public health\r\nweaknesses: this realization was not made until the end, the majority of the course was not tied to public health ",
            "\u00a0The class was good, definitely stronger at the end with primary papers by Akerloff, Spence, and Arrow.\r\n\r\nI think the class could be strengthened by further integrating the mathematical aspects of microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Stefano did move quickly during class, but he only had less than 2 hours face time with us so it was not his fault.  I did attend section and his office hours, which also helped a lot.  It seemed most did not take advantage of his office hours.  I would have been nice to have met twice a week instead of once. ",
            "\u00a0I think Stefano could have done a better job aligning his lectures to Abbey's material.  There were some disconnects apparent in themes and I felt I might not be learning what is most important for *public health* microecon as opposed to *generally* in microecon.  Sometimes the slides were unclear as well, and I felt like Abbey might have had something specific she said every year at that slide, but since we weren't hearing it it made less sense.\r\nOverall, the homework practice helped me to understand the concepts a lot and hammered home the material. ",
            "\u00a0This is a difficult course for those who have never encountered economics. The key strengths are in the organization of the slides, as well as the brilliant instruction provided by the teaching assistants. In addition, Stefano was always available when needed, and provided fantastic instruction one-on-one. \r\n\r\nHaving never studied economics, I found the pace of the lectures a little fast and struggled to keep up. This was soon remedied when I began attending the TA sessions - these are an invaluable adjunct that will lead to a rapid comprehension of sometimes abstruse information. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good introduction to microeconomics, but it would have been helpful to have each concept tied back to healthcare related topics. ",
            "\u00a0Course content is good. Its a very intro based class.\r\nMaybe meeting for three hours a week as a class, instead of 1.5 hours, would allow us to cover more content! At least we can do macro economics too! ",
            "\u00a0The testing model was a little unfair. After being told that our 30 minute  quiz would cover a couple of weeks, we were surprised the week before when the professor told us it would act as yet another midterm. ",

            "\u00a0Once Stefano got into the rhythm of things, his lectures were clear. His enthusiasm for making sure we have learned the material (and his enthusiasm for providing the tools to help us succeed in the course) was conducive to my learning, and I was glad he made himself very available for office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Solid. Clearly really cared about the class. Sometimes was a bit too slow or didn't make a ton of sense, but 80% of the time it was good. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was very smart and did care about his students doing well, but I think he expected many students to come in with a basic understanding with economics and that was not the case. He moved much faster than the class was comfortable with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Receptive to students' suggestions, was accessible in open office hours\r\n\r\nTo improve: Better time management may add to course's flow and ease of understanding; \r\n\r\nI recommend highlighting main points of a concept to make it clearer to the student the context. Also, allocating more time to the math and numeric portions of problems and concepts that will be tested and less time for more abstract concepts that will be iterated again later when the math is done. \r\n\r\nActivities were somewhat helpful but took a lot of time away from teaching time, and sometimes math and concepts were left out to revise on students' own. ",
            "\u00a0Tried his best to accommodate students. ",
            "\u00a0Stefano was clearly very knowledgeable about economics and actively tried to stimulate student interest in the content he presented. The only thing I would suggest improving, is that because he is an expert in the field of economics, it was sometimes difficult to understand things he'd explain because his knowledge base was significantly greater than our own. I fear he sometimes assumed the audience knew much more than we did, and as a result we were sometimes confused when he described things a certain way or when answering questions. ",
            "\u00a0Very direct professor and not willing to sugarcoat things, which is a good thing. Although, maybe can be a bit more sensitive in terms of being able to listen to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Was fine but could have been more organized ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the material of this course, but I would say that for the most time, it was challenging to communicate with Stefano. He would take questions in class, but would not answer them and would talk about things unrelated. There was also an instance in which a student asked a question and he falsely assumed that that student was the only one with that question and did not answer it. He rejected this question in a manner that came off as quite rude. ",
            "\u00a0Stefano has shown great effort to make this course interesting and provided many interactions with us. There were fun group work during the classes and it is a better learning journey than simply listening to the lecturer. the extra quiz also provided us opportunity to learn what we have misunderstood during the first half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching may be improved by being a bit more clear with explanations ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Carattini would visibly get frustrated with us at times, but ofteb that was due to him not staying on track time wise. He also expressed disappointment over our performance on the consulting activity, but we had little time to prepare and our panelists enjoyed our presentations. In addition, he designed exams and especially quizzes that were too long which did not seem to serve a true purpose. There were ways to design an equally challenging and less confusing shorter exam. \r\n\r\nI do understand this was his first time teaching this course and any course at YSPH. With that said, he did a pretty good job, but his Teaching Fellows definitely made up in the areas where he lacked. ",
            "\u00a0I think that he got much better as the course went on, from a fairly low initial base to quite a competent and articulate professor. I would merely advise he skips the first stage in future. Overall, I think while I would give him a solid tick of approval (accounting that this is his first time teaching) but hope he incorporates his experience into future classes (as he did within this course). ",
            "\u00a0Expert in the field, very knowledgeable\r\nHas trouble explaining things to student/ reading students confusion. ",
            "\u00a0I like Professor Stefano. I feel that he's an extremely intelligent person who struggled in the larger lecture settings. In small-class settings, conversely, Stefano is very, very good at working through and explaining complex topics. \r\n\r\nMy main issue though is not with Professor Stefano but with the department/school. A solid understanding of economics, as far as I understand, is integral to health policy/management work. The HPM department, at least, consists of a number economists by training, economists who now work actively in health or health care. The class of 2019 is the largest cohort to come through YSPH perhaps ever. So why, for this large class, for such a fundamental subject, did the administration ultimately decide to task a non-departmental, non-health care affiliated professor with this course? I understand that Professor Friedman is on maternity leave; I understand that staffing is complex and that, perhaps, this was the best use of available resources. Still, it does make me wonder about how much the departmental faculty here cares about me and my education. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good for an opt-in professor--incredibly intelligent, and easy to follow during lectures. I appreciated the opportunities for allowing students to apply the material during lectures through exercises during class. Says \"very good\" a lot. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the semester, lectures moved a bit too quickly, and students often felt intimidated approaching Stefano to ask questions. He became more approachable over the course of the semester though, and frequently sought feedback to improve his teaching. His accent was a bit difficult to understand at times, but he tried his best and was very willing to repeat things if necessary. ",

            "\u00a0I understand Professor Stefano was a substitute for this course. However, I was disappointed with his teaching style. During class he sometimes spent a large amount of time on a topic that was not important or part of the course content, and then breezed over the material that was more complex and needed more explanation. He often times did not answer students' questions directly and on more than one occasion made errors when trying to teach content on the board to students during lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Stefano is a very bight guy, and it was his first time teaching this course.  I have nothing to compare it to, but I did take away a lot of information which I did not know prior to taking this class.  I learned a lot about econ, and thought he did a great job. ",
            "\u00a0I think a lot of students were frustrated by the fact that they didn't absorb everything immediately upon going to lecture and without reading the material.  I think this was an immature assumption to make, but all of my undergrad was like that, so I expected courses here to be like that too.  I do not think that was a problem with the instructor, I think that is the nature of grad school--it is harder and goes faster.  I definitely learned a lot of things from Stefano, and given this was his first course, I think he did a good job with room for improvement as all instructors have.\r\nThe improvement would come from stressing more of what Abbey's slides stress and being clearer at the beginning about expectations.  I think it was good when Stefano told us to read the book *before* coming to class, but maybe it would have helped to say that at the beginning of the year.  I did not always read the book before class, but knowing that it was expected and that what the audience the lecture was built for made me more comfortable not understanding the material completely upon leaving the classroom.  I knew I had more work to do on it. ",

There appeared to be an assumption of prior knowledge, which made initially grasping the lectures difficult. \r\n\r\nStefano was quick to respond to feedback, however, and readily answered questions in class, as well as outside of class. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot by sitting for 45 minutes with him - a cloud was lifted and it made sense. His grasp of the subject cannot be underestimated. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend attending the personal teaching sessions with Stefano as well as the office hours from the beginning. This can be a difficult subject to catch up on if you fall behind! ",
            "\u00a0Stefano wants to see students succeed and is available to help students with specific questions they may have during office hours.\r\nIt would help if the instructor paced each class session based on feedback from students and reiterate topics when students have specific questions.

            "\u00a0This is a microeconomics speed round.  It moves very fast and there are a lot of details that you have to know and understand.  You will gain a lot of knowledge from this course, and be able to think critically about health care in a whole new way.  Be prepared to do extra work outside of class because of this. ",
            "\u00a0This is a difficult course for those who have never come across economic concepts. Economics is a fascinating and strangely beautiful subject that requires patience to fully internalise its concepts.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these possible difficulties, I would advise attending office hours from the beginning and reaching out to Profs/lecturers sooner rather than later when stumped. \r\n\r\nGood luck and enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0This course is ideal for students with no background in economics or business.  The course goes in depth on basic microeconomics concepts to set a framework for students' understanding of the healthcare system. ",
            "\u00a0Its a standard intro Econ course .. not overwhelming and its interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to anyone, ever. "
