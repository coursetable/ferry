            "\u00a0An understanding of media as a structuring force; an appreciation of the power of institutions; a critical eye for the empowering messages so often sold by digital elites. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly have no idea. But I think a lot more about media now... and know more history of media. ",
            "\u00a0The historical advancement of media and how it links in to digital media today. Super interesting inquisitive and interdisciplinary study! ",
            "\u00a0I became mroe aware of how digital media has affected my daily life and I appreciate the insight it gave me into the technology sector. I have always been interested in these topics, but did not have the opportunity to study them in depth until now. ",
            "\u00a0This course really did well to encompass everything from past technology incorporated in society to social media and its effects in the world today. I learned a lot about the philosophical end of technology and now see the effect technology has on the world in a critical versus analytical way. ",
            "\u00a0I knew virtually nothing before starting this course, which is why I took it. I'm in the humanities field so I wasn't worried about the philosophy side of it, but since I'm simply an avid digital media user and not a digital media scholar, I was interested to know more. In the end, I'm not sure how much I actually learned. A lot of the readings were great but the class discussion often fell short of the discussion that I expected us to have after the assigned texts. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to media theory and history. It offered insight into the evolution of media as well as our understandings of them, and asked us to critically think about how we shape these media and how they shape us. A class called the philosophy of digital media might seem rather abstract and nebulous, but it became increasingly clear that this class is highly relevant to navigating and being an active member in daily modern life. ",
            "\u00a0analyzed digital media pretty well, covered some interesting classics of media theory ",
            "\u00a0This course was truly phenomenal. I had been individually musing about the threat technology poses to humanity and how developments like artificial intelligence will affect our society as we know it. This course helped me develop the reasoning skills to know how to develop important questions to address this topic. Also the amount of readings we had the addressed a myriad of relevant topics was just perfect to incite continuous, curious discussion. I really learned how to write philosophical papers. ",
            "\u00a0From this course I gained a wealth of knowledge in the history of media theory, and certainly gained new modes and critical lenses by which I can consider mediation and digital mediation. In short, this course provided a bevy of new ways by which to think about the world. "

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Professor Peters is one of the most exciting and reliably compelling lecturers I've had. Just walks up to the front of the room and casually says the most beautiful things. The material is fascinating; the curriculum is well-paced; I learned a lot and have no real complaints.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I think the Innis reading on space, time, and power should be required rather than suggested. We returned to it often over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Peters is crazy. \r\nWeakness: Peters is crazy. \r\n\r\nBasically, the material is always fascinating, new, and important. Lectures really make you think. But ultimately, there's not a really lesson to take home at the end of the day... synthesis is on you. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were incredible, but sometimes the lectures were a little disoragnized. I loved Professor Peter's excitement and insihgt, but wish there was at times a greater level of cohesion. ",
            "\u00a0This course did well to fluctuate between old technology and new technology while relating them to the effect they had on society. One weakness this class had, however, was its inability to make clear how the information could be applied in a real-world situation. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were generally engaging and complemented lectures. A fairly demanding workload, but rewarding and well-taught. Definitely the most relevant English course I've taken in terms of subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I think the Professor needs to go back and take out a little of the conspiracy theories and add more discussion based on the texts he assigned. Some of the texts were absolutely great, but were skimmed over in class in favor of discussions about Freud (which in general suck), the Unheimlich (which was tenuous at best) and general silicon valley hating theology. Maybe it's because I was raised pretty atheist, but I find all these discussions about digital media replacing religion to be pretty circular. In my opinion, digital media doesn't replace religion. All human output is searching for answers and purposes. Just because someone comes along and wants to make Google the biggest thing ever, doesn't mean they're trying to push away god. It's SUPER hard for me to give the people in silicon valley the amount of credit that our professor and TAs do. It's really just about money. It isn't that deep. And even if you think I'm completely wrong, I still think that the class didn't live up to what it promised. It was so incredibly meta that I was leaving wondering if I had learned anything worth reporting at all after the first couple of week. And I don't hate meta, I'm incredibly interested in literary theory, and I was thrilled to talk about art preservation theory and Lerner, but I was less thrilled to talk about pussys and the Unheimlich. To be honest, that's when I tapped out of class. It was just too absurd for me. I don't know how the class was supposed to run, but in the future it would be great if we could actually delve deeper into the texts that we read and talk about other forms of new media outside of Google, \"Clouds,\" and Facebook. ",
            "\u00a0This course has some super interesting and important material for exploration. I found that looking at media through different perspectives and lenses can elucidate digital media's strengths and weaknesses. The material, in this sense, is a strength of the course overall.\r\n\r\nI found many of the weaknesses of this course in its general structure. There are two things in particular that were not conducive to a good learning environment for me. First, I thought lectures were too unorganized for my taste. Professor Peters is an encyclopedia of knowledge, which is in most cases a strength, but when it came to many of his lectures, it led him on tangents that often confused me or got me off-track from the lecture's main lesson. These tangents, while interesting, made me feel less prepared for the essays because I wasn't completely sure how all the ideas in lecture and in the readings linked together. Professor Peters wanted to emphasize that powerpoint slides are not his teaching style, which I definitely respect, but it would have been very helpful for me if each lecture began with some coverage of key concepts and basic ideas for that lecture's lesson and then perhaps a link to past lectures. After this, I feel like expanding ideas into tangents and examples would be great. It's just difficult to follow examples when you are still a bit lost on some of the ideas from the readings. When it is too disorganized, the material muddles and it makes it harder to find connections and draw conclusions of our own.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that I found needed improvement was just the testing style. For both the midterm and the final, we had a paper consisting of 6-8 pages and 8-10 pages respectively, followed immediately by an open-book timed essay exam. These are both valid ways of testing knowledge and understanding of concepts, but what bothered me about them was their proximity chronologically. They were both one right after another. As soon as I finished one essay, I immediately had to start roughly planning four essays because any of those four prompts could be assigned to me once I began the timed essay online. For me, this made me more jaded toward the material and the class, which I don't think is helpful. I felt like I wasn't really showing anything new because virtually no time had passed between one essay where I was welcomed to use as much material from the class as possible, and the other essay where I had to focus on readings for specific prompts. There wasn't much time for me to develop ideas and I was just continuing a train of thought so I could check the next thing off my list. I think just spreading these tests out a bit more would be better for students in terms of their workload and help show more progress from an essay written at the beginning of the class to an essay written at the very end. \r\n\r\nThese were my two large discrepancies with the class. Aside from that, I think the course was strong. There was a lot of interesting material, they decided to mix in literature and fictional works to illustrate ideas, which was awesome, and the professor was very knowledgeable and helpful to his students. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a wide chronological and topical range and was able to deal with most of them very successfully. One of the strengths is how, rather than go from medium to medium, each week dealt with a general subject. I felt like this gave us more leeway in making connections between media and also allowed us to apply more readings to the topic at hand. Sometimes it would be hard to distill these broad topics into focused lessons in just one or two lectures, which I would say is the only weakness of the classI wouldn't have minded spending some more time on certain topics like surveillance and algorithms. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty rambly and twisting - that was the best part of the class, but also could misfire sometimes, y'know? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: AMAZING PROFESSOR. Professor Peters is simply the nicest and most welcoming person ever. His lectures are just the right amount of information depth, and he's so humorous and inclusive (HE KNOWS EVERY STUDENT'S NAME, AND HE KNEW IT BY THE FIRST WEEK). Going to his office hours, I was never nervous and could talk to him about a range of things that all somehow related to the class but never directly. His books and opinions are so interesting. Other strengths also include sections, which were pretty laid back and nice to go to. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus highlights authors who other professors might overlook but Peters is a leader in the field who knows where it is headed. His lectures are AMAZING and he does a really good job keeping students engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong in the organization of its syllabus. The reading materials saw a steady progression in a certain thematic direction, yet had enough conceptual distance to allow a lot of room for new insights and critical thought. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness that comes to mind is the occasional overabundance of readings throughout the week. "

            "\u00a0A thousand times yes. This class doesn't just give you new things to think: it also teaches new ways of thinking, which is kind of the whole point of college. I'm personally invested in digital culture and structural concerns, so I might be more predisposed to this class than the average student, but Professor Peters' marvelous lectures would impress anyone. 10/10, highly recommend; I rate things on a bell curve centered at 5/10 so you know I don't mean that lightly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.. it's really just a wild ride and not a traditional class. Strap in, do the reading, listen to the interesting lectures and hope for the best. Grade-wise, you'll be fine. But you may not walk away \"knowing\" some great theme that you didn't before. ",
            "\u00a0I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. One of the few courses that actually changes my perspective of life and the future. Extremely interesting, interdisciplinary topics that are fundamental to ponder about, especially in our increasingly digitized age! Professors Peters is very knowledgable on a variety of topics - and a considerate person, who likes to know about your progress and include you even in class lectures. MUST TAKE. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomend this course to those students who are interested in teh role technology plays in our daily lives. I learned a lot of information that I have been able to share with my friends and tht have generated insightful conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class because I enjoyed professor Peters so much and his enthusiasm and passion for the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course lures you in with the promise of a deep historical understanding of digital media from the telegraph to AI or Snapchat, but gets caught up at Google and never finds its way from there. The professor, and some of the students tbh, seem to have a huge hard-on for hating on silicon valley and the people that live and work there. I get that Zuckerberg is pretty easy to make fun of, but at the end of the day I wanted to have deeper discussions about maybe the role of capitalism or the naturalization of certain features into our daily lives, but instead I got really strange discussions about how cats are popular online because we're scared of the vagina (backed by everyone's favorite insane sexist Mr. Freud) and a conspiracy theorist level attachment to proving that those that invested Google are trying to usurp god. The class is strange, that's for sure. My bull threshold is pretty high and there were times when even I had to put my pencil down because what the professor was saying was so absolutely absurd I knew that writing it down was a waste of time. That being said, the workload isn't awful, although it takes forever to get anything back. One book review (the best cause you have autonomy to choose your own book), one timed midterm paper, one timed final paper and one final paper that's like 12 pages (which in my opinion is sort of lame considering we had a final as well). Honestly, I'm just writing all of this because I'm super super disappointed in the direction this class took. The beginning classes were amazing and I was drawn in thinking that this would allow me to connect the literature theory I'd learned and apply it to digital media, which is huge now, but the professor really doesn't know enough about 2017 to follow through on that. Maybe if this class was taking place in the early 2000s it'd be perfect. Also, not sure how I feel about the surplus of theology. It's really not my style and it felt very very VERY much forced at some point. If they change the class structure a bit (or if you like theology and Google and hating on Facebook) then take it. If not, there has to be a more practical class on campus. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! An interesting, accessible class that I think seems niche but is actually relevant to everybody who uses digital media and exists in a digital society. ",
            "\u00a0PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE TO EXPERIENCE THE GENIUS AND GENEROSITY OF PROFESSOR JOHN PETERS. TO ENGAGE WITH STIMULATING AND VERY PERTINENT MATERIAL THAT PLAYS MORE THAN JUST ONE ROLE IN OUR LIVES. TO ACTUALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO LEARN AND DO INDEPENDENT RESEARCH INSTEAD OF BEING BOGGED DOWN BY TOO MUCH BORING MATERIAL. \r\nYOU WON'T REGRET THIS CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0Take it, no matter your major! The subject is so interesting and important, at a time when digital media are playing an ever-larger role in our lives and societies. Prof. Peters makes every lecture fun and thought-provoking and really cares about the students. The assignments are interesting, and I actually looked forward to section! Plus there's amazing reading list of books and articles and fiction, that you're going to really want to do. ",
            "\u00a0This course asks all the right questions! Peters is a well-read genius who intentionally models thinking in his lectures. It's fun just trying to keep up with his swirling yet incisive mind and all the (seemingly crazy) connections he makes. More than that, Peters demands us to ask more of digital media and the technology systems that surround us. Every lecture ended with a moral take-away or call to action. I always left feeling inspired and wanting more. Must take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. I think that media theory is a particularly important part of a liberal arts education, as it primes students to consider the world in a more post-modern tradition, and I feel that this course is a very thorough investigation into media theory. It is particularly relevant and forward thinking in that it does not simply investigate \"media\" as an abstraction, but \"digital media,\" an ever present force in the modern world. Doing so makes the course particularly relevant to the lives of students, and will continue to be relevant in the work that they do in a digitally mediated world. It is certainly a class that many students would benefit from. "
