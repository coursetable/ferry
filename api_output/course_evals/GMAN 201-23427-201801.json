            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. German environmentalism is a very cool niche topic and provides so many new perspectives on how to become more sustainable. The course made me realize the significance of changing behavior through cultural identification and pride. I learned about passive houses, biodynamic agriculture, and Germany's amazing commitment to shutting down nuclear power plants by 2022. ",
            "\u00a0Though I was already exposed to a lot of environmental issues academically, this course made me think of environmental issues in a way that I had not already done and made me address the perspective biasses I have as someone that is very aware of environmental matters, in comparison to the general public. The course also introduced me to A LOT of new and very interesting environmental projects, ideas, and influential people/ organizations that I did not previously know about, but are very relevant to my own personal interests as an environmentalist. This new knowledge also sets a very solid foundation, for anyone, to keep up with environmental news even after the course has ended and stay aware of global progress related to environmentalism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about Germany's history and present actions relative to environmental sustainability. "

            "\u00a0Strength is that the class is small and the workload is not too much and highly enjoyable. Such a pleasure to read about green German developments. Lots of room for discussion and to bring forth outside knowledge, especially when comparing the United States and Germany which at times is unfair given how far Germany is ahead. I appreciate how homework is dispersed into small assignments that make learning fun - not stressful. A major highlight was incorporating the Yale Environmental Film Festival into the homework assignments - it allowed me to engage in topics outside class time but still relevant to the course material. Lots of fun and a nice \"break\" from regular classes.\r\nWeaknesses - can't think of any ",
            "\u00a0The only serious weakness of the course was that assignments were often not clear. Due dates would change and not be conveyed ahead of time or clearly, and assignment goals were often not clear from the written instructions. The syllabus presented at the beginning of the semester was decent, so this issue could easily be improved by dedicating a small portion of class meetings to clarifying assignment ahead of time (such as a week) before they are due so that all students know what to focus on in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main thing that this course would benefit from is both more organized and in depth reading schedule.  I think we got into a place about halfway through where we'd discussed at some point already a lot of the main topics, and ran out of deeper discussions to have.  More readings from Energy Democracy, or other texts like it, would be a really interesting way to look at the higher-end policy side of things, compared to the articles on factory farming, for example.  I also really did like the articles, and I would've liked to have read more throughout the semester, rather than just the beginning--reading an article of choice at home could even be something to incorporate into the journals.  Other than the readings and what we've already talked about with the project, I think the organization of discussions and overall topics that came up at some point or another were really good, and I've gained a lot from this. ",
            "\u00a0For the first time the course was taught, it was done reasonably well in a seminar format. Everyone was able to contribute in class based on their own knowledge. Obviously there were some organizational issues due to being the first time and some problems related to interesting topics for discussion, but overall the course has the right tools. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting material. It's on being all things green is many areas and is a humanities credit. I think that is awesome! Please take this course if you're interested in environmental-related majors. It gives you a wonderful perspective on what can be achieved. The workload is very do-able and fair. Super fair grading and no-stress homework unless you procrastinate till the very end. The professor loves to hear your thoughts and facilitate discussion or pull up a cool new article to spur discussion. If you're looking for a cool, easy class - this is the one for you. While the class is a gut, it will expand your intellectual horizons so much you won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Though this course was not particularly challenging, academically, I think it is a VERY GOOD class to take to develop a holistic view of environmental issues, especially if you are not already a student engaged with environmentalism, either personally or academically/ in your career goals. For this reason, this course could be a HUGE asset to bringing general environmental awareness to the Yale community. Much like intro calculus is a staple course to fulfilling the math (QR) distributional requirement, this class feels like it fulfills the need for an environmental distributional requirement. No matter your major, this course is relevant and applicable to every student at Yale. Class discussions do not delve very technically into environmental issues and stays more in the realm of discussions of society, communities, and people, so it is a great match for people new to environmentalism. But, students more interested/ skilled in the scientific side of things can tailor the course to this through the individual assignments where you collect your own resources and create presentations, write reports, etc. on a wide variety of topics (often almost ANYTHING you want!). I would recommend this course to all my peers. ",
            "\u00a0This was an odd course for me.  I absolutely loved the topics and came out of it with a lot of different perspectives on sustainability, but it was also sometimes annoying--that one course that has some weekly assignments and the occasional reading that don't seem to have much point, and aren't particularly difficult, but still need to be done.  Nothing was particularly difficult, though, so I would say this came out with a net positive, and I would say take it if you need to fulfill a credit, or have the time and are interested in the topics.  It wasn't stressful, and I definitely did come out of it with some valuable knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Given a little more time to develop, this course would be very informative and could help people develop a broader knowledge base for understanding techniques and policies that can work around the world. "
