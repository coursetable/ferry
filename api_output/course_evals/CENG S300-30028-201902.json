            "\u00a0I learned to not be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they're \"stupid\" questions. The professor and TA are there to help you learn, not criticize it. While having already taken this course at a different institution, I learned the material in a different, and yet better, way. The Yale course was more theoretical and conceptual, while the other course was more statistical. Less numbers, more letters. ",

            "\u00a0In comparison to another summer course I took, there was less work (or equal work, but less often). I think it was better, in comparison, to take this course in person than online (which is what I originally preferred, having to commute 30 miles). There was a deeper connection between the students with each other, but also with the professor. Professor Loewenberg also was quick to adjust the syllabus (and kept it updated) as the course went along to reflect what the students were learning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the small class size made the professor very approachable and definitely helped in my understanding. Also the professor was extremely kind and helpful. The weakness was the main textbook was very complicated and seemed to confuse me rather than support the professors teachings. "

            "\u00a0I was really interested in how the majority of the students in the class were actually not chemical engineers. This is a chemical engineering course, but yet 2/9 students were actually chemical engineers. So yes, I would recommend this course to other engineers (even physics or chemists), as an elective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes mostly because of the professor, he was extremely helpful, kind, and wanted everyone to understand the concepts at hand and would work with you one on one if needed. "
