            "\u00a0Brief history of photography since 1967. Visiting artists. Photographic skills through critique. ",
            "\u00a0I think that I got a better understanding of photography after this course. I learned about how the medium worked, and I really feel like it pushed my work forward. John gave me very useful feedback  the weekly crits were definitely intense (don't take this course if you want a light workload) but they were worth it. We learned about different photographers  Arbus, Friedlander, Winogrand, while taking our own pictures. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible, one of the best I have taken at Yale. Received a ton of feedback about my own work while also broadening my perspective on photography in general. Take this course if you love photography! "

            "\u00a0Pacing of critiques was excellent, and truly pushed us to constantly produce work and explore new subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I think that John is great. Sometimes the class could be a bit disorganized, but he is a really good teacher. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very unstructured and based primarily around conversation and critique. At the beginning, I did wish that we had more critique (it kind of felt as though the class really \"started\" around the midway point) though I realize now that this foundation was fairly necessary. I don't really see how it could have been changed or improved. "

            "\u00a0Yes, John is am amazing professor! ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you are willing to put in a lot of time and work to perfecting your craft. If you aren't serious about art, then it probably isn't for you. We take a lot of photos and read a lot of literature about photography. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend taking this course. It is a big time commitment and you would want to be motivated to produce the best work that you can in order to get good feedback. Being cognizant of this fact, however, it was a great experience. "
