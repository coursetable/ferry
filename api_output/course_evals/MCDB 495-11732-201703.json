If you're serious about biology research, 10 hours a week is probably not enough to get much done, so you might as well take this class. \r\n\r\nI personally have had a great time, but it is entirely contingent on your lab. Don't take this course if you're not sure if you like your lab, and I would be hesitant to do this in a lab that you haven't previously worked in.\r\n\r\nThe out-of-lab requirements (a 10 page grant application and an oral presentation) are not so bad. The bulk of the work will be in lab. The most important thing is that you make sure your professor is happy with your work. ",
