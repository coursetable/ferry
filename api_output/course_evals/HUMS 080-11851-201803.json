            "\u00a0I learned a lot about opera from a historical, literary, and musical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the histories of different operas, how they were developed, different productions and styles, as well as the styles of individual singers and composers/librettists. This course was a very good cultural survey of opera across many different countries, languages, and time periods. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the history of opera and a closer analysis of some of the most important works ever written (and how they were shaped and influenced by literature). ",
            "\u00a0I was a completely foreign to Western opera, so I gained knowledge about opera in general. ",
            "\u00a0Transforming Literature into Opera is a wonderful course to take if you are extremely familiar with opera or just learning. The class was split between arts aficionados and those who were looking to broaden their sights. Even as someone who was extremely familiar with opera, I learned more about the role that the librettist plays in determining what an opera looks like, and how an opera is so much more than just a musical work. I also learned a lot about writing essays in a timely fashion and writing papers of some length. This is an excellent writing credit and Professor Malafronte provides you with a lot of creative freedom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about opera from a new perspective and learned to think critically about the artistic differences that naturally occur when transforming a piece of art to a new medium. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great appreciation for opera and performers and music and history ",
            "\u00a0I actually gained a lot of insight into a topic that I previously knew NOTHING about. It was also one of my first experiences of the diversity of experience that exists in the Yale community, and I got a lot of really close friends out of that. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly interesting and taught me how to appreciate opera, or any art form, at a deeper level than what is on the surface. ",
            "\u00a0This class is kind of a gut, which is great for first-years. That said, I almost feel like there could be more assignments because while it's not hard to do well at all, some kind of reflection due for a completion grade after watching each opera would give every student more engagement with the course, as well as helping them remember certain points that they wanted to discuss in class, since the class is almost wholly discussion-based. ",
            "\u00a0This class is structured well and also predictable in its schedule: we watch about one opera and read its source material each week, and then discuss in class. Professor Malafronte is also very flexible and accommodating to student interests. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really, really great class. Prof. Malafronte gets us to think critically but creates an environment where that becomes really fun - she really teaches us to love and appreciate opera to the extent where the work becomes very student-driven. However, I would appreciate more critical feedback on the work I submitted. ",
            "\u00a0It covered a great variety of operas. I loved the order and progress ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot more reading than you would think, but it all makes sense. Another weakness, the midterm paper had a confusing structure...but I guess in the end the structure didn't really matter STRENGTHS: low-key nature of class, open discussion atmosphere, TRIP TO NYC!!!, sound archive trip, watching songs in class, final project structure. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone. It was taught in a manner that made sure it was accessible to anyone, even if they had no prior knowledge of opera before enrolling in the course. It is incredibly interesting and it explores a wide range of themes beyond the operas themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone, opera-lover or not. It's a great way to either expand upon or develop knowledge of opera repertoire, which I think is important for one's cultural understanding. Additionally, this course is not hard to do well in at all, which is kind of a relief and takes the stress off so you can enjoy the opera. Plus, there is a trip to New York (paid for by Yale!) to see an opera at the Met that makes the whole class worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class moves at a comfortable pace and tackles really intriguing material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in opera and have room in your schedule, this class is great. Discussion is relaxed and the workload is small. I was a bit worried coming in as someone completely unfamiliar with opera, but Professor Malafronte is really understanding and makes the class welcome to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, and yes. One of the great things about this class is its accessibility. You don't have to be an opera singer or musician or even know anything about opera to get a lot out of it. I will say that as an opera singer/musician, it was a really cool opportunity to explore opera from a completely new perspective, which was really refreshing and fun and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great seminar. Not a ton of work. A safe place to learn and explore, even if you have no experience on the topic ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is a gut. You won't have to worry about it. But, if you put in a little bit of time, this is the type of course you'll be glad you took down the road for having actually taught you something genuinely new. "
