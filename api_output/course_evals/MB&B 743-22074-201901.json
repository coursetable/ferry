            "\u00a0It's hard exactly to describe what I learned exactly since we learned about a lot of different things. However, I would say the most important takeaway is the chemical logic thought process that was present in every lecture. I also enjoyed writing the proposal since this is an area I always strive to improve. ",

            "\u00a0The course helped me further develop knowledge into how to work/interpret experiments from RNA, the techniques involved in RNA isolation and identification. It also helped me develop skills of protein and ER stress interpretation and experiments in simple model organisms. ",

I was able to learn how to read primary literature more critically through the discussion sections. The lectures were engaging yet overwhelming at times. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: first half of course was well organized with a clear flow within and between lectures. Use of interactive questions+discussions was very effective. Weaknesses: second half of course felt pretty random at times, with lectures quickly diving into details and experiments without setting enough context for why a given problem is worth understanding deeper. Discussion papers were expected to be written within 1 page, but the content needed to satisfy the grader's demands would necessitate >1 page -- leading to points being deducted regardless. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course. The paper reading component was very valuable. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness -- the midterm was way too time restricted. It is impossible to convey meaningful thoughts and express yourself in that time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the teaching - all of the professors were very engaged with their topics. A weakness is the length of the tests. Alternatively, the tests would be fine if more time was given on the midterm like there was in the final. ",
            "\u00a0strength: the course is pretty systematic around the central dogma\r\nweakness: the course load is too much, 7 discussions in total, one term paper, and two exams. I highly suggest that there should be no exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well structured and organized, the discussion papers help a lot. Some of the result shown are pretty old, it would be good to have at least a review at the end of each lecture of where each field/results stand in the present time. ",
            "\u00a0Its a very rapid topic shift from the first half to the second half. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very good course, but the time given for the first midterm was too short ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that this course makes you think critically; you learn a lot of experimental techniques, designs.\r\n\r\nSome issues with the course is that at times it could be very overwhelming especially for students who miss some background knowledge. I found exams very challenging since it was hard for me to come up with experimental designs right in the moment. I think it will be helpful to incorporate practice problems/problem sets for students with questions similar to exam ones. This will prepare students more for exam and will give enough time for students to think deeply about topics. ",
            "\u00a0The choice of paper is good and the format of the paper discussions was good as well. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths of this paper is using a lot of previous experiment to show how people discover the pathway and teach it clearly.\r\nIt is better to have several answers in the discussion part. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Really good scope within 'eukaryotic molecular bio'. Covered a lot of important things in txn/tln control with appropriate depth. Papers for discussion were generally good. \r\nWeaknesses: There was a pretty big focus on the discovery of different factors involved in mRNA processing, translation control, etc and while this does provide a nice perspective, it can also cause somewhat dull and slow lectures sometimes.

I would recommend this course to other students simply because there is no course that focuses on the prokaryotic systems. ",
