            "\u00a0The course was organized around a series of guest lecturers, so I gained a variety of perspectives on fire ecology and management, primarily in the US. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a thorough understanding of fire science, policy, and management. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a strong foundation for fire science while also emphasizing various approaches to fire management. ",
            "\u00a0I learned from natural resource professionals that deal with fire to discuss some of the issues around forest and range fire ",
            "\u00a0I had little background in fire ecology and management prior to taking this course. I learned a lot about both. It was a valuable introduction to a field I knew little about and that is, clearly, very important for land management. ",
            "\u00a0Lots about federal fire management in the Western USA. Some about public lands fire management in other parts of the country. A wide range of guest speakers on different topics in the field of fire ecology and management brought a variety of perspectives and sensibilities to the course. Field trip was incredibly informative and useful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic concepts and ideas about fire. "

        [
            "\u00a0They aligned well. I got what I expected out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The class taught a great deal and the speakers brought in weekly were great. ",
            "\u00a0Everything aligned well with my expectations--the emphasis on outside experts as speakers was very interesting and exposed the class to a variety of topics. ",
            "\u00a0Quite well ",
            "\u00a0Well. I was hoping for an introduction to fire science and management and that is what I received. Given how little I knew about fire ecology and management entering the course, I didn't have clear expectations about specific material I hoped to focus on entering. ",
            "\u00a0The Oklahoma field trip was fantastic and far exceeded my expectations for learning, but it was only loosely connected to the course itself. As to the week-to-week class periods, I expected more on private lands, prescribed fire, agricultural fire, and non-US fire management. Got a lot of repetitive info on Western forests. The two Ucross staff members (Michelle and Charlie) were both totally wonderful, enthusiastic individuals who were highly engaged and interested in the class. I came away from the class thinking very highly of Ucross. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more than I expected about a broad range of topics. Very interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had gone more in depth in some areas. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the broad variety of speakers that visited the class. I'm very grateful for the work that the teaching team did to connect with all of the speakers and bring them in. We heard from a lot of impressive people in the world of fire ecology. The only improvement I would suggest would be to get the readings and schedule out to the class earlier. There were some weeks where I didn't have time to do the readings because they were sent out late. ",
            "\u00a0Course was a bit frontloaded and seemed to tail off toward the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: so many awesome speakers. Very important to hear their perspectives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a little bit light on the technical background info regarding forest management ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be better taught as a lecture, with occasional guest speakers, so that the content is consistently clearly delivered and builds each week in an organized fashion. It was great to have a  lot of guest speakers involved in fire management in different ways, but I found it very difficult to learn that way. I would have liked at least several weeks of hard core education about science/ lingo/ management strategies etc. before bringing in guest speakers from across the map. ",
            "\u00a0Having ONLY guest speakers was a bit difficult, because sometimes they hadn't been very well informed about what students' backgrounds were or what other class periods had covered. Occasionally the speakers were really off-the-wall, like just offering career advice or personal anecdotes instead of teaching us anything. Some discussion time (without the week's guest) could be scheduled into each class period so that we could process the information from the week before and connect it to class themes. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed getting to hear from a variety of experts in the field. Obviously the lack of a central lecturer means there is less cohesion from week to week, but that's ok. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that the course came together and it was better than nothing but poorly executed. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in any aspect of fire ecology and management. The conversations were broad and focused on much more than just forest fires. ",
            "\u00a0enjoy! It's fun! ",
            "\u00a0The course was a useful introduction to fire science broadly, but poorly organized. If you're interested in a career or jobs related to fire science and management, it's great because you're exposed to a lot of different types of careers and people in the field. But if you're just interested in an introduction to fire science and management in general, it is frustrating due to the chaos of jumping from one guest speaker to another. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely worth your time if you have any interest in US land management, since fire is a factor for almost all ecosystems. And be SURE to go on the field trip! It was great. "
