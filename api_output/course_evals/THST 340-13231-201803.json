            "\u00a0This was an AMAZING class! I gained huge insights into choreography, dance history, and modern ballet. ",
            "\u00a0understanding of ballet's place in society today, the diversity and breadth of NYCB and Ballet Now, cool first person testimonies from professional dancers I have looked up to since I was 10 ",
            "\u00a0I learned about works of the key choreographers of New York City Ballet since its founding. Each week, we had readings on a ballet by one choreographer, its source of inspiration, and its reception. We wrote reading responses each week, a midterm paper (5-7 pages) and a final paper (8-10 pages). In class, we started with a ballet warm-up, then spent the rest of the time on learning choreography from the ballet for that week. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely developed a much more comprehensive knowledge of different historical ballets as well as contemporary choreographers. We were exposed to a ton of different choreography as well as dancers and improved our own ballet vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a fun class to simultaneously learn about the history, criticism, theory, and influences of New York City Ballet, and also spend some time physically learning the choreography and delving into the artistry of each of the pieces we covered. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about New York City Ballet's repertoire and also got to learn how to dance some of the pieces. I learned to analyze dance with a more critical eye and investigate what characterizes the \"now\" of ballet. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed learning about ballet in the 21st century and how it has changed and evolved over time. Before I took this class, I had no idea how to evaluate choreography nor did I quite understand the complex thought process that goes into creating movement. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely expanded my horizons in terms of academics at Yale. Whereas the other classes I was taking this semester had strong scientific and quantitative components, it was very refreshing and rewarding to also have a humanities-based class to stretch my creativity and way of thinking in a different direction. I finished the course with much more in-depth knowledge and appreciation of the history of ballet in America and where the world of ballet is today. As someone who dances and choreographs in two extracurricular groups at Yale, it also made me more comfortable with choreography and working in styles outside my own, and inspired and stretched my creativity outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the importance of ballet in america through the lens of a professional dancer. I was exposed to variety of different styles, and I became more detailed and percise in my movements. ",
            "\u00a0Ballet technique, New York City Ballet repertory, the history and politics associated with ballet ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of the New York City Ballet and choreographers who have contributed to the artistic development and legacy of ballet as an art form. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an amazing look into the world of ballet and how it has evolved over the years. Daniel is an amazing teacher and we got to learn excerpts from many ballets that are owned by the George Balanchine Trust or other similar institutions. This may be my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the history of contemporary ballet starting with George Balanchine and working our way forward to currently working choreographers ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the historical work and contributions of famous ballet choreographers of the 20th and 21st Century and gained skills in choreography, ballet and contemporary technique, and writing about dance. "

            "\u00a0It was an AMAZING course! I would take it again and again. Ulbricht was so amazing to have as a teacher - and all of the guest artists were just amazing! A weakness is that I don't know if this course will ever be taught again, but I really think it should be! ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very personalized, very in-depth analysis of NYCB (the class was very niche), LOVED HAVING A DANCE FOR CREDIT CLASS AND YALE SHOULD OFFER MORE \r\n\r\nweaknesses: Daniel Ulbricht had never taught an academic class so some of the logistics (grading, email response-time, etc.) were difficult at times ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the balance between practical learning (choreography) with reading and writing assignments. It was also amazing to have so many guest choreographers and dancers come in to teach us choreography and talk about their professional experiences. The weakness of the course is that we didn't get much time between receiving the essay assignments and their due dates. ",
            "\u00a0It is wonderful to have a course at Yale devoted to dance, as many of the other dance-related courses are more academic and less practical. It was great to put on ballet shoes every week and know we were going to be on our feet and not too theoretical. The readings related well to what we were learning, though it might have been nice to talk a little more about our discussion posts. I especially liked the week on female choreographers, and it was nice to diversify the rep with choreography by a female. ",
            "\u00a0The guest artists were all wonderful, and that format provided some great variety while capitalizing on each dancer's expertise on different areas of choreography. The format of the class, a once-weekly studio course with weekly responses and 2 papers, was a perfectly balanced work load to keep the focus on the dancing while incorporating academic elements. The only improvement I would suggest is perhaps to create more complicated or thought-provoking issues for reading responses; often, when reading others' responses, it seemed like we all came to very similar conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great, especially given how many guests artists came to bring additional perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could honestly be improved by asking the student to write more and in greater depth about the choreography we discussed. Also, although a lot of the assignments were based on answering given questions, I think some of the assignment should've bene for students to develop their own questions about the choreography we talked about. Other than that, the course was excellent. I loved the conversations we had, all the guest artists, the articles we read, the videos we watched, and, of course, the opportunities to learn choreography! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were how it combined reading and discussion with interactive time spent dancing in the classroom. It was also valuable to have a wide array of guest teachers, each with their own styles, opinions, and wisdom to share. ",
            "\u00a0more discussion from the students ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging material, good balance of actual doing ballet and reading about/discussing ballet, great professor, amazing guest teachers\r\nWeaknesses: I wish similar courses were offered more often! ",
            "\u00a0I can think of no weaknesses. This course was incredible. The readings were really interesting and the classes were so engaging and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Every Monday I would look forward to this class. It was a breath of fresh air. And the work load was minimal to none. ",
            "\u00a0It was really cool that the class was mostly studio work and we often had guest teachers which was great for days Daniel was away but also just great to learn from other dancers in the field of ballet, theater, and choreography -- so we were able to learn about contemporary ballet through a variety of people and not just Daniel. I think we could have more discussion at the end of class talking actively about the choreography, lives of choreographers, and historical/current context. We had that but sometimes there wasn't a lot of time for a topic I think we all had a lot to say on. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are how much energy and passion the instructor brought to the course and all the amazing guest artists from NYC Ballet and across the NYC dance world. The course could be improved with more time and guidance on the papers but overall it was a really special and rewarding opportunity to be a part of this class. "

        [
            "\u00a0YES. OMG IF THIS IS OFFERED AGAIN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT!!! It's such an amazing chance to get up close and personal with today's leading dancers and choreographers from NYCB and beyond. Also, Daniel is HILARIOUS and he finishes his sentences by doing eight pirouettes! Not kidding! ",
            "\u00a0YES! so fun and learned so much about ballet! so cool that I could do something I loved in an academic setting -- YALE PLEASE OFFER MORE DANCE FOR CREDIT CLASSES ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned a lot about New York City Ballet history, its choreographers, and their ballets. It was great to learn the choreography and meet incredible artists. The workload is light, and the class is a great experience, even if it has nothing to do with your academic interests. The first class is an audition, so you have to have previous experience in ballet. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a dancer with a lot of ballet experience who is craving a dance class for credit at Yale. The level of choreography was very difficult and challenging to a less experienced dancer. The professionals brought in by Daniel were world-class dancers and choreographers, which was an amazing experience, but less to someone less familiar with the ballet world. It was great exercise and a great experience, though likely less accessible to a less trained dancer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  This was my favorite class of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If the class is taught again, I think anyone with a dance background would find this in-depth look into NYCB to be fun, fascinating, and fulfilling. The workload is very manageable - Daniel made it a point to emphasize that it should never be a stressful course (for me, it was a sixth class and a very reasonable one to add on.) Also, it is such a privilege to be able to engage with these works in this way - a lot of the works are protected by the artists' trusts, so it's a very unusual opportunity to have the freedom to dissect and learn these pieces of choreography. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if this class is offered again, I would definitely recommend it. It's not every day that you get to take a class with a principal dancer of the New York City Ballet and learn from his exceptionally talented pool of colleagues. Especially as someone who has looked up to many of these artists growing up, it was exciting and almost surreal to have the chance to learn from them. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially someone who was passionate about dance. It was a wonderful way to think critically about an art form that has brought me so much joy and peace throughout my life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in dance. ",
            "\u00a0yes if they are passionate about ballet ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if you have ballet experience! I looked forward to it every week and it was an absolutely incredible opportunity to work with some of the most prominent professional ballet dancers today, learn choreography and learn about the history and context of ballet. ",
            "\u00a0YES absolutely take it if you have any interest in dance or ballet. It will change the way you look at dance and performance! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in ballet at all definitely take this course. No question. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - best class Ive taken at Yale ever. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in a studio theater studies class, this is such a great course! It's a lot of ballet and some contemporary, with an audition in the beginning so I wouldn't say it's a class for beginners or new dancers. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if it comes back! Daniel is a wonderful instructor, artist, and person to get to meet and we had the opportunity to learn from so many different talented and accomplished artists in the dance world. "
