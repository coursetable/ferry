            "\u00a0I would definitely self-select as someone who came to the course with faint, although hardly robust, knowledge of the Algerian Revolution, and am walking away with certainly a stronger understanding of this historical moment. However, this is not a history course, and I appreciated how effectively all of our readings and discussions hinged on literary representations of the history from myriad vantage points. ",
            "\u00a0I had the opportunity to expand upon a field of study previously unknown to me. In terms of the French major, this course was a perfect counter balance to the majority Paris (or France, generally) centered courses, and offered a real look at the pains of decolonization in a non-anglophone context. ",
            "\u00a0I went in knowing nothing about the Algerian Revolution and this class was so fascinating! I learned about the country's war of independence and all the complexities that accompanied it. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my command of french, verbal, written, and reading. I also gained a new way of thinking about conflict, and historical memory in colonial situations which has impacted how I think about other subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I improved upon my French throughout the semester! I also learned how to analyze histories of conflict and anti-colonial struggle. ",
            "\u00a0a comprehensive understanding of the algeria revolution, as well as a better grasp of postcolonial french literature ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about Algeria before, during, and after its revolution from France. I also gained skills in reading, writing, and speaking in French. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of how the Algerian revolution is remembered and memorialized in both Algeria and France. I also developed skills at reading and analyzing post-colonial literature in Algeria and France. "

            "\u00a0Strengths certainly include the wide range of material covered, without ever feeling overwhelmed. We discussed testimonies, novels, manifestos, philosophies, comic books, etc. all in the name of problematizing how the War made itself manifest in literary legacies. Additionally, Professor Jarvis is incredibly warm, and her care for structuring each class does not waver at all as the semester goes on. I struggle to think of weaknesses per se; I think information and deadlines are well-communicated, and class discussion well-informed. Perhaps, to nitpick, I would say it could be frustrating when Professor Jarvis would cut off one discussion to focus on another issue, but I am also aware her insistance on these things is a byproduct of her wanting us to cover a broad range of topics in relatively short time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: introduced great authors; great practice with close reading and analysis in French\r\nWeaknesses: weekly assignments due at 8pm the night before class often discouraged proper reading considering Sunday nights are ideal for doing reading after a busy weekend; often felt pressured to speak ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is that the course is not long enough! One semester is not enough to even scrape the surface. ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths. The subject material was always relevant, and we learned something new with each week! I can't really think of weaknesses besides the reading loadit was a lot of pages each week. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a clear trajectory and tells a less known story of Algeria. It could be improved through reading that is a bit less overwhelming length-wise as well as more feedback on writing style on the weekly responses. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are wonderful, and the \"explications\" each week are very helpful in preparing for class. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you are proficient in French and remotely interested in the Algerian Revolution, or just conflict and its representation in literature, take this course. Professor Jarvis is incredibly thoughtful about structuring the course around varied manifestations of literature, and you will inevitably find a form whose content or presentation resonates. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to French speakers looking to expand their knowledge of global decolonization and its repercussions. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone uncomfortable with close textual analysis in French or otherwise lacking in high-level French language skills, as it's definitely not an introductory French literary analysis course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! It was really interesting, engaging, and fascinating! I learned so much and was challenged. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend someone take this class. It is a fascinating subject, and a language seminar is an excellent way to learn about a subject you may be unfamiliar with becasue it is a very welcoming environment (as opposed to say a junior year history seminar with many assumed prior classes). Prof Jarvis is incredibly engaged and enthusiastic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend if your French level is advanced enough, and if you're interested in anti-colonial struggles in the Francophone world. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0This is a really fun course to take if you're ready to challenge yourself with a seminar in French. The readings are incredible and the topics covered are very important. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - this course is very unique for its subject matter. "
