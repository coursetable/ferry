            "\u00a0I have a better appreciation for short stories and the power of language. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with an introduction to ethics and philosophy as they apply to Spanish short stories. I was able to improve my Spanish comprehension through my time in class as well as reading many short stories. Additionally, my writing in Spanish was improved through classes quizzes, notes, and the midterm and final papers. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to explore the canon of Spanish American short stories, with a focus on ethics. ",
            "\u00a0This course improved my ability to speak, read in, and write Spanish. It also taught me a lot about the ways in which different authors have used the short story form to communicate ethical and political messages. Additionally, I learned a lot about various authors' personal lives. ",
            "\u00a0I improved upon my spanish skills and critically thought about the meanings within short stories "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a really good quality Spanish L5 course, with a great selection of stories, a very engaging and enthusiastic professor and evenly spaced out course load. Prof. Gonzalez is a real joy to learn from. Would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course had been a bit more discussion-oriented. The professor always allowed us to make comments, but he asked few genuinely open-ended questions. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gonzlez makes this course so wonderful. His perspective and commentary on the short stories we read was fascinating and he was very open to discussing the stories in more depth / clarify complex concepts with students one on one. The stories selected were manageable to read in length and were very interesting - not stories that I had read in other Spanish courses. It could be improved by having more student interaction - having the students get to know one another a little better. ",
            "\u00a0The class's only strength was that the readings, which I eventually stopped doing because of lack of engagement with the course, were generally quite interesting.\r\n\r\nAs a language course intended to improve my skills with the language, it was abysmal. No language class, no language SEMINAR, with 12 people in it, should involve the professor speaking at us for 75 straight minutes. We were afforded absolutely 0 opportunities to discuss what we read, and I only actually learned the name of one other student in the class when she happened to run into me in a buttery. I did not immediately recognize her. ",
            "\u00a0The short stories chosen for the course were fascinating. However, the philosophy readings were very difficult. It would have been preferable to have them broken into smaller segments for each week. ",
            "\u00a0The course information was very good and interesting, but the lecture format, while interested, left me lost sometimes. The explanations were good, but it was easy to get off track "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would! Overall, it was a solid course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in improving their Spanish writing, reading and listening comprehension skills. The stories are fascinating and Professor Gonzlez leads an engaging and enjoyable class twice a week. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful class, Great survey and diverse range of authors and themes. Stories are fun and class is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This class is essentially a lecture with fewer people and not a real seminar so don't take it if you're looking for engaging back-and-forth with your peers. That said, the stories and essays are very well-chosen and looking at philosophy of language through the lens of the particular literary genre of short stories is fascinating. \r\n\r\nAlso the three quizzes are memorization-based IDs, which isn't very typical of literature classes, so think about whether this style is for you. You also have to really be on top of your stuff for the final paper because there is no built-in check-in points or anything intermediate. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not in the slightest. Although the readings were interesting, the way the course was run was entirely antithetical to the idea that world language skills, once obtained, should be used and reinforced in a classroom setting. Coming in to the semester, this class was definitely the one I was most looking forward to. Now, I am unsure if I will take another class in the Spanish department. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. The stories were fascinating, so reading them never felt too taxing. In addition, Professor Gonzalez is a fantastic instructor. However, it should be noted that the 15-page paper is an intensive task, and the philosophy readings near the beginning of the course are somewhat difficult. "
