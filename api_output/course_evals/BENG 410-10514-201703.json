I learned a lot about each imaging modality and the problem sets helped reinforce and emphasize the concepts that are important and of practical use. "

            "\u00a0There are always resources available for you to do well. Lecture is a bit dry though. ",
            "\u00a0Instructor and TF are very helpful and available with multiple problem sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well formatted: the lectures present a lot of material but are relatively focused on presenting the important concepts. The lecture notes that are posted are more comprehensive than you need to complete the problem sets and provide further details and information if you are interested in that particular imaging modality. The regular problem sets helped hone in on the topics we should review and work through the relevant equations and problem solving approaches. Professor Rothman and the TA, Muhammad, were both readily available to answer questions about the lectures, course material, and problem sets. Professor Rothman would also give helpful hints and updates on the problem sets on Canvas. "

            "\u00a0Good course. You'll learn a lot, but there is a lot of work as well. Weekly problem sets, two take-home exams, and a paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to another student. BENG 410 is a good survey course that covers the basics of MR, MRI, molecular imaging, MRS, fluorescence, electrochemical biosensing, mass spectrometry, and PET. You learn a great deal about each imaging modality. More than you really \"need\" is presented in the lectures and the lecture notes that are posted online, so you can learn more about a specific imaging modality if you like, but the problem sets are focused and reinforce the important concepts. They are regular (almost every week), and not too long or difficult, as long as you put in the time to work through the questions. Professor Rothman is always available to meet to discuss the course material and help with the problem sets, during problem sessions (held after class) or during office hours, which you can schedule with him. He is happy to help and discuss more about any of the modules. All in all, there were nine problem sets, two take-home midterms (which were long but not too difficult), and a 7-page single-spaced research proposal in the format of a NIH/NSF Technology Grant Proposal. The workload is very fair and you learn a lot of about modern bioimaging and biosensing. "
