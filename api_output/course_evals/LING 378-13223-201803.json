            "\u00a0I developed better skills in reading and understanding linguistic literature. For example, I learned how to read a paper and take away key points, as well as to work around smaller details that are less relevant to what I am interested in. Additionally, I learned how to compare the proposals and arguments made in one paper against other proposals, and how to think through the various predictions and assumptions that each proposal makes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about current research being done on syntactic analysis elements related to discourse; developed skills for analyzing primary literature and doing my own syntax projects. "

            "\u00a0The pacing and structure of the course was good. Professor Zanuttini is flexible, taking into account the interests of the class and revising assignments and deadlines so that each student gets the most out of the course. I think the reading questions added toward the end of the course were the most helpful in getting me to think through each paper we read. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course (or any seminar with Professor Zanuttini) to another student. The level of the course is definitely too high for anyone without adequate linguistic background, but if you have the background it is worthwhile and interesting to take the course. I appreciated the flexibility with which we could pursue our own interests and develop our own ideas and proposals for phenomena of interest. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a really interesting opportunity to look at research being done in syntax about categories not traditionally considered to be within the domain of syntax. I enjoyed the readings and the freedom we had to decide what topics we wanted to explore. "
