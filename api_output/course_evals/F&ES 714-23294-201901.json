After speaking with professors and classmates from the forestry program, I was under the impression that this class would be highly useful for an aspiring field forester or forest manager. I am not sure that much of what we discussed in class could apply very directly to land management.  However, as a student and professional in the natural sciences, I am thrilled that I had the chance to finally take a hydrology class and learn about groundwater flow and management. ",

            "\u00a0The assignments were very helpful but some of the instructions for homeworks involving modflow could be improved. The tutorials for modflow were very useful and clearly a lot of work was put into them, but they do need to be expanded a bit more. It's hard to find certain settings/parameters in Modelmuse and there's a lot of room for error when setting up the model site which causes more downstream errors when you run the models etc. It's also challenging because you can't easily search online for help using modflow/modelmuse. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the lectures. Jim is an incredibly interesting lecturer with a great passion for the material, and it's a blast to listen to him speak about the materials on the whole syllabus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the homeworks. I know this is an ancient and somewhat useless complaint of students, but I didn't feel that the homework really helped me too much as a hydrologist. Most of what I was doing while working on the Modflow problem sets was fighting with clunky software and trying to find a computer that would run these programs. I felt that my understanding of the concepts of the course may have been better reinforced by balancing out these problem sets by studying for an exam or writing up a case study. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main strength of the class was the way that lectures focused on theory and the homeworks were modeling based. This gave a wide base of learning and application. ",
            "\u00a0More MODFLOW work in class would help to translate the theory to practice of modeling and make the homeworks both  more accessible and more meaningful. As it was, we did theory in class and struggled with technology to get homeworks done, so often the actual purpose and result of the model was lost. ",

I especially enjoyed juxtaposing concepts with the field studies on which Dr. Saiers, Mario, and other students are working. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of exactly what it promises--it introduces students to the study of how water moves through the ground. I appreciated that Jim made the problem sets related to real-world problems that students will have to solve when we go into the professional world. This class was interesting but not mind-blowing--a good knowledge building course that is relevant for students focusing on water resource management. ",

            "\u00a0Really enjoyed the case studies we explored in class. Using MODFLOW is neat, and I respect that it can be difficult to integrate class discussion and homework modeling. I learned from both even though they at times felt disconnected. ",
            "\u00a0There's a high learning curve for the software, and I am not sure how much I will use it in the future. Instead, I liked learning the theory and looking at diagrams of groundwater movement most. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is presented in a clear,  well-organized, and digestible way. All in class MODFLOW tutorials were great, and the PDF copies were essential for doing the assignments. I liked that our learning was tested with homework assignments instead of tests and papers, however, I wish there were a few more assignments. The assignments are challenging and doing poorly on one can have a big impact on your grade. It also would have been nice to learn how to work with shapefiles in MODFLOW. ",
            "\u00a0The groundwater modeling was interesting and appropriately challenging.  There were times when the tutorials and related materials/videos could have been better organized to allow students to move/learn more quickly; this is especially true of the first modflow tutorial which took too many classes (partly because students weren't paying attention during the demonstration).  I would suggest more quick videos and students then replicating the work on their own.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed discussion of the groundwater principles, outside of modeling, but many students lacked familiarity with the fundamentals which made the lectures move slowly.  Perhaps requiring students unfamiliar with groundwater to read introductory material would allow the bulk of the lectures to move more quickly and therefore go more deeply into content. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was the combination and models and lectures. The course would have been stronger if we had more assignments and/or a group project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that there is little assigned reading, class is engaging, and the homeworks reinforced lessons we learned in class. The only weakness is I wish we went into more detail about groundwater hydrology. "
