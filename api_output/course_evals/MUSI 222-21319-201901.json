            "\u00a0I'm a pianist, and started to learn how to sing! I became aware of the variety of singing techniques that actual singers pursue daily, and I improved my collaborative and sight-reading skills on the piano while playing with multiple singers each class. I was also exposed to a lot of  awesome music I didn't know! ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of rep! Took this class as a pianist, which I highly recommend. Accompanied two singers, who each learned 6 songs, for a total of 12 songs just for the class. Lalli also encourages collaboration between students outside of class, so one of the singers and I learned some extra songs and put together a mini recital. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class as a pianist. I became more effective in collaborating with singers, learned a substantial amount of new repertoire, acquired experience in transposition, became more aware of unique musical considerations for vocal repertoire, and gained an appreciation of some famous singers. Repertoire-wise, the focus this semester was on settings of Shakespeare. Professor Lalli always chooses great themes, but this one was particularly fabulous. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an absolute pleasure, which is why I took it four times!  (The rep changes each semester, meaning it can be retaken.)  The first time I took it, I had never sung classically or in another language.  The combination of the class and the weekly coaching made it extremely achievable to learn a lot in just on semester.  By the fourth time, I was moderately experienced in opera, and was using the class as an opportunity to learn and sing more good music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much new repertoire in this course. Learning the styles and techniques and ways to approach art song was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The performance of art song. ",
            "\u00a0Students learn a large amount of repertoire over a short period, learn to work with piano accompaniments and vocal technique in a master class setting. Some music history and diction lessons as well. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater appreciation for the word of vocal music, as well as its processes and main players. "

        [
            "\u00a0Great class for everyone who wants to sing or play collaborative piano. Perhaps there could be a more comprehensive syllabus on canvas so that I don't need to keep scrolling back for old e-mails to find out what each assignment is - otherwise not much in the way of improvement! ",
            "\u00a0Great class. The inclusion of performing for classmates during class was good because it was reasonably low stakes but also forced us to stay in good shape. The inclusion of recitals as a mandatory class component was also good to give us performance practice. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very special class - an invaluable opportunity for musical and personal growth. Only weakness: sometimes Professor Lalli assigns work and then forgets about it before piling on more. Occasionally that means things get totally unmanageable without his realizing it. Most of the time, though, it's a substantial but reasonable workload. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. The entire class is only one immense strength. ",
            "\u00a0Very fun and engaging but loosely structured in a way that makes class very enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0I think the small group masterclass approach is a great one, made even better by individual vocal coachings and meetings with Prof. Lalli. I really appreciated suggestions for pieces I should think about singing, and would have been happy to accept more! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Of course - if you're an avid musician you will love this class. ",
            "\u00a0Really really recommend the class. If you want to get credit for something you'd already love to do anyway (learn lots of repertoire and get coachings on it from two different professional vocal coaches) it is a perfect fit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, positively, 100% would recommend. Professor Lalli has a knack for challenging each individual student to go just beyond the level that they think they can achieve. And then he gives everything he can to make sure you get there. You receive an incredible amount of individual attention in this class. Accordingly, be aware that this is NOT a gut!! Professor Lalli cares deeply about everyone's musical development, so he expects you to put in maximal effort. If you don't, bad things will happen. If you do, this class will be one of the best aspects of your Yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course for any singer who wants an opportunity to get one on one coachings, work with student pianists, and challenge themselves with new repertoire. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you do not take this class with Prof. Lalli you are wasting your time and money at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, certainly for someone seriously interested in vocal music or very dedicated to singing as a hobby. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It works a different part of your brain, but is equally if not more valuable than your average yale class. "
