            "\u00a0I think there could be more class engagement with having students work out the problems in class as they taught the new material. That is how muy high school math corses were and I think those were really more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class lectures would move a bit slow and there were not enough practice problems which we did independently to make lectures worthwhile. ",

            "\u00a0This course was very fast paced. It did not provide enough time to fully understand topics. ",

The weakness is that the explanation in class of certain topics could be improved and the teachers could ask the students more questions about if they understand a topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Good with office hours and being available for students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- They are very focused on complicated interpretations of theorems and I generally don't like how they don't focus on actual application. ",
            "\u00a0At first, the course was very rocky for me as the material in the book and instructed during class was very different from what we actually did during PSETs but, after a while, the difficulty in class was not lagging as much. Thus, the course became easier to manage. I think it could still continue to improve with the addition of both simple and difficult problems in order to introduce how much depth there is involved in the problems skills we gain. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- psets and webassigns are actually very helpful\r\nWeaknesses- inconsistencies between professors sometimes causes confusion, review sessions for midterms and finals were not always helpful ",
            "\u00a0It is mostly geared towards those who took the AP path in high school; thus, neglecting IB taught students. It strengths lie mostly in the professor, but I also despise textbook learning and wish the class was more in depth. ",
