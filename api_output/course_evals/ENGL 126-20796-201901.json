            "\u00a0I learned how to think of all the possible ways to interpret a poem  all it takes sometimes is choosing one strange aspect/key word in the poem, taking the idea, and running with it. I learned that poems can take on any meaning as long as we have the evidence for it. As Professor Rogers puts it, our poem analysis essays are just analytical falsifications. I can now read Emily Dickinson, Derek Walcott, Robert Pinsky, Alexander Pope, Bishop  and come up with at least one or two possible interpretations. And I have developed an appreciation for poetry, however strange and true their messages are. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to more effectively and closely analyze poetry, a form which I was not previously comfortable drawing conclusions from. ",
            "\u00a0I got an overview of English poetry, from the 18th century to the present, with a focus on a handful of poets and their distinctive poetic characteristics. I learned how to closely analyze poetic form and how it relates to the poem's content. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more deeply, specifically looking for paradoxes or ideas that seem to contradict each other yet still coexist. I also learned a lot about academic discussion, building off of my classmates' ideas while also offering a contrasting idea (and having the confidence to do so)! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze poetry quickly and effectively!! Ive learned so much about language and how much meaning you can pack into it. Language matters!! Both in essays and poetry itself. That is the most salient lesson I learned. ",
            "\u00a0This class prepares you to closely read poems and to extract the deeper meaning embedded within them. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my writing and class discussion skills. I gained many insights into close poetry analysis. "

            "\u00a0Prof Rogers was great and the papers were fun to write. I do wish we'd read a more diverse group of poets ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: So many ways to interpret poetry, you honestly cant be wrong. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Cant really tell what my classmates think about the poems weve read because not everyone participates in class. The only time I know what my more reserved classmates are thinking is when we have the essay workshop for Paper 1 and 4. I want to see how all my classmates go about interpreting a class, so it would be great if our short assignments were submitted as blog posts that we can all read, rather than just submitting to the professor his feedback. Also, it would be nice to read modern English poetry by non-white poets too  theyre also using English in beautiful ways, and I want to study them. ",
            "\u00a0My absolute favorite thing about this course was the classroom environment established by Professor Rogers. I always felt comfortable sharing my interpretationsno matter how stupid or undeveloped they soundedand I attribute that all to Rogers' teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: John Rogers is an amazing professor, the poetry we read was interesting, and I found the essays challenging in a really fulfilling way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: our poetry is too white. Period. There was one poet of color and one queer poet: the rest were straight white men. I would definitely encourage Professor Rogers to elect a more diverse poetry selection, because he can!! And there are many many poets with way more diverse perspectives to offer. In general I was just a bit confused about how he selected the syllabus. It was hard to understand sometimes why what we were reading mattered. Which made finding stakes in our arguments a bit more difficult. \r\n- the students in my class didnt always do the readings. It was hard sometimes to have really exciting discussions.\r\n- i am not sure if a final exam was necessary. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of covering a wide array of poets and poems of different forms and drawing connections between their subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great. I really benefitted from the small class size. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This is a wonderful course that really makes you view poetry in new, interesting, bizarre ways. Every class meeting is practically a conspiracy theory session among students about what a seemingly straightforward or crazy poem could potentially mean. Its fun, and it all feels low-stakes! Of course, essay-writing is always challenging, but the challenge is healthy, and you improve with each essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to a novice poetry reader. While the literature we read was at times dense and difficult to understand, I think that growing used to that struggle is necessary for anyone wanting to learn how to analyze poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  you get to read insightful, perplexing, and thought-provoking poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you love poetry or are just looking for a good writing seminar, this class was awesome! Open, free-flowing discussion, insightful ideas, and genuine intrigue from all in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student who likes poetry. If you dont like poetry, dont take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I am not an English major, but I found this course accessible, enjoyable, and enriching. I would recommend this course to anyone with the slightest interest in poetry. "
