            "\u00a0We learned about primate species and ecologies, theory-of-mind literature, evolution of cooperation literature, ape language studies, reciprocal behaviors in the wild, mental time travel capabilities, and a large range of other topics as well! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about primate cognition and the evolution of certain traits in primates. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of cool facts about primates and their social complexity. Super interesting to learn about the capacities of primates. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how ecological factors have shaped the evolution of primate intelligence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new information in a completely new field which was very interesting to me. I was also able to develop my paper writing skills, which was especially useful as I as writing semi-scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about primate intelligence and evolution, and how the study of non-human primates has shaped our knowledge of human evolution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the cognitive capabilities of primates as well as their origins. ",
            "\u00a0Difference between non-human primates and great apes, capabilities of chimpanzees, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent lectures with PowerPoints always posted before class. Writing assignments were clear and often on interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course can be disorganized at times but it is mostly interesting if you're interested in cognition, primates, or evolution at all. Professor Watts makes it interesting with videos and footage that he shot and is always open to questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are great! Readings are interesting and there aren't too many to the point that it becomes a chore to do the readings. Assignments were also well spaced-out and not difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could have been better structured, as I sometimes feel that we were jumping around. Also, we could have had more guidance for our assignments, especially the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0You have a good amount of freedom in the assignments to choose to write about the topics that interest you the most. ",
            "\u00a0I think lectures could be much more engaging. The readings were interesting, though! ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was enjoyable. Lecture was interesting and relaxing, and the workload was very doable. Professor Watts clearly has a passion for the subject, and it shows in his lectures. One negative about the course was the limited feedback we got on papers. Most of the time, feedback was simply spelling and grammatical errors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Syllabus plan is well-thought out and makes sense. Syllabus also provides lots of sources that are very helpful when looking for sources to write papers with. Feedback on the papers is extensive and provides many avenues for further research.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is no incentive to do the readings until you need to write papers, since class lectures do not actually directly discuss the readings. More connections between readings and lectures could help create more cohesion between the two. ",
            "\u00a0The information is interesting but the lectures can be dry ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is built well, you can kinda learn about whatever you want which is cool and the writing is pretty fun. "

            "\u00a0Yes - if you're interested in primatology or comparative psychology, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested at all in what the course is about, it is a fairly easy course to take and the papers are spaced out and topics are wide-ranging. The term paper definitely takes some times but it can be on any related topic you're interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fantastic 5th credit, chill class, great professor and interesting course material. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Although Professor Watts is a brilliant scholar, his lectures are not engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I think that the material was very interesting and I enjoyed the papers I wrote. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The paper assignments were really interesting and made you think ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to a student who may need a writing credit, or someone who has a lot of passion for primates. ",
            "\u00a0This is an interesting and engaging science course. If you are interested in psychology, or other people in general, I would recommend--what you learn about the primate mind helps you reflect on the human mind and clarify your ideas about our consciousness. Writing short papers really lets you engage with the material much more than an exam does. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Professor Watts is an amazing professor and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. His course does a great job at insightfully examining  comparative cognitive science. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they're looking for an easy, chill 5th class. Compared to other courses, the workload was very doable (though the final paper did take me some time to finish) and the grading was generous. The topic of primate cognition was also fascinating to learn. Overall, a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I only took this course because I needed a fourth class and wanted it to be a lecture without a section (the writing section for this is optional), so I wasn't very invested throughout the course of the semester. I'd say if you're REALLY interested in exploring the minds and behaviors of primates or if you want a chill class that won't bother you too much then take this course, but if you're not really interested in the material, then I can say you won't get that much out of the class and you'll feel like you wasted your time during the semester. And that feeling of wasted time is 100% on me for taking the class when I wasn't really interested, not necessarily a reflection of the class itself, but it is something to take into consideration. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student if this is their area of interest. Otherwise, they may not get a lot out of it. I am personally interested in primate behavior, so I am glad I took the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I enjoyed learning the material ",
            "\u00a0Good writing credit, not too hard but you will learn a lot about specific stuff involving monkeys. "
