            "\u00a0I developed the ability to use several tools from the field of electric circuitry and signals, such as a multimeter, oscilloscope, and function generator. I also began to understand how to describe and quantify values related to circuitry, such as resistance, inductance, and capacity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a wealth of knowledge on the topics of electricity and magnetism. I understand much more about circuitry and optics than I had previously, and I believe I can carry this newfound knowdge forward with me. "

        [
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was definitely introducing each part of circuitry/signals in a well-paced way, and the experiments being well structured to get the most out of each idea. Not many weaknesses within the structure of the course itself ",
            "\u00a0This course was great in that it accommodated the varying schedules of the students taking the course; A weakness is that from time to time, questions would be misunderstood and not sufficiently addressed. However, the positives of the teaching far outweighed the negatives. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you own a car or a home, or plan to in the future, you should definitely take this course. There are many practical teachings on multimeters, current, resistors, diodes, etc that are quite useful in life. "
