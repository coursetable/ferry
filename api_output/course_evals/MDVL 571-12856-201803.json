            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is that we got to work with and examine authentic examples each week from Yale's collection of what we were studying. I also found a very interesting make-up of students in the class. I think a weakness of this course was how the assignments reflected only a small part of what we were studying and also the expectations that were given for them were at times not entirely clear. "
