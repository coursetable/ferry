            "\u00a0I learned a ton about experimental design and scientific communication, and I was reminded of the humanity in science and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0345 is a seamless continuation of 344 -- continued to develop skills in common cell biology lab techniques. this year we did PCR --> bacterial transformation --> minipreps --> transfection of HeLa cells. Not anything revolutionary or new for anyone who's worked in a lab before, but good practice with the fundamentals. The more important takeaway is watching everyone give a 15-minute presentation on primary literature, and then doing your own. Presentation skills are one of the most important real-world skills one can develop in college, and 345 really cemented that for me. ",
            "\u00a0I gained greater insight into a variety of cell biology techniques as well as how to present on a scientific paper. ",
            "\u00a0As an appendage to 344L, this class helped me to think even more critically about these experimental techniques that are pivotal to the field of cellular biology. Instead of just learning about techniques, we have job talks detailing important papers being released recently and had to present them as our own. It required a level of understanding and expertise beyond what I have ever needed to know, and it stretched me to really practice figuring out a lot of things on my own instead of simply memorizing things. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught us how to think like scientists when it comes to answering research questions through the use of cell bio techniques. We also developed our teamwork skills, since the class grew very close together, and Dr. Wolenski's passion inspires us to continue being involved with research and science. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn how to be part of a team and work with others and how to be a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about lab techniques and life as a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0Cell bio lab techniques ",
            "\u00a0Similar to MCDB 344, this class taught me I how to communicate experiment results and think more critically about data. We all had to give a job talk explaining a paper as if we were the first author, which trained me to be better at reading papers, understanding the data and logic behind designing experiments, and presenting this data to an audience. Also, I learned so many lab techniques. The students in this class, Dr. Wolenski, and Don truly worked as a team to learn together, which is something unique in a STEM class. This class was so supportive and fun to attend every Monday and Wednesday. I feel a lot more confident about reading papers, research, and discussing biology concepts now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical lab techniques. My favorite part of this course was the job talk. It was very difficult but incredibly interesting to prepare for the presentation and made me feel prepared to present again in the future. The guest speakers were also a great part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to formulate experiments, how to tackle problems that scientists run across when a gel doesn't seem quite right, or cells are not showing GFP. You also learn how to give a job talk, one that comes from learning from both visitors giving job talks at Yale or event students at Yale themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that a lot of the students already have a strong background in cell biology techniques that we learned including SDS PAGE, Immunoprecipitation, tissue culture, and transfection. Thus, while we learned these techniques at a basic level, this was not where the majority of the learning happened in this course. The emphasis of this course is learning to communicate science, and that is done incredibly well through the chalk talks and job talks. I learned so much about my specific topics, loved the process of reading and researching, and really felt accomplished after the fact. I grew so much in my ability to think about the questions that other students (or colleagues and researchers) would ask, respond to questions, and think about future directions. Moreover, the guest speakers were all really incredible, in that they spoke not only about their jobs as scientists and physicians and business owners, but they also talked about their lives, their families, the decisions they made that got them to this point, and how they created for themselves a steady work-life balance. The variety of speakers present a wide range of directions to go in science for a young student studying biology, and I definitely appreciate this aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a variety of relevant cell biology experimental techniques including how to run WB, PCRs, mount and prep slides, transfect cells, and copy  plasmids. We also learned how to give job talks and got extensive practice and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this class, I learned how to give successful job talks and and good technique in scientific research. I also learned how to interpret research results. From the seminars we attended, I learned how to give successful presentation on scientific works. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me grow as a scientist more than any other course I have taken at Yale. Everything about this class stuck with me. Not just the types of experiments, but the way we approach scientific problems. This class was inherently very collaborative and our class got very close by the end of the semester. One of my main takeaways from this class is that I learned how to communicate scientific ideas (even research that wasnt mine) in a way that was clear and understandable. This class made me both a better scientist and a better person, and that is all thanks to Dr. Wolenski and our two wonderful TAs. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Community, community, community. Dr. Wolenski prioritizes the well-being of his students above almost everything else, and it really creates a positive classroom environment, which is so rare in a department--and a lab requirement within that department at that--that most people dread. He demonstrates how much he cares about his students so regularly that it's easy to take for granted, from constant offers to write rec letters to great guest speakers to lots and lots of ice cream breaks. There are no lab reports because there is a mutual understanding that there are better ways to assess one's success in lab like cooperation. The job talk was a challenging and meaningful exercise in synthesizing complicated scientific topics and being able to speak about them with expertise. On the whole, the course is designed to be low stress and high impact, which I really appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Wolenski is prone to rambling about topics both related and entirely unrelated to the course, which, although it works to foster the community I so appreciated, often made me feel like lab could've been much more efficient. In a lab that meets twice a week, that makes a relatively big difference. Additionally, and I want to be as empathetic as I can with this critique of a very well-meaning straight white man, Dr. Wolenski regularly made comments I'd consider microagressions--from glorifying hypermasculinity to exoticizing students of color to conflating addiction with criminality, these comments often made me slightly tense and uncomfortable. Dr. Wolenski is an authority figure with a great reputation (and he deserves it), but that made it difficult to speak up, which is why I'm doing so here. ",
            "\u00a0By far the biggest strength in 345 was the emphasis on presentation skills and how to communicate about science in general. Even the most technically proficient scientist or doctor won't be successful if he or she can't communicate their results and tell a story to get people behind their ideas -- this point was stressed by Wolenski and Don, and I think everyone finished 345 a much better communicator than when they started. In addition, the class was truly a family -- you make some real friendships in the 10 hours a week you spend in lab -- and I think in MCDB especially, there isn't much bonding within the major, so this was really awesome and super unexpected. Can't think of a single weakness here -- really a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0It was very clear that Prof. Wolenski really cared about us and our learning -- however at times the labs felt a little unstructured, and I think I would have appreciated to have a clearer idea what was going to be done every lab (but that is also me being inflexible). ",
            "\u00a0Again, simply no weaknesses. I enjoyed every second. I learned, I had fun, I immersed myself, I ate (a lot), and it was a joy to be there each and every day. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the best, most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale and there is not one thing I would change. The strengths include the student presentations (chalk and job talks) as well as guest speakers but the absolute best part of the class is Dr. Wolenski and his unmatched energy and passion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the lifelong memories you will make, and the weakness is that you will be so sad to leave your teachers and peers for the summer! ",
            "\u00a0This course had a great community and great teaching. I think that it could be improved by having less speakers and more experimentation. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Absolutely fantastic lab, you learn so much and have so much fun. The students get really close (ayyy gels that bind), and the guest speakers provide incredible insight as to careers in biology research, medicine and industry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Wolenski is such a supportive, engaging, funny, knowledgeable, and kind professor. He always chooses such nice and supportive TA's for this class too. The chalk talks were helpful to teach us how to present biology concepts and answer difficult questions on the spot. The labs we did were engaging and taught us important techniques, and allowed us to practice analyzing data. Dr. Wolenski also invited many guest speakers to our class (med students to talk about med school apps, dean of yale med's md/phD program, biotech people, etc). Our TA's and him also brought in so much food for us to feast on throughout the semester. We also went on such a fun and wholesome hike in Guilford to celebrate the last day of class-- it was so refreshing and was one of my favorite memories from Yale. Everyone in this class became a family and I know we will have many reunions in the future. This has been my favorite class at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0The class was structured to be informative and helpful but it a stress-free manner. I also really enjoyed most of the guest speakers, although some were better than others. For example, one (who was actually in 344,) was only relevant to pre-med students and felt like a complete waste of my time. Probably helpful to a lot of people, but not for me. It would be interesting to find someone in the fields of both biology and public health! There are a lot of people in the class (and MCDB) who are interested in both. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Again, the  highlight are the people. Dr. Wolenski, Don, and the class. Truly, I cannot express enough how important this community was to me. I felt like even just the fact that we switch up seats every so often, I got to know everyone in class by the end of it. Everyone put their all into the class yet it  never felt cut throat because this was exactly the point of the class: to show how people can do good science by collaborating. \r\n\r\nDon is absolutely incredible. Every time he talks, I feel like my motivation and inspiration for pursuing science skyrockets. I have never met someone who had so many amazing anecdotes so related to the topic at hand, from why replication crisis exists to even how individuals may come to realize medicine is for them after many decades. In class, he is always so incredibly on top of making sure the lab procedures run smoothly, and often Dr. Wolenski will be about to tell Don to get something ready, only for Don to say he already did it. I also value Don's dedication to Dr. Wolenski. I think seeing how much Dr. Wolenski had an impact on Don made me realize even more how important this class was in the future, even if at first it may seem silly  that I would ever need to know how to give a job talk or chalk talk (these skills are so transferrable!). On the last day of class, Don left us with so much to think about, and I honestly feel that as I continue in my academic journey, I will always remember the lessons I learned from him and Dr. Wolenski. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know what weaknesses I would suggest for improvement but I hope that in future years this class continues to get to funding it does so that student in it can continue to do the experimental techniques I learned and any new ones to come in the following years. Another huge strength of this class are the job talks; I don't think any class at yale has taught me such a valuable life skill and given me the amount of feedback I received in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of any weaknesses in this course, only strengths. This course emphasizes how to be a good scientist and how to effectively communicate what we know. I learned about and performed numerous techniques utilized in cell biology research. The atmosphere of the course really promoted personal growth as a scientist, especially from the constructive feedback from fellow students, Dr. Wolenski, Rene, and Don. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that all of the work we did directly helped us become better scientists. The Chalk Talks and Job Talks were very intensive to prepare for and to deliver, and probably among the hardest work Ive had to do for a science class at Yale. Feedback was received immediately on the spot, and it was always constructive. There are no lab reports that take a long time to write with little benefit to the student. Instead, all of the learning takes place in the classroom. All science labs should be like this one! The class is highly interactive and engaging. Another one of the strengths is that Dr. Wolenski brings in many diverse guest speakers that share their insight into life after college and science as it is today. We also went to two large conferences at Yale as a class, which was really wonderful. While we worked very hard in class, there was always a ton of food and festivity rewarding our efforts. The time always flew by, and it would be 6pm before we knew it. Its hard to think of a single thing that could improve about this class! ! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes--can't think of a better way to fulfill your lab requirement! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Can't really add anything else that hasn't already been said, but it should be convincing enough: Wolenski is an amazing professor, you make new friends, you become a better scientist, and you get free food. What else could you ask for. Get on that waiting list now!! ",
            "\u00a0I loved going to this class every day. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a great MCDB lab and you will have a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in biology and/or research. This class teaches you a lot of useful techniques as well as what questions to ask when it comes to answering a research question. ",
            "\u00a0DUH ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you can get in. Other labs may be more rigorous, but this one is very good. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Just know you have to email Dr. Wolenski in your first two years to get in the class (seriously, its that popular) ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Get in the lab with Wolenski and watch your class become a family. Yes, you'll spend ~10 hours in here a week, but it's 100 p worth the investment, because you'll leave with 1) improved lab skills, 2) better public speaking skills, 3) life skills, and 4) a lab family ",
            "\u00a0This has been my favorite class at Yale! You have to email Dr. Wolenski 18 months in advance because this class is that amazing and everyone wants to take it. This class is a continuation of MCDB 344 and is essentially the same class with the same people, except with a new TA. I learned so many important skills from this class while having fun. It's such a supportive learning environment and is a great way to fulfill your lab requirement for MCDB. We're in lab for about 8-10 hours per week, which can be tiring, but I loved every minute of it. Plus, we don't have that much homework outside of class, other than studying for a quiz and analyzing data now and then, so this accounts for the long hours of class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take it if you can get in! ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course if you have the time. I understand that 5 hours on Mondays and Wednesdays is a lot, but lab often ends earlier and it gets broken up by food breaks. This course really comes together, and you become a part of an incredible community of students and mentors. It really does feel like a family, and I learned so much about having a career in science as well as important skills such as communicating science. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is the best class I have taken at Yale, and the best class in MCDB by a landslide. The hours might seem a little intimidating but time flies in this course and when you are actually learning from a professor that cultivates a rich learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Dr. Wolenski is very passionate about science and his passion really brings about an atmosphere of cohesiveness to our class. Dr. Wolenski and the TAs are an amazing support system! I learned a lot of techniques in cell biology research and the speakers that we had in the class were great! Email Dr. Wolenski ASAP because there is a long wait-list to be in this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, one-million times over. This is without a doubt the best class I have taken at Yale. If you're an MCDB major, this lab outcompetes all the other labs by a long shot. It does take a considerable amount of time out of your week, but so will any of the other labs necessary for the B.S. in MCDB. "
