            "\u00a0Overview of historiography and various approaches to academic history. Introduction to popular/significant modes of doing history, how they've changed over time, important thinkers.  I learned how to think about history ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more critically about history. I learned about different approaches and schools of thought pertaining to history. It has been a very valuable survey course of history. ",
            "\u00a0This class exposed me to a lot of different perspectives with which I could consider various historical approaches and their implications. ",
            "\u00a0Great first year seminar. I liked a good overview of how history or our perspective of history was conceived ",
            "\u00a0I was able to think about history in many ways ",
            "\u00a0By taking TAH, I learned about history as a discipline and as a major. While we learned about historical events, we focused on learning about approach to history, and historical analysis, which I thought was even more valuable than studying history itself. As a non-history major, I really enjoyed taking a class about history as a whole, and the course did a good job of teaching me new perspective, and new methods of analysis that I find very valuable, and that I otherwise wouldn't have learned. ",
            "\u00a0I learned valuable things about historiography--how to think about history. This course is really unique in that it tackles historiography head-on: the readings we engage with and discussions we partake in revolve around different aspects of the field. To my knowledge, most History classes at Yale don't really give you much of a foundation in how people approach and conceive of history, so this course was really helpful in closing that epistemological gap. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about historiography, read some really interesting works that I probably wouldn't have ever come across if I didn't take this class ",
            "\u00a0I learned different approaches to analyze history ",
            "\u00a0Historiography and the many modes through which past and present historians form and organize historical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I developed ways to think about history and historians motives behind their work, and not just looking at actual historical content. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Reasonable, interesting readings. Broad areas covered in a relatively meaningful way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions weren't incredibly engaging, though that may have been more a reflection of my classmates than the professor.  Class wasn't particularly structured or interesting, very discussion-based with weak discussion ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness was that the class did not often dig deep enough into the readings and approaches as I think we could have. However, I found material to be very insightful and always worth reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class gives you a good overall foundation for considering historical methodology and historiography. We read some very interesting things, especially later in the course. I particularly liked the time we spent on microhistory and global history. Weaknesses: I struggle to criticize this because I know it came from a place of good intentions, but we really only had one essay grade for this entire semester, which was more destabilizing than it was reassuring. Additionally, I'm not sure if this was universal, but a lot of the comments I did get on my writing had much more to do with small syntax considerations than with the argument/structure/historical validity of the piece. While I learned new rules from having these things pointed out, it seemed a bit odd for this to be such a focus of the feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Loved the discussion in class about our readings \r\nWeakness: Semmel has a way of steering the conversation toward certain topics that might not be ready to discuss yet. It's a rough transitions when we jump around the readings too much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great class to get a taste of how seminars work at yale. Not much writing for a writing credit (literally like 15-2 pages)\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was really good, but I think it could have used a little more emphasis on structure. While everything we discussed was fascinating, having a more defined set of questions and topics we were attempting to focus on would have been terrific. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were Professor Semmel, whose humor and passion for the subject made class discussions engaging, and the structure of the course, which allowed us to read hotshots in the historiographical field as well as travel to the Beinecke and the YUAG. The weaknesses would be the denseness of the readings (sometimes the readings could be kind of boring) and how circular class discussions felt at times. I believe the course could have been improved if class discussions had more of a directed focus and if we could have had more opportunity to reflect on our readings through writing, rather than mere class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Semmel was amazing! Great professor for first-year students. Also, not many writing assignments which was nice\r\n\r\nWeakness: none that I can think of ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: getting to see various historical approaches \r\nWeaknesses: maybe have a few more readings that are purely historical pieces so that we can see how the different approaches to history apply to history ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of the course across many disciplines and forms of historical analysis really provides students with a deep understanding of the ways in which historians piece together moments of the pass when creating a history. The instructor is also amazing, so kind and engaging. Everyday in class was a joy. The readings were a bit heavy and could be truncated to be more manageable, but, other than that, a great course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very adaptive and flexible based on how the students responded to the readings. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Possibly! By no means a negative experience, and I think a lot is going to come down to the people in your seminar. I'm glad I took it, as a prospective history major, and feel that it was a relatively easy, informative course. Just not particularly exciting or engaging ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is lots of fun and Stuart is very easy to talk to and knowledgeable about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want a broad overview for thinking about different ways to consider what history means and its purpose. It gives you a good foundation that you can use in your future history courses if you continue taking them. If you're looking for a first-year WR course that will significantly improve your essay writing skills and give you a lot of experience with college writing, there are probably more appropriate seminars offered. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to discuss our interpretation of history and historian's perspective ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it (it may get boring at times but it's a relatively easy WR credit) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student looking to learn about history in general. It is a nice introduction to the field that teaches you skills that don't only apply to history, and is a good way of getting some writing and historical analysis experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a great first-year seminar for anyone remotely interested in the History major--or in learning a few things about our place in history and how we can understand the past that precedes us. Professor Semmel is a great professor who always makes himself available as a resource and keeps the course engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it helps you to have a more analytical approach to history ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre interested in history, absolutely, and if your looking for a writing or humanities credit, its a really solid course that wont consume you and will actually be enjoyable while youre taking it. Professor Senmel is also an amazing instructor, really makes the class the success that it is. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend. Professor Semmel really does this class justice and I looked at history in a way that I didnt realize I would be when I started out in the class. "
