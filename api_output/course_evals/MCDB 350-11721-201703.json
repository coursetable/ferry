            "\u00a0I learned how epigenetics works at a deep level and why it matters. I learned to dissect research articles on genetics and present them to a group of student scientists. ",
            "\u00a0both micro-level detail and big picture knowledge about epigenetics ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about epigenetics. I also learned how to write a News & Views paper (such as those found in scientific journals). ",
            "\u00a0This course was a bit of a letdown--- I learned the applicability of epigenetics to disease, but think the disease link was a bit too subtle throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how gene expression is controlled through epigenetic mechanisms such as imprinting, dosage compensation, and chromatin remodeling. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: great teaching--the lecture slides were detailed and the professors were good about answering any questions that we had; interesting topic; no final exam which eases up the amount of work we have at the end of the year; the quizzes were fair--no trick questions\r\n\r\nWeakness: there's no textbook, so there's not an established literature to read if you missed the info. Luckily, the professors are great about hosting office hours and answering any questions you have. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very interesting material, all 3 professors are excellent lecturers, very well organized course with good balance of lectures and paper discussion \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course can feel a bit rushed because a lot of complex material is covered in a short period of time; there are a lot of assignments throughout the semester, most of which are interesting but also make the course more time consuming than expected ",
            "\u00a0This course strikes the perfect balance with imparting content to the students while also engaging with primary literature and current research. ",
            "\u00a0The professors were lovely, but I often felt that I had trouble understanding the material presented in lecture. I felt that I needed to have the overview of the material stated at a more basic level before diving into the details. ",
            "\u00a0sometimes having 2 papers to read can be overwhelming. appreciated the quiz structure. great lecturers. the papers for the news and views are old; if students should use research prior to the date the paper is published,  that should be clearly communicated when the assignment is assigned, rather than after students have already done their research. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the course is very nice: three quizzes, a video project, and a final paper. The lectures were engaging, although I felt that some of the papers mentioned in discussion section were difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0All of the professors are great - they explain concepts clearly and make themselves available if you need extra help. The practice questions given before each quiz were helpful and lined up nicely with what would be covered/expected of you. The only problem was with discussion participation: you don't get feedback throughout the semester so it's hard to know how you're doing/if you can improve. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class was in how it was set up to have both lecture and discussion. That being said, the main weakness was how we were often assigned 2 or 3 long Cell papers to read for a discussion sections, which often led to most people not reading them at all. Since many people in the class have not had experience reading complex scientific papers, I would recommend the professors only assign one long paper or 2 short papers each week so the students can actually take the time to understand them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--last section of the course was the most engaging and related to disease. I really enjoyed the topics and wish the practical nature of the material had extended into the other sections as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses--too many papers to read for discussion, professors could have been more engaged or facilitating the discussions, quizzes often tested random and nit-picky things, highly subjective grading ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated an accompanying textbook. While I enjoyed the lectures and how up-to-date they were I would have appreciated some text that could clarify some of the slides. I have trouble digesting auditory information and prefer being able to read material to further internalize the information. "

            "\u00a0This course is a great upper level elective for MCDB seniors, very applicable to medicine and teaches you very up-to-date and pretty amazing discoveries in epigenetics that have clinical relevance. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely it is rare for underads to be offered a class on epigenetics and the professors are all invested in teaching and engaging with students. This is a very rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about epigenetics in this course, but I also learned that epigenetics and genetics in general isn't really meant for me despite it being such a hot topic in the scientific world. Take if you're interested in the nitty gritty of epigenetics! Otherwise learning the complexities of epigenetic mechanisms might be unfulfilling. The professors were all very kind and helpful, though, and the grading was fair. ",
            "\u00a0great upper level MCDB course. very interesting and very manageable workload ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great upper-level MCDB course! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in epigenetics and enjoy reading/discussing primary literature, this class is for you. Some of the topics can be dull and/or overly detailed, but they're well worth tolerating for the disease applications and more fascinating concepts you'll learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. The workload consists of about 2-3 hours of reading a week and 3 \"quizzes\" throughout the semester which is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The reviews from last year were very deceiving-- the course was really boring and the class discussions were really strained and didn't flow at all. I think the course would have been significantly more effective if it were centered strictly on discussion with 1-2 papers per week. I found the discussions really stressful and not helpful, since the professors assigned wayyy too many papers and it was clear that no one read them. Honestly, this was far from an enjoyable and relaxing upper-level course. Having three professors also did not work effectively, since there were a lot of gaps in knowledge that the professors assumed. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the contents of this course and its a nice sized senior-seminar that has both a lecture and discussion component. We critically engaged with the papers we read instead of just going through the figures like in most discussion based classes. We were made to think about how the scientific discovery featured in the paper contributed to the field, whether their methods were valid, and brainstorm future experiments. "
