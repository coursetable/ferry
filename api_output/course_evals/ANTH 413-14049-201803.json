            "\u00a0This course provided an overview of issues regarding language use and social context. The first half of the course was relatively focused on large-scale language ideologies, and the relation between language use and presumed social unity/difference. The second half of the course focused on linguistic structure and kinds of speech via a classically linguistic anthropological approach. This course helped me unite my understanding of 'language ideology' in the abstract with the more fine-grained study of speech acts and their perceived value. "

            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. It is set up to facilitate weekly discussions of the readings while you work on a final project throughout the semester. That said, it is best if you have some research topic in mind in advance, which the readings will then help you to theoretically frame. "
