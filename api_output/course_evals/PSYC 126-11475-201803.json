I developed so many skills and learned about a completely new field of study that I am now intrigued in. I will definitely be taking more psychology classes in the future. ",

            "\u00a0The main knowledge that I gained from this class was familiarity with some basic principles in the study of psychology. Prof. Hirsch grounded these basic principles within the discussion of many studies that researchers have conducted within social psychology. I'd say that the course gave me some insight into a field that I had never before explored. Skill-wise, this class taught me a new way to think about meeting people and the processes that take place during these interactions. ",

I also learned a lot about attqchment style and how that influences relationships later in life. You will learn a lot about how people interact. Both friendships, family and romantic relationships. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about apptoaching relationships consciously and putting effort into everyday interactions with other people in a way that can better not only our personal relationships but also the general social state of society. This class has provided me with the most practical knowledge in my five semesters at Yale so far. ",

We looked into how to maintain relationships and what causing strain on the relationships. Finally we examined what life is like after breakups and the end of relationships and how to rebuild oneself afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about relationship dynamics, everything from how they form to how they end. This includes romantic relationships but the class really extended to all kinds of relationships, specifically close communal relationships (we defined what that means in class). There were some intuitive things as well as some surprising things, but all of it was important to talk about. I also learned about ethical issues and how to read/analyze psychology papers, especially in the context of popular news articles (and how those articles can misrepresent the research). Another big aspect of the class was applying what we learned to the real world, so I really appreciated that explicit connection (especially using TV shows). ",

            "\u00a0Sometimes it was repetitive. that is my only critique! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the lectures: Prof. Hirsch was very engaging and made class well worth the 9 AM wake-up! At some points, the content did feel like more breadth than depth; maybe that's the point of an intro class, but it would have been better to sink our teeth into fewer concepts than glossing over a greater number. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not very engaging, I would have liked less of a lecture type class ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses were in the multiple choice of the exams. There was strong ambiguity in the wording of some of the questions which led me astray in my answering process. ",
            "\u00a0Very well designed course overall--good balance of material from lectures and the textbook, fair midterms, manageable workload. Only improvement would be to get rid of the movie activity at the end of the semester; simultaneously keeping track of what concepts we needed to exemplify, filling out 15 responses, and continuing to follow the movie to find good examples was not a great way to assess our ability to apply concepts from the course. There were only a couple clearly good examples in the movie of each concept, and there was a high chance you would miss them not because you didn't understand the concept fully, but because you would be writing another response and not paying attention to the movie when that concept was being exemplified on screen, or because you did not remember (at that moment) that the concept in question was actually on the assessment (since we were only given the list of terms when the movie began). ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it's an introductory psychology course that is probably a good and easy start to taking courses within the field or the major. The weakness is that because it's an intro course, the material is really easy and so the exams get nitpicky and the multiple choice turns into trivia. If you're good at memorizing facts and spitting them back out, then you'll do fine. This isn't a flaw of the class persay, but a flaw of intro psych courses. ",
            "\u00a0fun stuff. I wouldve liked concrete visual examples for everything, but i understand that's not entirely realistic. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was dr. Hirsch. She is absolutely amazing and very engaging. Made me actually show up to an early 9am class and pay attention. Really interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well organized and the assignments were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think there were no weaknesses to this course. I liked that lectures were very direct and that class materials and lecture slides were always provided. I also enjoyed out guest speaker and the interactive nature of the lectures. Professor Hirsch was simply fantastic. ",

            "\u00a0The lab assignments were very effective. It caused one to see the real life applications and how relationships psychologically is changing currently ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the variety of topics covered, and the different ways of learning and demonstrating knowledge that were used in the class. I liked that the work was spread among different things, like the two different kinds of homework and the exams and the movie activity. The only weakness is that I think there was less material to cover at the end so it felt a bit dry/repetitive. Also the 9am life was rough and I'm sorry for all the times I slept through class or came late -- I was more motivated than ever before to come to this class because it was so interesting but sometimes the sleep won. Overall I really enjoyed the class. Professor Hirsch was also a big strength, she was a great lecturer and clearly very knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the beginning of the course was taught very well and very engaging. I particularly liked the experiment where you had twenty students come up and demonstrate how partners usually end up having equal level of attractiveness.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the end of the course felt a bit like common sense. The textbook readings and the lectures were over topics like communication is good to maintain a relationship and intimate partner violence is bad, which isnt a revelation. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! I love how I am always excited to come to this class in the mornings, despite it being at 9am! The class is very interesting and there were times where students would be told to engage in experiment activities that would prove the concepts that have been talked about in class! ",

            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course. I highly recommend to any students deciding whether or not Psychology is the major for them. This is an introductory Psychology course and is taught that way. Great way to see if the field of study is a good fit. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you're a first year looking to learn more about psych without being super committed to taking Intro Psych. I would not recommend for an upper year student, take another psych class, many are accessible, more interesting, and less \"introductory\" while also being not that hard to jump into. ",
            "\u00a0I love the movie activity! please don't get rid of that it was so much fun and I enjoyed applying what I have learned to actual scenarios. Definitely one of the best activities I've done in a psychology class. I would recommend this class to everyone. ",

First 9am I managed to want to go to and actually payed attenyion during. Work are 2 midterms that are very fair, lab assignments most week that dont take long. Then a final movie activity where you watch a movie and have to pick out examples of things weve talked about.  TAKE THIS CLASS!!! ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I think this course was exactly what I was hoping to get out of it. Professor Hirsch was very knowledgeable and in tune with what would topics would interest us. The work load is very manageable and did not take away from the course itself. made it enjoyeable to learn the material without the pressure/ distraction of too many assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think there's a reason students are drawn to this course. The material is important and relevant to each person's life and well-being. ",
            "\u00a0Yes as it is extremely relevant to day to day life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. It was enjoyable to take. The professor was interesting and engaging. Also there were interesting guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. The lectures were interesting enough to get me to 9am lecture pretty regularly. The topics were sometimes intuitive and sometimes surprising, but overall it felt good to clarify all the processes that go on with human relationships. The class emphasized application of the knowledge to real relationships (often using TV shows which was fun). I liked that the class was structured to follow an example relationship, from attraction to breakup. However it doesn't just cover romantic relationships, all close relationships are important and were discussed. Overall this was an important and interesting class. It wasn't too much work, just enough to keep what was going on in mind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if theyre interested in relationships ",

            "\u00a0Most definitely! This is a great class to take whether you are just interested in this topic or need it to fulfill any requirements! The professor and the teaching assistants are all so kind. This class will most definitely open the students' eyes to things that they have never paid attention to! ",
