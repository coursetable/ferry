            "\u00a0Learned a whole lot about 18th century English poetry ",
            "\u00a0I learned a wealth of information about British history and poetic culture. My reading, close reading, and writing abilities were enhanced along the way. However, I got by far the most out of the final paper, my own topic developed in consultation with Prof. Kramnick. "

        [
            "\u00a0Given that this was the first time the course was taught, the class was a bit unstructured.\r\n\r\nThe material was often very interesting. Other times, we didn't have much to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Final project, Prof. Kramnick's overall seminar style\r\nWeaknesses: Syllabus- sometimes it was hard to get engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This wasn't a bad course, it just suffered from using the same approach too often. We looked at pre-1800 poetry from the lens of categorization: is it locodescriptive? or pastoral? or stuff like that. After a semester, it just felt like trying to categorize more than it did actually thinking about the works or connecting them to any more modern understanding of environmental studies, which I thought might have been a real bummer to the EVST majors in the class. It would have been really cool to add to the curriculum some modern scientific studies surrounding the topics we talked about (like grafting or cider making!) and then use those as ways to think about how we think about historical ecology. "

            "\u00a0The class was relatively interesting, if disorganized. I would recommend it, but look over the syllabus first and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. 18th century poetry can get pretty niche. \r\nThe final essay (20 pages) was long but rewarding. Working on the final essay, I realized just how extensive my knowledge of 18th century English poetry was, thanks to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course IF you get really excited by the syllabus. Otherwise you will be like I was and be unsure what to do for the final paper until two weeks before it is due. Kramnick is a strong seminar leader and overall it was a good class but make sure you're excited about all the reading. ",
            "\u00a0It was a nice senior seminar, because it was pretty relaxed and let you pursue independent interests, which I really like in a seminar. But it was a little repetitive, and if you have a quiet class like ours the 2 hours can seem pretty long. "
