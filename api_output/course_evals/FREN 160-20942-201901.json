            "\u00a0I developed my speaking skills immensely. You learn so much about french politics and culture that is so necessary for understanding current issues and themes in french society. ",
            "\u00a0Various aspects of French society and culture, interwoven with high-level skills in spoken and written French. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great immersion into French society and culture and we discussed many relevant topics including religion, politics, history, and immigration, among others. Since the class is entirely in French, my language skills improved tremendously and the class discussions were extremely enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Taking FREN 160 allowed me to get a good sense of how French society operates today and learn about the greatest issues it faces today. In addition, it greatly improved my oral French to the point of being comfortable and confident whether it be a presentation or an hour-long conversation with someone Ive never met before. "

            "\u00a0The articles and movies we interacted with were a great source of information and I truly enjoyed discussing them in class. The writing can be a bit tough at the beginning but by the end I could see how much I improved and the short essays became much easier to write. ",
            "\u00a0This course is divided into several topics that allows us to become exposed to many facets of French society. We got to read lots and lots of news articles that simultaneously improved out French language skills and enhanced our understanding of France. In short, the organization of this course is phenomenal. However, I do wish that we had more time to watch the required movies and complete longer homework assignments (i.e. at least a full weeks notice). "

            "\u00a0Yes, you gain to so much practice and your vocabulary will expand GREATLY! ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class! The workload is not light, but the class is fun and has a family-like feel to it. You will learn a lot and you'll have fun doing it. Prof. Sherak is such a warm/kind presence that she makes every class a great conversational experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course improved my french while immersing myself in intricate discussions about French culture and society. ",
            "\u00a0FREN 160 is so much work, but its so much fun. It improved my oral French so much. At the beginning of the semester, I was scared for the oral exams and I would spend hours and hours rehearsing for a 10- to 15- minute presentations. However, by the end of the semester, I was comfortably having one-on-one conversations for over an hour and giving presentations with an hour of preparation or less. FREN 160 has raised my speaking abilities to the point that I could freely communicate with a French speaker without any major issues. Importantly, I really enjoyed learning about French society. We read tons of articles, watch movies and clips, and have discussions about the French social model, policy, identity, etc. It is truly eye-opening to learn about a different culture and social organization  it gives you a sense of what things could be, and how America could learn from another society. You will learn that France is not a paradise like some people allege to be  theres a reason why the gilets jaunes movement has been going on for so long. That can be a little disheartening, but really makes you think about the deep questions  what is the best way to organize a society? How do we compare American and French cultures without being biased? Can French social models be applied to America, and vice versa? FREN 160 is the best French course Ive taken at Yale. Please please please take it! Otherwise you will regret it. "
