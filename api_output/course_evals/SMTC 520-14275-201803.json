            "\u00a0The ability to transcribe and translate cuneiform, which was a completely new skill. I also learned more about the syntax of Semitic languages in general, especially as it relates to the stems of verbs. ",

            "\u00a0I was very pleased with the course. There was a lot more information to absorb in the latter half of the semester compared to the first half, but I assume that is natural for any language. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a pretty intense language, and could be more useful to learn in smaller sections over more class sessions. Sometimes it was a lot of material to digest at once. Also, more equal homework assignments would spread out the workload and help build on skills in a more structured fashion. It was great to have a take home final though because this language is like solving a puzzle, and it aids learning rather than memorization to have more time with material and do it carefully and thoughtfully.
