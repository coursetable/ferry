            "\u00a0I learned a lot about American authors I had never heard about until then, such as James Weldon Johnson and Thomas Pynchon. I could also understand a little bit more of the American culture through the readings of those novels. Another very significant aspect for me was the learning and practice of the critical reading - that was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0How to actively read and analyze great pieces of American literature, culture, and art. ",
            "\u00a0Read texts and authors that I wouldn't have gotten around to otherwise: Moby-Dick, Philip K. Dick, etc. Learned some cool things about the history of American literature as well. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I did not learn much. We reviewed novels and poems, and analysis was limited to what the professor was searching for as a \"correct answer.\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about analyzing literature and crafting arguments and using primary and secondary sources in reference to a central text. I learned far more, however, about uniquely random and unconventional stories from the history of the texts we read. ",
            "\u00a0The peer review was really helpful in refining my writing and professor Williams also always gave good feedback. My analytical skills also improved from class discussion and close readings in class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned how to think about texts from different angles from the different assignments we had, and I especially liked the memorization assignment. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an appreciation for the breadth of American literature. I learned not only about the canonical movements and writers of the American tradition such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, but also about its outsiders and outcasts such as James Weldon Johnson and G.F. Heard who were able to use their perspective to critique it. It also further developed my interpretative and analytical skills as a reader and writer, especially in working with secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a survey of American literature from Emily Dickinson to Thomas Pynchon. I additionally learned about the evolution of literary criticism, the personal history of the writers whose works we read, and some history on book making. ",
            "\u00a0Did not really hone close reading skills but learned about texts' cultural and historical contexts, relationships between American authors ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze in a way that sounds fluid rather than my usual, choppy phrasing. "

            "\u00a0This is a pretty rigorous writing course with four papers over the semester. I feel like Prof. Williams could have structured the assignments with more straightforward close reading prompts, but of course that's just my personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0I really cannot think of a weakness of the course, I liked everything, all the readings and activities. Maybe some indication of movies related to the novels would make it even more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I love this course and always looked forward to the discussions. The reading material was engaging and insightful and the course was built around an open and humorous environment. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed each of the individual texts we read and our discussions of them, but I felt like the course could have been more structured overall with a focus toward understanding the general themes and historical progression of American literature. As it was, the class was enjoyable but didn't really add to my understanding of American literature as a subject. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a more detailed and strict syllabus would benefit everyone, teacher and student alike. ",
            "\u00a0I found the strengths to be that this course proved to be an unconventional English course, at least from my experiences. It was not so much about pre-determined conversations about passages from readings. Rather, it was about creating discussions about the literature in the context of the authors life, the messages of the work, and unnoticed technicalities of the readings. Those could also be seen as a weakness of the class, though, as I think more focused course discussions could have produced deeper understandings of the literature we read. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked discussion in this course but I think we could have looked at specific passages more often. Towards the end of the course we did this more often though which was made discussion more rich. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was definitely the selection of readings we had, but a weakness was that we didn't get to really discuss everything we had to read. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the breadth of texts that we covered. I appreciated that we did not stick only to the 'great books' of American literature, but instead went beyond them. This willingness to go beyond what one might consider to be the best works of the American canon, I think, gave a fuller insight of the tradition as a whole.\r\n\r\nAlthough I appreciated the diversity of texts, I do wish that the latter half of the course was more structured or that the syllabus made the peripatetic style of the course more explicit. I was not prepared for the amount of wandering that we seemed to do after finishing The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, which made it more difficult to see the class as a coherent entity. This lack of complete coherence could itself be a virtue, but in order for it to be such, I think that the syllabus needs to be more upfront about its wanderings. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the assigned readings for the class but thought many classes were too lecture-heavy for an English seminar. I would have preferred if students had had more opportunities to determine the trajectory of class conversations. However, the assignments for the class were thought provoking, and I thought Professor Williams provided clear and constructive feedback on papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGreat texts\r\nA couple of engaging lectures (modernism vs. post-modernism discussion was particularly interesting)\r\nTrips to Beinecke \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nMix of people pursuing English major and those who just wanted to take an introductory writing credit leads to an imparity in discussion\r\nNever really delved into themes of any text. Only discussed them in broad strokes, without ever honing in on specific passages (with the exception of poetry) ",
            "\u00a0I think my weakness was feeling behind in writing compared to everyone else. Everyone seemed to be at a higher level than me right off the bat. My strength would be that I am a quick learner and can keep up with the people in the class even though they were better at writing. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take 127. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend it! it`s informative, interesting and very fruitful. The classes are not boring at all and I think we can develop our criticar reading during this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely loved this class, Prof. Williams is wonderful and a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an English major, you have to take it, so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it or not. If you're not an English major, check out the syllabi/instructors and see if they jive with you. The instructor really affects the experience of a class like this. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course - the books and papers are very exciting and engaging, especially if you are planning to study English here. It isn't super focused or attentive to an agenda, and many classes are guided by students interests or obscurities about the previous night's reading. There is not a lot of talk about writing techniques or specific passages and language. If you're into learning a lot about the experiences of American authors through the lens of their works, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really like the course materials and Prof. Williams is really funny and smart. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who needs a writing credit or is interested in literature, it's very welcoming of all types of students, but it might be tough to get in to. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the diversity of the texts, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Williams did a good job of subverting the idea of an American canon by including both works that would be on it and ones that would probably not. Given this unconventional approach to American literature, I would caution a prospective student who is wants to read only traditional texts, but for everyone else, especially for those who have already studied the classics in high school or in another course, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student interested in American literature or in need of a writing credit. This might not be the best seminar for someone looking for a challenging, life changing English class, but the course is solid overall. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously if you're an English major you have to take the course. People more experienced in literary analysis are held back by those with less experience so people who have a strong background in literature should not take the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students specifically for my professor, but also because I found the novels we read interesting. It was also nice to be able to sit back and hear what other people thought of a reading if I did not understand it. "
