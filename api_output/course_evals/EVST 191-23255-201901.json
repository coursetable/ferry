You don't really need to do any of the readings, which is nice, and all the slides are online, which makes studying pretty straight-forward. The TFs are pretty good, and sometimes you get to walk around and look at trees, which is definitely the highlight. ",

I definitely left the course feeling I leaned at from him\r\nweaknesses: textbook was useless and it should be made clear that the text book is only a supplement to the lectures if you desire to learn more. Also, some of the homework assignments were unnecessarily tedious, such as the ones with the foldscopes which were an absolutely disaster to use. Lastly, I wished there was a bit more on actual tree identification on the course. If you want to take this course to learn how to identify many trees, then do not take it. You will only learn the basic ones. ",

Readings are trash; they also speak to people who know what the deal is about trees. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the first half of the course when we were learning the physiology of the tree. I'm not that interested in biology, but it was interesting to understand the mechanics of how a tree functions. The second half of the course felt directionless though; we jumped from discrete topics that had something to do with trees. The coverage of each topic felt cursory though, and so I rarely felt engaged in what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very difficult for a non-science student; it touches on a wide variety of concepts but never really goes in depth. As a result, without a background, it is difficult to put two and two together in many situations where additional detail is needed. This course would greatly benefit from either being about tree anatomy or the use for trees, rather than both. In its current form it felt very rushed and was less informative as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the content was pretty bland during lecture ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the lecture. I found the lecture to be very fascinating; Craig makes it pretty engaging while also being informative. Also, the discussion section was a good addition because it sort of reinforced the material from lecture and gave an avenue to delve into the curriculum in more depth; also the \"field trips\" that the discussion section went on were really nice. \r\nWhen it comes to weaknesses, I found myself not really doing the readings because I soon realized that they weren't really required for the curriculum. As much as I liked the book Life of a Leaf, I think it would be more useful to either have the readings be necessary (i.e. have quizzes on the readings) or just abandon the book altogether.\r\nOther than that, I think that this was a great class and can't really think of any further weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Broderson is a great lecturer, really cares about and loves the material.\r\nWeaknesses: textbooks were not related to the course and did not really help. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was great in that the lectures were very much in sync with the exams and quizzes which made them great tools for later reference! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: quizzes were a great opportunity to show what you know, assignments were fun and helped me remember concepts, section was helpful, exams were fair \r\nWeaknesses: lecture was WAY to long, should be 50mins instead of 70 and I felt like we only need to know 40% of what is taught in lecture. I had trouble paying attention after 30-40 mins ",
            "\u00a0The field trips are a bit useless, but are fun and interesting. The homework and quizzes aren't overly challenging and help drive home important concepts. Lecture is usually interesting, but the trek up science hill is tough sometimes. Though I really enjoyed getting to know my TF, section wasn't overly helpful. We didn't do much reading to really necessitate having a section to discuss things. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was in its interactiveness, especially through some of the assignments (such as finding the tallest/oldest trees on campus) and the discussion sections. I would have liked this class to be more interactive, with more trips outside of the classroom to learn, interact with, and talk about trees. ",
            "\u00a0We could do more with the life of a leaf book, after the first couple of weeks in section, we didn't talk about it again. There was also way too much assigned reading that you really didn't have to do. I would suggest picking less so that the students can realistically do it, and then engaging with it more. Section was sometimes fun and sometimes super irrelevant. TAs like Laura make it a much stronger course because of their enthusiasm and insane amount of knowledge. The assignments and quizzes were good, but Craig strayed from the syllabus immediately and never got back onto one, which made the work impossible to follow and keep up with. It should definitely be re-organized. And Craig is a wonderful lecturer, but you can only hear him if you sit in the first two rows. He's mic'ed already, but PLEASE Craig, PLEASE speak up. He trails off every sentence and you don't catch the tail-end. ",
            "\u00a0It was very organized and the professor was a very engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths.\r\n- Professor Brodersen and the TA's were phenomenal.\r\n- Interactive sections. the tours and practicals were a lot of fun and super helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses. \r\n-The textbook acts more as a literature review. A textbook with a more focussed attention to explanation would be better suited for this class. For instance, thoughts in the text are continuously punctuated with references to other scientific works which can be distracting. I often studied with Taiz and Zeiger which I think would be a better fit for this class (Prof. Brodersen sometimes drew content from this very book)\r\n-A consistent timeline for assignments should be created and followed. At times assignments were created and announced only a few days before they were due. \r\n- Professor Brodersen puts a lot of thought into his slides, but they can be difficult to review before an exam. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing TFs and fair exams. Weaknesses were some unnecessary field trips. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was very interesting overall but it spread itself somewhat thin so not all of the topics got as in depth as they deserve. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course should be more applicable to the environment and appeal to non-stem majors. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were interesting, but sometimes the tangents were boring. The information could have been given more succinctly. ",
            "\u00a0Not many weaknesses, the course offers a great in-depth and varied look into the material. The course was well organized and assignments were all transparent and fair. ",
            "\u00a0There was (though I think they tried to fix this) a huge gap in what we were expected to know in section/quizzes/homework and what we actually had to know for the exam. This made the class and the grading system really difficult to grasp because we were harshly graded on midterms and not on anything else. The multiple choice questions were kinda weird. Craig said he wrote tests by looking at the lectures and writing questions based on the slides, but it definitely didn't seem that way for some of the multiple choice on the exam. Section was also kinda weird because (even though I loved my TA) no section was alike, and we never knew what to expect, which made it hard to learn and relate section material with what we learned in lecture. The TAs are really great and so helpful in office hours and review sessions, so that out of class time was really essential to my understanding of the material. I think it would be great if lectures were posted ahead of time so we could look through the slides and know what information we had to look out for or had questions about. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to cast its net pretty broadly, because it has students of all skill/interest/engagement levels. It has to be accessible without completely sacrificing intellectual rigor; it has to teach important ecological principles without losing the interest of people who don't much care about ecology. I think it makes the right compromises. ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized well and students are evaluated in a variety of ways (quizzes, assignments, exams), which is nice. The lectures are generally interesting and easy to follow. The furniture study visit is a highlight.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course: I think the instrument study visit felt disorganized. I also wish we learned more about climate change and less about the commercial uses of wood. Also, some of my classmates in other sections and I noticed that our exams were graded slightly differently (some people lost points on things that others didnt), so it might be helpful to create a more decisive rubric in future semesters. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Got to go outside often. Exceptional TF's. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too long of lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: some of the topics are interesting and the content is approachable in lecture\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are sometimes boring, sections are not helpful, the grading is extremely and unnecessarily harsh, there is a huge difference between the lecture (and how professor Brodersen portrays the course to students) and the TAs' standards for the students when they grade texts\r\nThe course is not a gut. Seems easy and interesting, but grading is absurd. ",
            "\u00a0The class should be 50 minutes rather than an hour and 15 minutes. I definitely think there was a lot of excessive and insignificant material covered that, if removed, would make a 50 minute class very doable. ",
            "\u00a0Craig is an awesome lecturer and I loved this class. Sometimes the lectures can certainly drag, and the tests involved, especially at first, a lot of regurgitation, though the final really highlighted conceptual understanding, which I appreciated. Some of the homework felt like busywork. Maybe would be better as a 50 minute class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great professor, really interesting content, nice and knowledgeable TAs\r\ncan't think of weaknesses it was overall just a really good course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the hands-on activities in section and the assignments that required us to go out and find certain things, which helped me engage in the class material. Our section field trips were a particular favorite of mine. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyed section, always seemed to be interesting. Lecture could sometimes be tough to sit through, and I feel like my engagement would have been higher had the class been an hour. ",
            "\u00a0Well formatted exams. Good TFs ",
            "\u00a0I thought the online quizzes were a good assessment. Most of the section assignments were good, though I found the Fibonacci sequence assignment a little bit unnecessary (though I think this is something that could be fixed by doing it a different way rather than eliminating it. I liked having learned about this and seen it in real life once we started learning about auxin). The lectures were interesting and the TFs great. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assignments took too much time for the small number of points they counted for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the lectures and assignments are really fun. The first test was very hard but they feel really fair if you study for them. For me (very little background in science) this class was NOT a gut, but it was challenging in a fun and fair way. Professor Brodersen is so cool. ",
            "\u00a0It is a super interesting course (though I am personally biased because I love tress.) However it does tend to move in fits of difficulty- some classes I was writing ridiculously fast and absorbing lots of material, and others went at a much slower pace. Obviously some themes are more difficult or more information-heavy than others, but I still think the material could be divided more evenly. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved my discussion section and my TA. She really contributed to my success in this class. I loved how discussion sections were not boring, but in fact, eye-opening! The weakness, however, would be the lectures, which were not as engaging as I hoped it would be. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - cool field trips, section is very helpful, material is taught in cool and clear topics/lessons\r\n\r\nweaknesses - class was too long and hard to stay focused, so I'd recommend shortening if possible, also exams seemed way to detailed and picky in grading...I understood so much of the broader topics and attended every lecture but 1, and studied the details, but I felt the exams were designed for people who simply memorized slide/textbook info "

Also the sections feel like being a kindergartner - including looking at musical instruments and tracing and cutting leaves. But the exams actually require work to do well on. Everything seems upside down in this class. ",

As a non-STEM person, I was really hoping it would be a fun class in which I could learn some fun tree facts, do some worksheets, and not have to study for examinations (just being honest). This was not my experience. Trees is NOT a gut. While there is definitely not a big workload, the exams are not easy. I attended every lecture and discussion section throughout the semester and thought that because this class was advertised as a gut, that just going to lecture and section would be enough. I was dead wrong. I think this class is super chill for STEM people, but if youre literally anything else (even if youre a FOOT leader/Yale Outdoors person), I really doubt youll find this class interesting. There is a very small emphasis on topics that are relevant to non-STEM people (one lecture has a section on accessible climate change information, but thats it). Because lecture was really not great, it made it difficult to find the material interesting and enjoy studying for exams. Im going to be honest: Im a vegetarian; Im a FOOT leader; I self-identify as a tree-hugger. But, after taking this class, I kind of despise trees. Im going to include some quotations from my semester in trees that really sum up my feelings about this class:\r\nBecause of trees, Im going to use fossil fuels for fun.\r\nI can put in a thimble what I know about trees.\r\nI hate their smug trunks.\r\nTL;DR- dont take this class as your science gut. Find something else. An A or an A- is not guaranteed. If youre a STEM person, sure; youll probably enjoy the material. Thats how I feel about trees- thats my story, and Im sticking to it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Craig is an amazing professor. He is amazing at taking science topics which use big, esoteric words and explaining them in lay terms so that everyone can understand. There are some admittedly boring parts of the class (extensively talking about plant hormones and having to memorize where each one is synthesized in a plant and such), but overall, this class puts forth some amazing concepts that really enhance your understanding of the natural world around you. If you get into it, you will really be able to glean a lot from it; if you're not that into it, you can probably still do well, but you should ask yourself why you're taking it at all. ",

If you are looking for a gut, then this is probably not the right course for you. I wouldn't say the course is particularly hard but it does require a good of studying for exams and effort on HW. ",

            "\u00a0yes; if you need a science credit, go for it. It's only a gut for some people; don't rely on that. Gut has to be defined very loosely in this case. It's really cool stuff though. ",
            "\u00a0Yup! Take the class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if youre into EVST or trees. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great science course, especially for non-STEM majors! Learned a lot about trees in an accessible, yet still relatively rigorous, way. The TAs are also highly invested in the teaching process and wish to make it an enjoyable experience for all. Love how many connections I can now make between trees, my other academic interests, and daily life in general. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in trees and want to make an effort to find value in the material, then yes do it. At times it takes a lot of effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they already had a background in biology / were incredibly interested in learning about trees or horticulture/forestry. Otherwise, I felt as thought it was fairly shallow while also quite difficult (coming from a non-stem field). As a result, I don't think I would recommend the course to anyone outside of those parameters. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to gain a basic understanding of how trees function and just learn a bunch of cool facts about these organisms that most people take for granted. This class definitely gave me an appreciation for trees that I've never had before, in that I now realize that they are infinitely more complex than I ever expected them to be. This class is a must-take for anyone who is into forestry, the environment, or has an interest in plant biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This is a great introductory course or for those with little background in ecological studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting to learn about trees ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great way to get a science credit while also learning a lot about trees and how they can help solve climate issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want to learn more about trees, their biology (more so than tree identification), and how they interact with the world around them. ",
            "\u00a0If you're willing to put in the work, yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone is looking for a science credit that is NOT a gut. The quizzes and assignments may fool you, but the tests are very difficult and require a lot of preparation to do well. Sit closer to the front so you can hear Craig. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. There's a lot of support from the TAs and the courseload hits the right balance of challenge and engagement, whilst making sure you're not overwhelmed in the learning process. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it is an easy, enjoyable science credit. ",
            "\u00a0100%, a great class to learn more about trees or get involved in the sciences in an approachable way. ",
            "\u00a0No because it was pitched as a class for non science majors but got very scientifically technique in a way that made learning about trees dull and at times confusing ",
            "\u00a0I guess so. I mean it's an okay science credit, and you learn a lot. It's not super difficult information, the testing style was just weird and unpredictable. You have to really be willing to put the work in though. There is a lot of memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a non-science major looking for a science credit, this is a great option. The class isnt incredibly easy, and it requires a fair amount of evenly-distributed work throughout the semester, but Ive already noticed how the material I learned in this class informs my understanding of the nature around me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Especially if the student is not an EVST major, the course gives you an in depth, fresh perspective on the environment and humans' impact. This is literally our future, so learn about it. ",
            "\u00a0not really worth taking as not a stem student. the TFs were horrible. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course unless you are really into trees AND BIOLOGY. If you are thinking of taking the course because it seems like an interesting science class that can be accessible to you as someone who does not like science, do not be fooled: the TAs expect you to know a lot about physics and biology, and some chemistry. Much of the content in this sense, will not seem relevant to you if you are not a scientist, and just care to learn about trees in a broader scale. ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0No, the tests are way harder than expected. Even from study guide ",
            "\u00a0I thought the information presented in the class was interesting and accessible. Craig is such a wonderful professor and is so invested in his students as well as the subject matter. If you show up to lecture and take notes, the exams aren't difficult at all. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Not a gut. Not extremely challenging either, but definitely not a gut. A fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! But don't assume it's a gut, you need to pay attention, come to class, take notes, etc. I really loved the subject. I'd say don't take it if you have zero interest in trees. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great class. Particularly, it is a great science credit for non-science majors. Although, I must say, and I must say loudly, that this is not a gut. I took the class knowing this, but there were murmurs that this class would be very easy. This is not true. It requires a good deal of work and has a workload very much comparable to any other Yale course. I highly recommend that you take it though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very well integrated class that is exciting for a science requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Gives an interesting real world spin on statistics ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student looking for a science credit. I would not recommend this class to a student who is looking to major in a science (aside from maybe the EVST B.A.) because a lot of this information will be a lower-level repeat of things they will come across later. I thought that Craig was a good lecturer and his slides were detailed enough that it is possible to not go to class and still keep up (though sometimes he gives extra credit to people who attend lecture). The TFs are good. I don't think this class is a complete gut - I was taking this class along with some other easy classes and probably ended up studying for the Trees tests the most, but it still wasn't terrible. Just don't expect to do nothing for the class. ",
            "\u00a0not really, no. it might make you dislike looking at trees because you'll remember how necessarily stressful this class can be at times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great science credit that helps you get outside and get to know the School of Forestry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was informative and not too complex for a non-stem person such as myself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students, but those who are looking for a \"gut\" class, this may not be the best choice! (Are guts even real here at Yale?) This is a class that you MUST put work in in order to get a good grade (the class average for the first midterm was a C... ",
            "\u00a0YES!! It is a lot of detail, but it is so much fun to learn how plants actually work and understand the relationship and similarities we have with them. the field trips are cool and the TAs are all super cool and helpful! Be prepared for constant quizzes, though. "
