The lectures were very detailed, so we learned a lot about different disorders, how they are diagnosed and treated, as well as the etiology and risk factors associated with each one. I also feel like I gained skills in regards to reading research papers and learning when to consider the methodology of a study and whether or not it is generalizable to all/certain populations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about different kinds of criminals, why they act the way they do, and what we can do to help them. It was super interesting, informative, and fun. ",

I learned a fair amount about the human brain, but the majority of the course was a summary of Professor Baskin-Sommers' own research. ",

While I am not a psychology person, my biggest take away was that psychopathy is actually a very specific disorder and for those of us outside the field we should be careful to label people as psychopaths because it is a very specific disorder. ",

Very interesting lectures, but I wish there could've been even more lectures at the end of the course about the bigger applicability of the knowledge on policy. I think many of the students taking the course may not be psych majors, but that's an even better reason for people who may be future policymakers or future researchers, etc. to not only understand the mechanisms, but how all of this knowledge should inform prison reform and larger policy reforms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much by taking this course. I learned about the distinctions between psychopathy and externalizing, other mental illnesses, and conduct disorder and callous unemotional traits. I gained a lot of insight into how those who are mentally ill think, behave, and act. ",

I also realized that a large problem with America's criminal justice system is its inability to use this research in providing treatment or punishment for crimes. ",

This course has given me the knowledge to decipher not only what each of these clinical diagnoses means, but how specific criminal behaviors boil to the surface through a combination of genetic, environmental, and neural factors. This course is incredibly comprehensive, looking at the psychological underpinnings of crime from childhood all the way through adulthood. ",

            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned skepticism for given methodologies, conclusions, and assumptions when it comes to \"accepted\" psychological and psychiatric research. I learned about the nuance of people's disorders and multiple ways their etiologies could differ and interact with environment, genes, and neurology. I learned that the current treatment set-up of the already dysfunctional criminal justice system is just as dysfunctional, and is in dire need of change. ",

Perhaps it would have been helpful if less readings were assigned per class (maybe just 1 or 2 smaller parts of different papers) because I often did not find reading the entirety of them to be helpful and it takes much longer to get through scientific papers than anything else.

            "\u00a0Dr. Baskin-Sommers is INCREDIBLE! Like hands down one of the most engaging, dynamic professors I've had at Yale. She's the kind've person who makes you feel smarter simply by being in her presence but who you'd also want to grab a beer with. I'm not sure if its because she's relatively young and therefore can make references that are topical and relevant or because she makes a concerted effort to understand where we're coming from, or a combination of both - probably both - but she's amazing. She really goes out of her way to connect with students and know our names - even in a huge lecture. It's clear that she genuinely cares and actually wants us to learn the material. Instead of simply expecting us to regurgitate information, she makes sure that we're engaged in the material from playing relevant songs on Spotify before class to showing video clips of movies and tv shows we're familiar with as examples in class. The course was also extremely well-organized and everyone always knew what to expect - the study guides and paper prompts were posted on Canvas from the first day of class and nothing changed. It was nice to know exactly what was expected of us. Importantly, Dr. Baskin-Sommers PERSONALLY responded to all questions posted online literally within the hour. I'm not sure how she did it but it was wild. This course really didn't have any weakness that doesn't characterize lectures generally. More specifically, I'd say that I wish there were more opportunities to engage in discussions with tfs and/or the professor about the material. But that's hard to do in a huge lecture especially one without a section. ",
            "\u00a0For anybody interested in psychology or neuroscience, this is a great course. I am not interested in those fields, but I still found the course remarkably well-designed. The class is not so much focused on criminal policy and law, which I thought it was; it is very much focused on the research trying to understand the minds of psychopaths, externalizers, kids with Conduct Disorder, etc., and we only really had one class about how that research can and should shape policy and law. We spent a lot of time with the nitty gritty psychology studies, and all the readings are basically studies. Therefore, I think the course should start with a little introduction teaching people in the class with no psychology background how to understand studies. Overall, Professor Baskin-Sommers is really trying to help you learn and succeed in the class. ",

I liked that a summary slide was included at the end of each lecture because this helped refresh the main points. Also, I really liked that a study guide was given out before each exam that clearly dictated what to study, as this helped reduce my study time and helped me score highly on the exams. I also found each review session to be very helpful, and I liked that we emailed our questions to the TFs ahead of time so that they could go over each question in the review. I also found Piazza to be an amazing resource throughout the course; questions were answered almost immediately and in great detail, which was very helpful in preparing for the exams and writing the essays. Also, all of the slides and lecture notes were posted on Canvas, which was very helpful if I needed to fill in my notes later on. Finally, we were given able time to prepare for the exams and write the essays, which was really nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe slides used in lecture were often a bit too wordy and distracting; often times, the professor would explain what was on the slides or provide info that was not on screen, which I would often miss if I got too distracted copying the slides. In the future, it might be a good idea for the professor to post the slides after the lecture so students can still fill in their notes, and simply talk during lecture so that students are focused on what the professor has to say in class. Also, essay instructions were often vague and a bit unclear; I think better rubrics with more detailed instructions could have been provided. It was often unclear when and if we should pull in outside information, and how to do so. ",

Very organized, always knew what to expect coming into class everyday.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of articles to cover every day the class met.  \r\nImprovements: Adding weekly homework assignments that analyze the assigned articles to force us to actually read the studies, since they are very helpful in grasping the concepts for test once they are read thoroughly.

I had been thinking about it for a while, but this s what sealed the deal. For non-psych majors, I think the material is super interesting and approachable, largely due to Prof B-S's teaching. A really cool class taught by an awesome person. I've never had such an invested, helpful teacher that truly meets people where they're at. She really wants everyone to succeed. If you have room for this in your schedule, definitely consider this class. ",

The class asks you to pay more attention to properly diagnosing disorders or other behaviors in people, and asks you to take a more critical eye in the portrayal of 'crazy people' in the media, pop culture, and entertainment. I've taken away a lot of knowledge that changes how I see the world. ",
