Dr. Bennet is the best professor I have had at Yale so far. Exams are somewhat challenging, but if you invest the time to really learn the material, they are manageable. The only thing I would improve would be reducing the class size, but it didn't significantly impede my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Very relevant to physics! Take this over Phys301 or Math246. I found it fascinating and easier to understand. Far more focused on problem solving and quickly relevant in physics classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well structured. Assignments matched the lecture material and the written lecture notes were fantastic. The course does cover a lot of material and that can be daunting at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by having review sessions before the exams and having practice exams. We only did problems from the textbook on homework so it was really difficult to understand the exam problems. ",

            "\u00a0The class was structured around being given a very specific type of differential equation and memorizing the process to solve that equation. There was no context given in terms of geometrically or algebraically explaining what the differential equations looked like or we were doing in the process of solving them. The \"application\" sections, too, were very monotonous and not broadly applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Despite having to cover a huge amount of material, the class was well organized and well taught. Professor Bennett did a great job making some of the more complicated math accessible to everybody, and the lecture notes she provided after every class are better even than the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Beth is an incredible teacher and probably the only person I could learn differential equations from. Her notes were precise and I learned from them so well, and her lectures were very clear. It's a class with a lot of very very smart people, so I wish there was a little more wiggle room in terms of grades - possibly three midterms with one dropped midterm, or you could take the final grade in the place of one midterm. In the end, I feel like I mastered the material (good grades on the finals) but didn't get a good overall grade because of one midterm that I thought was challenging, which is a little frustrating. The psets were reasonable and the final was challenging but not too ridiculous. I wish we spent more time on PDE's - if we had done the beginning few concepts in the course faster (they were pretty easy to understand) perhaps we could have! Wish there was more midterm practice material but otherwise a very good course. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves super fast because it covers ordinary and some partial differential equations, but I guess since it's meant for engineers it's better to combine all you need into one semester. The biggest strength is Beth Anne Bennett teaching this class, it could be improved by having her teach it forever. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most organized course I've every taken at Yale! Dr. Bennett posts very clear expectations, lecture notes, handouts, problem sets, problem set solutions, and other resources well in advance. The content can be boring and confusing at first, but this course is extremely well structured for student learning. ",
            "\u00a0Beth Anne is amazing, without a doubt the best math professor I've had at Yale. She takes the time to work through multiple examples in class, which helps make the application of the methods so much more clear. The main weakness of the course was the way in which PDEs were only really touched in the last weak or two, so it was very rushed. I would suggest either getting to it earlier in the course or taking it out entirely so the class is only ordinary differential equations ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths, including the instructor Beth Anne V. Bennett. However, since I am reviewing the course itself and not the professor, I will talk more about the course. The course material is a little fast in the beginning, then it gets slower as the curriculum expands more generally to nth-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's), and then picks back up again when you introduce the other concepts such as Laplace transformations, partial differential equations, series solutions, and Laplace's equations. One weakness of the course was the lack of stress of the conditions required to use each method: such as when to use integrating factors, Laplace's transformations, Method of Undetermined Coefficients, etc. Although I eventually learned these conditions, I had to spend many hours learning the different conditions. Also, another weakness is the lack of time spent on Partial Differential Equations (PDE's). Although Beth Anne V. Bennett said in the first lecture that we will only spend two weeks or so on PDE's, it was still a crunch for time in the end (you have to spend a lot of time solving just one problem). One other weakness is the fact that there are many problems that take a long time to do, and every test is a crunch for time (it really test how fast you can do each problem... occasionally I would get bored during the problem and work on another problem haha). FINALLY, you have to know at least some Linear Algebra, or at least know some matrix-based operations (Beth Anne V. Bennett was kind enough to do an optional review session at a separate time from lecture which covered everything we needed to know for the class). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bennett is an excellent lecturer. She is great at explaining concepts, extraordinarily organized, and very considerate of her students. The PSETs werent particularly time consuming, and fairly typical for what you would expect from a math course. The support for this class was subpar however. The TAs were not particularly helpful and office hours with Professor Bennett often were really full. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures were incredibly clear and thorough. Notes were posted online for every lecture; these notes were also very thorough. The homework is good practice, and the answers are in the back of the book (Dr. Bennett knows this), so doing the homework and checking the answers is a great way to solidify one's knowledge of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The course was graded very harshly, and the midterm exams were very difficult, beyond the scope of what was learned in class. Only about 15-18 people out of 82 earn an A, and many earn a C or worse. The TA's this year were not very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class shouldn't include partial diff EQ. There is enough content without it and you don't get to understand it conceptually in the time we spend studying it. We just get equations without physical understanding, which is only slightly valuable. Beth Ann Bennet is incredible. Probably the best lecturer and professor I have had in a STEM class at Yale. She really cares about her students and spends so much time preparing for class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very fast, which is both a strength and a weakness as it takes practice to master all the methods and use them efficiently to solve problems in a timely manner. Sometimes it may go so fast that people get lost and its sometimes tough to catch up once you are behind, as all the material is cumulative. However, professor Bennett explains things really well and works with everyone to make sure everyone understands the material so its well taught and its not too tough to follow along and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very well organized\r\nNot too much to say about an applied math course, it is what it is. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice to learn slightly more about PDEs - they seemed like a bit of an afterthought in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very good and I generally feel that they helped me learn the material.  The problem sets are related, although occasionally felt needlessly long. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that is taught very well and a lot of material is covered with practical applications to keep engineering majors interested.  The weakness is that it is a lot of work.  To some extent, this is expected, as it is not easy material.  However, I believe that the problem sets could be a bit shorter and we would still have learned the subject well. ",
            "\u00a0By the end I feel PDEs were crammed and we were told to read the lecture notes/textbook in addition to going overtime for classes in order to learn all the material, when I think it would've been better just not to learn the last few sections. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was fantastic. This includes both the lectures and the lecture notes which were incredibly easy to follow and read from. The only real weakness is the fact that some of the last homeworks were incredibly long, hard and time consuming, like absurdly hard. For these homework assignments it was less about understanding the material and more about writing out three pages of summations or pages containing the solution of just one hard to solve integral. These were unnecessary and I hope this gets changed for future years. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bennett was fantastic, but could not prevent diff eqs for being a relatively uninteresting subject. That's an impossible task. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nI would say this course is true to its word: I did feel far more equipped to handle differential equations than when I went in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIf one takes this class at face value (i.e. ENAS, NOT proof-based math), I would say weaknesses are few and far between under Professor Bennet. Theres a lot of material, but we got through it in an organized and comprehensive manner. ",
            "\u00a0Beth is an amazing professor who manages to go through A LOT of material very quickly - while explaining all of this material in a very straightforward and simple way. She is extremely good at \"dumbing down\" what could have otherwise been a very difficult and complicated subject.\r\nThe lectures notes posted online and extremely helpful and well structured. \r\nThe problem sets, while long, are pretty fun to do!\r\nThe material is challenging - in a good way - and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this class was the long and hard exams - especially the first midterm, which was very difficult and stressful to do. It was the type of exam that you feel like crap afterwards, even if you were extremely well prepared. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite comprehensive, but leaves too little time for the last portion class (partial differentials). It is timed such that much of the last portion is covered very quickly and many smaller topics need to be self taught. I liked that the course focused far more on applications rather than Theory. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught very well, but the grading distribution was unfortunate. Since the tests were difficult, only a certain number of people got A's, B's, etc. If you had prior knowledge of linear algebra, there was a very unfair advantage on the second midterm thus causing a bit of discrepancy in the grades. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong and clear format. I dont think partial differential equations should be covered. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bennett is a wonderful professor and is committed to helping the students understand the material! ",
            "\u00a0Diff eqs are inherently sort of a dry subject, but for what it was, the course was pretty educational. Not fun really, but I didn't expect it to be. Not sure how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It taught exactly what the course title says\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very rushed class (too much content for 13 weeks), stressful class by nature of the grading/content/psets ",
            "\u00a0This course was VERY well organized (all thanks to Professor Bennett I expect). The psets were fair and not too hard to work through on your own. The lectures weren't very engaging but they certainly taught the material well, and were very clear. The exams I found to be challenging (and unfair at times, with advantage to those who had taken Linear Algebra already, or with questions designed so that algebraic errors would propagate and cost you a lot of points). It sounds strange but I would suggest including one challenge question on each pset not found in the textbook that would really make students think about the concepts rather than the steps they'd memorized; one question where students were almost forced to go to office hours every week, you know? I don't feel like I have a great understanding of the ideas behind all the methods we used (but I sure do know how to use those methods!). Also as an engineer I will always cry for more application of these topics worked into the curriculum! It seemed very here and there. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Beth\r\nWeakness: Maybe textbook ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the sheer amount of content is too much, and most of the problem sets were all very long. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized but very fast paced, and difficult to keep up with if you don't have a strong background in calculus. ",
            "\u00a0The material is taught well. I always learned with Professor Bennett. She is a wonderful professor. Honestly, no weaknesses in the course. I would appreciate a review session before the exams. KEY NOTE: Study with the ODEs all mixed up because they will not be separated out on the exam. (example: exact equations, first order linear ODEs will all be mixed together) ",
            "\u00a0Beth is extremely organized and a really great teacher. The level of difficulty in class/problem sets was pretty different from midterms/finals, in a bad way, meaning the exams were way harder. I don't mind a hard class, but that discrepancy kind of shocked me, so to improve it I would say provide practice material for any tests. I know it was Beth's first semester teaching the class, but in every other STEM course I've taken there has been practice material. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were clear and well organized, and the psets seemed to support class quite well. However, the questions on the exams were unlike what we had seen before in terms of complexity and combining material from across chapters. Without materials to help prepare for exams, we were left with only old psets and lecture notes, which didn't contain problems that were of the same caliber that we got on exams. More exam materials, such as a practice test, would have gone a long way. "

I would not recommend this course to anyone not interested in STEM, or anyone who does not plan on using the methods taught in this course in you career or future courses. However, you definitely learn how to solve differential equations, with applications in physics, such as forced and damp oscillations, which confused me in my introductory physics courses (I did not know how we solved certain equations in physics, but now I do!). ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who 1. Do not care about their GPA; 2. Are math gods; 3. Have the ability to take the course Credit/D/Fail. Dr. Bennett is an incredible lecturer and prepares thorough notes for every lecture, so, no matter what, you are guaranteed to learn A LOT from this course. However, Dr. Bennett's midterm exams are very difficult. They are essentially impossible to finish in the time allowed, and some of the problems on those tests were unlike any I had seen either in lecture or on the homework. To make matters worse, the grading is very harsh. Of 91 people originally taking the course, about 35 were to receive some sort of A and 35 to receive some sort of B, leaving the rest with a worse grade. Dr. Bennett informed us of this grading after the first midterm. This made many of us very stressed, and even caused 9 people to instantly drop the course. So, you cannot get an A in this course unless you are a math god. The competition in this course due to Bennett's grading is rather toxic. If you can take the course Credit/D/Fail, definitely do it. But if your GPA matters to you, stay away. ",

I took this class more for the fun of it than anything, and I was not disappointed. However, I have heard bad things about the class in previous semesters, so I'm sure the quality of the teaching has a big impact on your perception of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely encourage any engineering or applied science student to take this class as the methods taught in this class to solve problems are applicable for most STEM fields and professor Bennett teaches the material really well. Even if you are not an engineering student, it may be fun (though challenging) to take this class for fun if you would like to learn how to solve this class of problems (its quite fun!) without getting too deep into the theoretical details that the math major differential equations class will get into.

            "\u00a0Though a difficult course with difficult grading (about 35% of the class gets an A or A-), I would recommend this course to another student because it is taught extremely well and many practical examples are also covered, which can be missing from a traditional math class. ",
            "\u00a0I actually enjoyed the course a lot, even though it felt tedious many times, it was nice that the material was relatively easy to get a grasp on. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching is fantastic. Take this class if you want to take a differential equations class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only if they need it for their major. I didn't, so I was kicking myself the whole semester for not having taken something else. That said, I did fine in the course. ",
            "\u00a0If its with Professor Bennet and they want to learn to solve a lot of different types of partial differential equations (but are okay with not knowing the proofs behind those methods), I would. ",
            "\u00a0Most people do not take ENAS 194 for fun. However, I would recommend this class even if it is not one of your requirements - given that Professor Bennett is the one teaching it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was very helpful for my major - physics ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class if you need to fulfill the math requirement for the physics major (which I needed to do). You learn a lot about differential equations and how to solve them, and the psets are pretty chill. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are extremely into math and/or it is required for your major would I take this class. ",
            "\u00a0If it weren't a requirement, I probably wouldn't recommend it because I haven't quite experienced its usefulness yet, but as for math courses, I enjoyed it. But the exams were pretty rough for me so then again maybe not. I'd say opt for a more inherently interesting QR credit. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a course I would recommend to a student who wants to gain a deeper understanding in Math who isn't a math major. The concepts are interesting but I will say that this class is very hard and very much kicked my butt but it was cool learning some sick math. Also the professor really cares about the students and enjoys teaching ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was well taught and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this with Professor Bennett. She is incredibly clear in her explanations, writes great class notes, and clearly cares a lot about teaching well. I wasnt required to take this course, but Im glad that I did because it was useful, interesting, and very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a lot of material, but under Beth, the course is taught well and fair. Good intro to ordinary and partial DEs ",
            "\u00a0Unless you need to take this class for a major, I don't think there's much mathematical or intellectual curiosity you'll satisfy by taking the class. I only took it because of my major, and I didn't enjoy it. For most of the class, I felt like we were simply learning the names of methods and memorizing a very convoluted series of steps to get the answer. I vaguely knew what differential equations were before starting the class, but most topics were newly introduced to me. I was confused for more than half the classes, but I also did not read the textbook before class. I would also recommend having experience in linear algebra BEFORE taking this class. There were a few chapters on systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, matrices, etc. that took me a long time to learn even outside of doing the problem set. I also felt like the classes were too packed with material, and we had to rush to finish everything. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to take it and are well-prepared in calculus.  The problem sets are extremely time consuming and I found it difficult to do well despite my best efforts. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Professor Bennett is wonderful in all ways. She can teach the material well. She writes the best lecture notes. She is always available via office hours. My only criticism is that the grade distribution at the end of the course was tough relative to typical Yale grades. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you want/need to learn how to do calculations better.  It is hard, but you will improve a palpable amount. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially any hard science major who wants to learn about DEs. There weren't a ton of applications, so don't be scared off by the fact that this is an engineering class. "
