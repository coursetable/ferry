            "\u00a0I learned a lot not only about antebellum literature, but also about antebellum history in ways that I haven't been exposed to in other courses so far. Professor Warner allows his students a lot of freedom in terms of choosing what they want to write their papers about, which was a really good challenge in terms of coming up with identifying a problem/something intriguing and analyzing that for yourself. ",
            "\u00a0This was a strong overview of the literature of this time, including fiction, poetry, and essays/autobiography. For me, this course (which is cross-listed in American Studies) helped integrate the literature of the specific time period with its historical context, something Professor Warner really emphasizes. Also, many people probably covered these writers in high school English, but I never did - so I felt it was filling in a good gap in my English foundation! ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to craft analytical essays and to discuss dense texts in their historical context. I learned so much about American history and truly enjoyed listening to Professor Warner's gems of wisdom on such interesting topics as American experiments in communal living, the national obsession with Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Walt Whitman's exploration of sexuality in his poems. ",
            "\u00a0The course explored the breadth of American literature in the years leading up to the Civil War. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing and reading abilities. I developed an appreciation for the antebellum period in American history and literature. ",
            "\u00a0A classic English seminar that gives an excellent background in pre-civil war American Literature (Obviously). Special attention is given to mapping how thought evolved in this time period, with Gothic literature and transcendentalism as well as literature on race and slavery. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0strengths-the wide variety of authors that we read and background knowledge that Warner has about almost everything within the Antebellum period\r\nweaknessess- sometimes class discussions were not that engaging, just because some of the reading is dry and long, so people felt less inclined to pay as close attention to it than an invigorating discussion demands. maybe a reworking of the syllabus would solve this in some way? ",
            "\u00a0Professor Warner runs a very engaging and thought-provoking seminar. My class was small, so the contributions of every student were really valued and we got to tailor the discussion to our interests and concerns in the text. The texts were diverse enough that there was something for everyone to take a particular interest in (even if, like me, this isn't your favorite subcategory of literature). What I saw as a potential weakness (others may disagree) was that the weekly reading load was quite high (could be 3-5 hours for a single class's reading if you do it thoroughly). I hate feeling unprepared for class but often didn't get all the way through the reading. Then in class, we would usually only discuss very small portions of the text; that depth was nice but there were cases when I would have preferred some of the reading to be optional if it were not going to be emphasized in class. There also was not much guidance on the papers--Prof Warner is very accessible and helpful in office hours, but a specific assignment or task would have been a good starting point. When it came time for the final paper I struggled to integrate outside research, as we hadn't gotten much practice doing so throughout the semester. In other classes (like Engl 128), there were exercises during the course to practice engaging history and criticism before writing the final paper, so I think that would have been really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Warner is phenomenal. He is so knowledgeable, but not domineering, and lets us steer the discussion in whichever direction we find most intriguing. We read so many texts; I feel like I have gained a deep and broad understanding of antebellum literature, and understand how different authors and texts interacted. Professor Warner gave extremely helpful and clear feedback on our papers--thank you.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like there was simply too much reading to do it thoughtfully--or to do it at all--especially when we were reading Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Scarlet Letter-- and there were a LOT of Poe stories assigned at once. I wish Professor Warner had told us which parts to focus on specifically so that if we needed to skim some chapters, we knew which ones were less important. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Warner is good at facilitating discussion and drawing attention to the major points of literary contention within the books we read. I think the course could be benefited by some secondary readings to help students to better understand the history moment of the literature. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and the professor has a lot of interesting things to say. I think the course could have somewhat more student discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The class ended up being smaller than perhaps was best to facilitate discussion. However, Professor Warner was excellent and engaging, driving discussion in interesting and surprising directions. "

            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have a particular interest in this time period, in American history/literature in particular, or in the specific writers on the syllabus. I think it would be a particularly interesting literary perspective for History or American Studies majors; for English majors, the focus departs pretty significantly from the traditional English department close-reading model. Professor Warner is excellent and will definitely push your writing. If you take it, be prepared for a high reading load. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course if you are prepared to read many long texts at a rapid pace (think: The Scarlet Letter in a week, Uncle Tom's Cabin over Thanksgiving break, etc.). It is a higher-level English course for a reason; I took it at the beginning of sophomore year not realizing how challenging it would be, but it proved very rewarding. Professor Warner is extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general, so take advantage of the opportunity to ask him specific questions and go to his office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. Professor Warner is a really interesting person with a lot of fascinating insights. You will learn a lot from him. He also really helps you out with essays. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Warner is great and, for people interested in American literature, it gives a good background in how American thought evolved and the roots of the ideologies that we love today. "
