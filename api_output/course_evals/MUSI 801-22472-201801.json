            "\u00a0A broad exposure to methodologies for dealing with the term \"modernism\" and its historical constituents. The class simultaneously problematized the term and clarified its many connotations for the different groups it serves.\r\nApproaches to musical hermeneutics and analysis, particularly with large, unwieldy scores such as Zarathustra and Mahler 3. \r\nA look into Nietzchieian philosophy. \r\nA lot of criticism of secondary source scholarship, and discussing warring camps within various scholarly circles.
