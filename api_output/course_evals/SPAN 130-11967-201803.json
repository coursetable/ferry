            "\u00a0I re-learned the grammatical concepts I had learned in Span 110-120 and gained additional insight from practicing these skills in a variety of ways. The Supersite homework, the course packet readings, the novela, and even some videos were used to help me practice my spanish. ",

            "\u00a0I  greatly increased my ability to speak and understand Spanish. I also learned about Spanish literature and film. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly just got torn apart by Grammar I didn't get any better at the language. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to speak more fluidly and better collect my thoughts to translate them into spanish. Learned more about spanish culture as well. ",
            "\u00a0Deepened knowledge of the Spanish language. ",

            "\u00a0This course was easy enough to keep up with and I always felt like I was getting something out of it! The only weakness worth addressing here was the unequal distribution of work from day to day and week to week. Some days we would only have 30 minutes of homework and others we had at least an hour if not more (typically Thursdays, but not always). There was also a week near the end (the novela week) where we had four chapters to read a night and several comprehension questions to answer; this took a few hours to complete, which was rough given this week was full of exams for many students. I would like to see the workload spread a little more evenly for future students if possible. ",
            "\u00a0very heavy workload ",
            "\u00a0This course was very immersive and meeting every day was a fantastic way to improve skills rapidly. I thought the material covered was very useful and engaging. The pace of the class was very manageable and the size of the class was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that you got to practice your Spanish everyday. There were also plenty of resources for learning the material in each chapter. The weakness, however, was how variable some of the assignments were. Every other day was some random new type of assignment, and that got obnoxious at some point. And even if you get to practice Spanish everyday, I would have appreciated the syllabus letting up once in a while. Instead, you get hit with assignment after assignment -- and not always particularly difficult, but just long and annoying. ",
            "\u00a0I hate language classes at Yale and the structure and how you only really get graded on how well you can do Grammar on tests. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the pace, the number of activities, and teaching style. Weakness was the time at which the novel was introduced. Would have liked to seen it earlier in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a good course and a good instructor. However, the fact that we were asked to read an entire novel in a single week after never having read a novel before was ridiculous. The Marquez novel should have been spread out over two or even three weeks; it was simply ridiculous (and a little unacceptable) that we went from having half an hour of homework a night to having to spend three hours on chapters and reading questions each day, right before finals. Also, the book is online for free and we were asked to buy a $25 copy just for the discussion questions. Just provide the questions. Also we should have a chance to practice formal oral exams before the final. "

            "\u00a0Yeah! I think this is the easiest spanish I've taken so far and it's realllly nice to get a refresher on spanish before continuing or  wrapping up the language requirement! ",
            "\u00a0yes, required/ necessary ",
            "\u00a0This course was my favorite course this semester so I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I loved all of the vocabulary and grammar that we learned and the teaching style was very clear and effective. The various methods of learning such as reading literature and having conversations was an amazing way to practice the skills we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0If one has to complete their language requirement, then yes. Otherwise, there are probably better other classes you could take for exposure to the Spanish language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I mean yeah you have to take a language requirement but especially if you've never taken a language class you're completely screwed if you take Spanish since everyone has already taken it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because while it continues to review the same lessons found in earlier spanish courses, it moves at a much faster pace and touches upon different lessons not previously learned as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's part of the Spanish track. "
