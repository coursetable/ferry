The first month of the class goes over simple harmonic oscillators (waves), the middle bulk of the class goes over the Maxwells equations (with detours into different types of circuits) and the last couple of classes go over quantum wave theory and the Schrodinger's equation in brief.

It's not that difficult, but it's a step up from last semester, and Daisuke is a lot less forgiving than Simon was. The problem sets were easier, but the exams were probably a little harder. I really appreciated all the different levels of support and how frequently available office hours and study halls were.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not great. Daisuke could have made the material a lot more engaging through demos or through more problem solving. He spent a ton of time every single class on logistics (like when the next study hall would be (it was the same schedule every week)) and then often rushed right through all the actual content. He had a hard time answering students' questions and wasn't that responsive/didn't make real adjustments to his pace or teaching style when it was clear we didn't understand (which he could confirm very easily from polling questions or actual questions). There was very little material applicable to life science this semester, which helped a lot last semester in terms of understanding the material conceptually, and there was very little emphasis on problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0Good modules, but overall the workload is just grossly disproportional compared to the amount required for other classes. If every class had the amount of work that physics profs somehow feel they are entitled to assign then it would be physically impossible to complete all the work needed in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Daisuke is an understanding professor, but often one that puts too much on his students. If you are open and talk to him during class about difficulty, he'll try to adjust. \r\n\r\nPSETs need to be reworked, only a few of the questions feel relevant, the rest seem out-of-nowhere. I feel like I learn the PSETs in retrospect because there's so much thrown at you to begin with. Some end up being very helpful for exams; graded PSETs should focus on these, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nQuiz system (with a few group quizzes and 3 drops) is perfect, I'd say. \r\n\r\nExams are typically fair, though on the difficult side. ",
            "\u00a0This class was exhausting. However, you are supported by a dedicated staff of TAs, peer tutors, and the professor. Students also support each other which is great. ",

            "\u00a0Overall, this was a good course. The workload was high, but manageable. I am very glad I took 171 over 181 because I feel as though I was able to manage this course much easier. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is study hall and the peer tutors. They are really helpful and great! The module notes are also very helpful and (in my opinion) way more convenient and straightforward to deal with than a whole textbook. A weakness would basically be almost everything else. The class was unorganized and confusing, the material was not well taught, and the experience was overall a little frustrating. I still think this is a better option than the 180/181 sequence if you're pre-med and just need to take physics, because there is no question that the 180/181 material is way more difficult, and the 180/181 psets are much longer. That being said, in no way did I enjoy this class. Daisuke does not explain concepts clearly, and I've had to consistently learn everything from reading the modules on my own because I don't understand anything from lecture, which is a frustrating experience. I also feel like the course generally tries to incorporate higher level concepts on a very surface level (like eigenvalues/eigenvectors) without teaching the full math behind them, which makes it really hard for me to fully understand what I'm learning and why. The Monday quizzes were also kind of dumb hard this semester if I'm being honest. Just unnecessary! And I still don't understand why they changed the grading policy from being able to get 40% of missed points back on midterms with corrections in 170, to just 30% in 171. That just seemed like an arbitrary change and was pretty annoying. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the other students and the TAs and peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Daisuke is a really supportive and sweet professor, exams are fair because they are similar to psets and practice exams, very collaborative environment, you are rewarded for your hard work \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes Daisuke would spend too much time in the beginning of lecture talking about broad topics, but I preferred it if he spent more time doing clicker questions ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets help advance understanding. Lectures were a repeat of the module notes and did not expand knowledge or explicate material further. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized. good/ relevant content\r\n\r\nweaknesseS: extremely time consuming. professor diasuke didn't have official office hours or come to study hall so I didn't get to discuss my questions with him as often as I would have liked to. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was excellent in facilitating collaborative work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is conducive to a collaborative learning community for students, daisuke is very friendly and warm and always makes himself available for students (out of all the STEM professors I've had, he and Simon have cared the most about students)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - quizzes are very difficult and at times could be unreasonable, one of the midterms was very difficult, and sometimes I felt that the concepts were not well-explained, especially when we were on the modules dealing with gauss's law and ampere's law ",
            "\u00a0Not all, but a good portion of the psets were overly long and hard. They didn't accurately reflect what we'd been doing in class, so we were often unprepared. This was a bigger problem in 170 and not 171, but it was still true. The Monday quizzes were helpful to keep up to date on things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Peer Tutors, TAs, Professor's Office Hours\r\n- reasonable workload for psets near exam times\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- course material was not well taught all the time and the module was not helpful in clarifying concepts ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the TAs and the community centered aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was not a very well-run or well-taught course. The lectures started off dull, and grew increasingly weak, disorganized, and incomprehensible. There was no reason to pay attention in class because doing so never got me anywhere. All the learning happens in study hall and with friends or peer tutors. Problem sets were shorter but quizzes and midterms were harder, and while its not that hard to get a decent grade, the fact was that the lecture content, modules, psets, quizzes, and exams all tested different things, and a lot of preparation was not necessarily rewarded, as it was in 170. Its not a mean-spirited intro class, but its a slog, and altogether weaker than first semester. The lecturing in particular needs a ton of work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT. I cannot stress enough what a difference this has made in the learning experience for all students. Not only are we NOT graded on a CURVE (against each other), but it is also clear that the PROFESSOR, TEACHING FELLOWS, AND PEER TUTORS all care about the success of the students, and are willing to take the time and energy to help them as much as they can.  We are all on the SAME TEAM! I seriously hope all STEM courses, especially PRE-MED courses can learn from this course, and try to model their courses after it (in the ways that are applicable for the respective fields). This course has by a LANDSLIDE been my BEST experience in STEM at Yale thus far. And this course was no easier than other STEM courses -- in fact, I think it was much more intellectually challenging than some others! ",
            "\u00a0Format of course with lecture and study hall is really good ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how the material was structured, starting with simple oscillators, learning about electricity and magnetism, and then returning to learn about electromagnetic waves which have both fluctuating electric and magnetic fields. I wished more time was spent on the last part, learning more about the Schrodinger equation and quantum mechanics, but there simply wasn't enough time. I never felt like I truly understood the wave equation, just knew how to apply it in limited circumstances. Otherwise, the class was interesting, fair, and rewarding. If you've taken MATH120 you will probably find this class pretty easy since most of the conceptual work is figuring out how to take certain types of integrals in different situations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: peer tutors and study hall\r\nWeaknesses: poll everywhere ",
            "\u00a0The presentations during class moved along far too quickly without giving me a chance to process what was going on. However, the TAs and ULAs readily made themselves available for questions, as well as Professor Nagai. ",
            "\u00a0I like the study hall hours. I feel as though the course itself can cover more example problems in class and less theory. ",
            "\u00a0It covers a lot of material, but honestly the topics aren't taught well and students struggle to keep up. They end up learning all the material in study halls with the TAs doing the psets rather then in lecture. and the professor didn't even show up to the study halls. Considering his office hours were during the day, some people couldn't make them so coming to study hall would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is that the weekly problem sets and quizzes as well as the 2 midterms helped me stay on top of the material. I would have appreciated learning more about how the things we learned could be applied to situations we might actually encounter in life or phenomena that was less abstract. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were not very clear - I ended up having to do a lot of learning on my own. But peer tutors are very helpful and basically got me through the course. ",
            "\u00a0great TAs, student tutors and instructor! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the problem sets took less time this semester, and they were more straightforward. The course is well structured and organized. The course also has ample resources to help students if they are struggling. The modules, unfortunately, were less cohesive this semester and I used them less as a study tool. Instead, I used practice questions and questions from the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There is a lot of support and help for this course. Daisuke and the TA/Peer tutor team have a lot of office hours and study hall sessions to help you with psets and general conceptual understanding of concepts. I think the quizzes were a great way to keep up with the course content and to make sure that we have a good conceptual understanding of what was covered. \r\nWeakness: The quizzes toward the end of the semester were a lot more difficult than what was covered in the lecture, and I felt less prepared for those. Lecture at times felt a little rushed towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0The exams and homework for this course was structured much more reasonably than for 180/181. At the beginning of the semester the lectures were almost painfully slow, but overall the course is not bad. The exam re-grading process is really strange and i would much prefer to have students re-do the problems correctly than the strange problem evaluation system they have going on now. As it stands exam corrections were very obscure and i heard from several students that hardly anyone got any points back at all. ",
            "\u00a0I will say that the organization of the course made a little more sense than PHYS 170, but there were definitely modules that made no sense to be included. For one, the inclusion of quantum mechanics (especially the style in which it was presented) made no sense for us to learn, especially in the last days of class. However, the worst part about this course had to be the professor. In my experience in STEM intro classes here at Yale, the only professor who was worse as a teacher was Alanna Schepartz for organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0This course was probably all strengths. It was the best introductory STEM class I have taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0Quizzes varied hugely in difficulty, from unreasonably hard to extremely easy. A better attempt to regulate this would have helped. The lectures were a bit dry: more pictures maybe? Otherwise relatively well taught for the material at hand. "
