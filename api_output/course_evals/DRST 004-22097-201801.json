            "\u00a0This course taught me valuable information about modern philosophers from Descartes to Murdoch. I also learned how to fix my writing to fall more within the sphere of philosophical writing. ",

            "\u00a0We studied a broad overview of western philosophy from the 17th century on to modern 20th century theories of metaphysics and morality. I learned how to read philosophy with much less trouble and understand the theories relationship to their predecessors. I believe that I can now read similar western philosophy on my own and comprehend the main arguments. I learned how to refute theories and still find what is useful within them. This course has honestly changed my life. I look at the world differently, question things I never used to, am more mindful, (as well as a little more paranoid about reality) and am more sure of what the nature of knowledge is and that I want to seek more of it.

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was in the quality of the discussion afforded by the readings, but a lot of the concepts were difficult to grasp if the student had no previous philosophy experience before DS. ",
            "\u00a0i wish professor winkler had directed our conversations a little more ",
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy in the spring is amazing--this was my favorite DS course by far. It's a survey intro to all of the major questions that have been facing humanity for the past several hundred years. What could be better? And it teaches you philosophical writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very difficult; the texts are very tough and there is a lot of reading. Sometimes it felt like a marathon and a sprint at the same time. As I had never read philosophy before DS, I was never exactly sure how to go about it. I think the great strengths of this course are the texts we read and the wonderful professors who teach them. However I think a great weakness was not giving us more guidance. I wanted to read more of the texts and participate more in class than I was able to. I did go to office hours but I was always struggling with the workload and the comprehension. I think it would be helpful to hold sessions throughout the year about how to read philosophy: what to look for and the speed with which you should go about it. I tried many of my own strategies but always felt like I was on my own in my struggles. Not all the students feel this way but I think many do and sessions like that might help them. I also think it would be good to introduce DS study hours and/or study groups. I struggled with time management, so at least at the beginning of the semester I think it would be helpful to establish times for people to work and not do other things: so they learn what kind of a commitment it is going to be and feel like they can reach out to other DS students to discuss things outside of class earlier on. Some of my favorite parts of DS was spontaneously talking to other students about the texts outside of class and I wish that I could have been doing that from the very beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the instructor was strong and class was always easy to follow and highly informative. The only identifiable weaknesses had to do with weaknesses in the ds curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0This course presents students with some of the most challenging ideas and texts in all the DS syllabi. Although I enjoyed how the student voice was placed first in discussion, I would appreciate it if we went  through the arguments systematically before trying to refute them and pick them apart. "
