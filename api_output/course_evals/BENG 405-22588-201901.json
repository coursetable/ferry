            "\u00a0I gained insight into how real public health projects in the development world work and some of the challenges they face. ",
            "\u00a0Learned skills for ideation and systems thinking, learned the importance of including target communities early on from the design phase of a product, learned the value of mere observance, learned how to pitch a biotech solution to a large problem and apply for grant funding. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge on innovating solutions, implementing in low-resource settings. niche field of knowledge but a super interesting one if you are interested in global health. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the hands on nature of the class. The seminar was half lecture and half workshops which was great. ",
            "\u00a0Design thinking, people-oriented research an innovation ",
            "\u00a0I learned about design thinking, the current issues facing biotechnology development and implementation in developing countries, and about the whole process of humanitarian aid research. "

            "\u00a0Doesn't teach you much in terms of the science/biotechnology, but you learn a lot about project management and troubleshooting. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: professor Gonzalez has a very interesting background and teaches ideation and systems thinking really well. I loved the electrical engineering lab that we did, that was really a wonderful part of the course. Another strength is that the midterm and final are done in teams, which is much rarer than anticipated at Yale. The guest lecturer from MSF and Professor Clarke were very engaging speakers.\r\nWeakness: participation is not graded and some people would skip class and not contribute. The grading criteria was very unclear: TAs would take off points in reading responses for inconsistent judgements about what needed to be cited and what an adequate sharing of personal stories was. For the current events project as well, it was not made clear that no one would actually read our paper and the content of our presentation honestly didn't matter, just that we turned the paper in and gave the presentation. The amount of effort and quality of content put into these assignments, therefore, is not actually considered in grading, which seems to be an oversight.\r\nThe talk about failure would have been more interesting had we had a class discussion on it rather than listen to that guest lecturer talk about Apple's failed product for 45 minutes. He was not a great lecturer, and the gimmicky graphics made that lecture feel more like a bad Ted Talk. ",
            "\u00a0a couple of the readings in the beginning of the course were pretty problematic and were just taken at face value in class instead of being used as examples of neo-colonialist thinking in global health, which was disappointing. some classes were a bit repetitive. it was great to learn about a lot of different perspectives on the process from innovation to implementation to maintenance. ",
            "\u00a0Don't get me wrong, this is a great class. You'll learn about global health and be able to apply knowledge with hands on presentations and group projects and have a lot of great speakers come in. That said, I was disappointed with the level of engagement from the professor. Office hours were nonexistent. She didn't show up to a number of classes, one of which was a class for final presentations. Even when she was there, she was on her computer going through her email while students presented, which came across as disrespectful. ALL grading was clearly completed by the TAs. The professor often didn't even respond to emails and would forward to a TA who would help you out. Because the TAs were great this year, the class still ran smoothly, but don't expect to get a chance to form a relationship with the professor. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that Professor Gonzalez is AWESOME. She is so smart and engaging during lectures, and very easily reached if you need to speak one-on-one. You really get an overview of how to think and plan effectively for humanitarian aid projects. The speakers are great too. I think the only way it can be improved is by having more discussions after guest speakers, and discussion of our reading responses during class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, its a great 5th class! Not very difficult but you do come away from the course thinking differently. Great for anyone thinking of doing any work in the developing world. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very chill class that incorporates a variety of disciplines into the curriculum, which is cool. The midterm and final are group project-based, which is fun and a change of pace for most Yale courses. Lots of the information at the beginning of the course -- Millennium Development Goals, SGDs, economic metrics like GDP, how vaccines work, etc. -- was redundant for me as a senior EVST major. There are some interesting guest lecturers that come from orgs like Doctors Without Boarders. Professor Gonzalez is really cool and teaches systems thinking and idea brainstorming/development really well. ",
            "\u00a0yeah. very interesting material. pretty low-stress: weekly reading responses and two projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yestake this class! Its super interesting, not that much work, and Prof Gonzalez is amazing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof. Gonzalez is a great lecturer and the topic is overall relevant and important to many fields of study ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested about the process of creating and implementing biotechnological innovations. As a pre-med, this topic was totally outside of any class I had taken before, and it was fun to brainstorm and think like an engineer. Take this class if you want a project-based course, because that's what it mostly is. "
