I feel more confident in my understanding of the ideas that have formed the foundations of political philosophy. I would have liked to read more works by women/ethnic minorities as it seems more relevant to society today. The lectures were lower in quality compared to the other lectures in Directed Studies, however, and I think it could be improved. ",
