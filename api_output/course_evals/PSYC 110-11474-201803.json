The reading responses required me to find ways in which what we learned connected to the real world, which was an interesting skill to work on. The course basically only tested one's ability to memorize and regurgitate information, so developing methods for memorization played a key role.\r\nBut I also learned a huge amount about humans and the way we behave, feel, and think, which is a crucial part to understanding the world. Overall it was a great course and I would recommend taking it. ",

In lecture, it is difficult to copy everything Prof. Holmes is saying in my notes, but when I go back to the lectures, there is often just a picture and I can't quite remember the point being made. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong because it was interesting and relatable. Its weaknesses would include a few of the lectures (such as the methods lecture and the guest lecture) and the fact that it doesn't dive into any topic for more than one lecture. The memorization aspect of the course was challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of different topics discussed, tests and assignments were very reasonable and the class prepared you well for them, not too much work, engaging material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Topics were not covered super in depth (as is to be expected from an introductory course that covers so many topics) ",
            "\u00a0The course was relatively small for what is usually a super big lecture, making it much more approachable to talk with Professor Holmes after class. Unfortunately, even despite the smaller class size, there weren't any opportunities to ask questions during lecture (which Holmes himself admitted on the first day of class), but his willingness to answer questions outside of lecture itself makes up for that. There are enough pop culture references interspersed with class content to make the lectures engaging, and the class itself is a good mix of midterm exams and reading responses, but the final book report paper felt extraneous in that it didn't help me learn more about psychology. ",
            "\u00a0kind of an easy course, which I liked bc it made me more focused on learning material than on my grade....but, I also felt like I was memorizing more than critically thinking when I was studying for the exam ",

            "\u00a0The book review assignment was utterly meaningless and pedagogically lazy. It consisted of picking one of three pop psychology books to summarize and find real-life applications for. I was unaware that high school-level assignments were appropriate for college-level courses. It seemed like the book review was a purely filler assignment included in the syllabus only to add some \"heft\" and perhaps a certain level of legitimacy to the course. I am extremely disappointed with whoever suggested, approved, or finalized the inclusion of this inane book review assignment in the course; they would obviously benefit from a refresher in basic pedagogy. Ultimately, the book review was nothing more than an exercise in futility, successful only in wasting students' time and effort. I strongly recommend against taking this course until this assignment is purged from the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course lie in the material which is inherently interesting and widely applicable. However, I believe that the assignments are terrible, and did not help increase understanding of the material at all. ",
            "\u00a0If there's going to be so much emphasis on the lecture, please make the lecture slides comprehensible. The professor assumes that we have the ability to write down every relevant idea that he explains. Missing anything he talks about is very problematic, because going back to the lecture slides in the future assuredly won't help you. Also, please get rid of the five credit experiment participation requirement; I really don't feel like my knowledge of psychology increased because of them. The experiments are burdens, not learning experiences. Lastly, in the exams, there is way too much emphasis on trivial details of psychology. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is its organization. The lectures, homework, and assessments are all very predictable and easy to follow. \r\nThe biggest weakness would be the disconnect between the readings and the lectures. Readings were very rarely alluded to in lecture, and they would emerge again for exams. This made studying a difficult, disjointed process as I tried to determine what information from the readings and textbook would be lumped in with the bulk of knowledge from the lectures. \r\nThe class has little room for improvement; overall a good intro class. ",
            "\u00a0Less reading off the slides, less monotone\r\nMaybe not using the textbook to teach, but instead making readings be some interesting papers and articles from the field (like the other psych professors do) ",

            "\u00a0Course is great - lectures were fun and informative, reading responses were good as well. I appreciated how we got personalised feedback on the reading responses. The exams are not cumulative, which allows you to give your full attention to whatever topic you are discussing at a go. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of information to memorize all at once, but it is nice how each exam only covers the material learned after the previous unit/exam. Would have been nice if more than one review session was held for each exam, as I was not able to attend some of them due to other conflicts. ",

            "\u00a0The content was very interesting, though perhaps the exams could have more application of the content ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was that the course definitely at least touched on pretty much any aspect of psychology that you'd expect from an intro course, but the structure of the course could be improved. Oftentimes, lectures were very unrelated to one another. ",
            "\u00a0It provided me with a lot of information that was interesting to learn about. However, it did move very fast through all the lectures and I was dissatisfied with the review sessions as they were not as helpful as I had hoped. It was more haphazard. ",
            "\u00a0Instead of reading responses I would prefer discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides were too minimalistic to be very helpful when returning to them as study materials. I understand that this may be intentional to discourage students from not attending lecture, but during the final review session I attended the slides were so sparse that even the TAs had difficulty determining what the relevant content was. ",
            "\u00a0The mandatory lab that takes up at least 5 hours of the students time should be counted for some type of grade, very unfair that it doesn't show up at all as apart of the grade. Also the students grade shouldn't be determined entirely on the tests. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job in introducing the various fields of psychology, which Im assuming is the purpose of the class. I wish that we didnt jump around so much however, but I understand why it occurs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are fairly interesting \r\nImprovement: The lecture slides are not usable to study from and it is vague what we should study for the exams, the grading for the reading responses fluctuates a lot ",
            "\u00a0Topics covered are pretty representative of psychology as a whole and give a good overview. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor holmes is great, clear, and engaging. The class touches a myriad of topics and thus if you don't like a subject, you seldom deal with it for more than a week. The TFs hold review sessions which allows you that extra opportunity to review and confront people who know before an exam. The textbook very closely corresponds to the course and thus if you cannot make it to class, can provide a good substitute (don't be fooled that you can't just study from the book) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is your quintessential big lecture course, and with the absence of the exams, you aren't really tested on what you understand. Its hard to figure out what you don't know until right before. The exams are generally pretty straightforwards, but you need to know small details. The lab requirement feels kinda tacked on and I feel the class doesn't spend enough time making you examine the breakdown of how studies work and experimental control. ",
            "\u00a0Very boring and not interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly  could've been a little more rigorous; not sure how much I learnt as opposed to memorized. It would probably be better as a flipped classroom to be honest. ",
            "\u00a0The course is alright - I would have loved MORE opportunities (like optional section) to learn about the material, simple lecture was not enough to make me feel like I was really learning. I did, however, enjoy the Book Review assignment, which asked us to analyze contemporary Psychological work. However, my least favorite part of the course was certainly the mandatory study hours. Although there were (seemingly difficult) ways around these hours, they made me feel like a Lab Rat rather than a college student. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-organized, and the format of non-cumulative midterms was perfect. I feel like I have a good understanding of these concepts because I was able to be more specific when studying each topic. ",
            "\u00a0I was very satisfied with this course. If I could change anything, Professor Holmes mentioned that we never had a lecture on aging and I think that would be an interesting addition. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Holmes taught this class exceptionally well. The tests were a very accurate representation of the material that was taught in the class, so if you studied a lot, you were more than capable of doing very well in the class. Assignments were graded very fairly. \r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any ",
            "\u00a0The material covered was interesting and covered a breadth of topics, but the lectures were often somewhat dry and boring. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture is pretty good, but it is definitely necessary to read the textbook to really understand the concepts. Would be cool to have a section with greater student discussion.  The psychology study requirement is absolutely pointless and only to help those majoring in psychology fulfill their research requirements, despite the fact that the results are essentially meaningless beyond the scope of Yale students taking introductory psychology.

The material is not especially difficult, but remains quite interesting regardless, and can connect with many fields of study (philosophy, biology, history, political science, chemistry, and even engineering and physics if you show up to Holmes's class in the middle of the semester). If you're premed, note that Holmes doesn't tend to cover vocab words that appear on the MCAT; he emphasizes themes and ideas instead, which I think are more important in the long run. But if you're looking to use PSYC 110 as a MCAT crash course, you might be disappointed. If you're interested in learning for learning, this is the class for you. ",
