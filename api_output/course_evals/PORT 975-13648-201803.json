            "\u00a0Concrete Poetry from a pluralistic perspective, profound analysis of Brazilian Concrete Poetry and new theoretical perspectives from Brazil that are underrepresented in current debates. Not only did we read texts by the group Noigandres we were also motivated to expand our knowledge in international Concrete Poetry (Gomringer, Bense, Finlay) and develop creative research projects. I learned how to read Concrete Poetry, engage with Brazilian debates in an international context and how to shape arguments. ",

            "\u00a0The smaller size of the course created a good and instructive atmosphere, where everyone could develop their own skills. I received an insightful perspective of poetic techniques and the concrete movement. I was always looking forward to meet Professor Jackson and my colleagues in the course! "

            "\u00a0Yes, because Professor Jackson is an expert in Concrete Poetry and really knows the field. There is the right balanance between guidance and space for developing personal academic skills. We also went to the British Art Gallery and to Beineke together to deepen our knowledge and really engage with the material. This opened a perspective for my future projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want to understand concrete poetry in all its complexity, take this course. "
