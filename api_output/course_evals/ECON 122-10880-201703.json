I can only hope whoever is reading this can flag the overwhelming negative feedback from these reviews youll be receiving. While Nordhaus might be an excellent scholar, this man should not be teaching students a required class in the major any longer. I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have in this class.\r\n\r\nThe course was extremely poorly organized. We had 4 problem sets and 4 quizzes instead of the usual 8 problem sets format, which was a valid idea. We were given practice problems to prepare for the first quiz, but no solutions (which is standard in other STEM courses) - as a consequence, there was no way of knowing whether you were on track to grasping the material or not. When we requested solutions for the next quiz, Nordhaus  not only denied our request, but also decided to provide no practice questions at all. As a result, everyone felt completely blind walking into other quizzes.\r\n\r\nThe material covered in class was relatively straightforward, and Nordhaus clearly chose to focus on minor things he found more interesting rather than covering the more challenging problems (he was also often overly theatrical to the point it was counterproductive to learning). However, the problem was that the problem sets, quizzes, and midterms were MUCH more quantitative and asked of us we be extremely comfortable handling graphs, equations, and such. The class material covered in class did not equip us in the slightest to do this. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the slides regularly had typos and blatant mistakes in them that Nordhaus would take weeks to fix and repost on Canvas, and our TA had to spent time in section to highlight Nordhaus mistakes so we would not make errors in upcoming assessments. For example, Nordhaus would switch between continuous and discrete time as if they were interchangeable, without explaining how or why he did so and confusing most of us in the process. There were also often grammatical mistakes that made the slides look sloppy and careless.\r\n\r\nNordhaus refused to disclose whether there would be a curve or not or to grant a system for students to request regrading of midterms. Our midterm grades were also not disclosed until THE DAY OF THE DROP DEADLINE at 4.45pm, so people trying to make important academic decisions where completely overwhelmed. \r\n\r\n I am honestly very sad that I could not take away much from this class at all, as I was genuinely excited to dive into it coming into the course and having enjoyed Introductory Macroeconomics. I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have this semester by Nordhaus. I can only hope whoever is reading this can flag the overwhelming negative feedback from these reviews youll be receiving. While Nordhaus might be an excellent scholar, this man should not be teaching students a required class in the major any longer. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very disorganized. The lecture notes and the readings from the textbook often had conflicting information, equations, tables, etc. The professor did not explain important topics well and often confused students more. The course needed an overview that linked all the separate topics together. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nordhaus stands as the greatest strength and weakness to this class, simultaneously.  He is an extremely knowledgeable scholar of macroeconomics with a tremendous history in the field.  However, occasionally, I found his teaching style to be difficult to follow and confusing.  This semester, he decided to try out a new teaching style in the form of substituting problem sets for in-class quizzes. At first, I was very excited for this, since it appeared to me as a way to reward students who come to class and engage with the material, but I ultimately found studying for these assignments to be difficult.  There was frequently a disconnect between the material that we were studying in class and what we were doing in the textbook.  Not necessarily a difference in substance, but in form, and in a way that made it difficult to know exactly what we needed to know for each quiz. ",
            "\u00a0The good thing about this course is that it has interesting information. I really appreciate the last p-set that we had. Instead of normal material, we analyzed the new Trump tax plan. That was a fabulous way to make this class applicable to the world outside of the university. \r\nHowever, there were certain things about this course that could use some change. The professor disagreed with most of our textbook. We had not one lecture that remained consistent with the $200 brand new textbook required for this course. The equations, theories, and graphs never aligned with the textbook. The book became incompatible with the course, which left it very difficult to study for exams. Moreover, we had four quizzes throughout the semester. It would have been more helpful if they were p-sets instead, as the quizzes caused a lot of anxiety. It felt like test week every week.\r\nMoreover, it was incredibly disorganized. What the professor said Monday, the TF would say differently on Tuesday. What the TF said Tuesday would disagree with the professor's update on Wednesday, and none of the opinions would be true in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs were wonderful resources, textbook was good, interesting lectures (but sometimes off-topic)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As described above, I felt that the lectures were always very interesting but sometimes didn't cover exactly the material we would be expected to know for the exam. ",
            "\u00a0The course was thought using a textbook that didn't follow the lectures closely (the different notation made it especially confusing). The lecture slides were rather superficial and spread out all over, which made them less helpful than they could have been. Quizzes were especially disorganized and carried out in an experimental fashion. All that could be improved upon. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't feel like the quizzes were useful in any way, the lecture slides could be a lot better and it would be super useful for the lecture and the textbook to use the same notation, solutions should be posted sooner and at more consistent time and dates. ",
            "\u00a0This class is run extremely poorly. The problem sets were released on Friday or Saturday and were due on Wednesday. The practice exams we were given to practice for our actual exams were of no help because they covered different material. We were forced to buy an extremely expensive book only to not ever use it because all of Nordhaus's notation was extremely different from the book's. And to top to off, the quizzes. Nordhaus decided he wanted to experiment with giving us a 15-minute quiz one week, and assigning a problem set the next. Although I do think the quizzes helped to keep us on top of the material, they were very poorly run. The timing was never right. Sometimes the quiz would be extremely easy and short and everyone would finish early, and other times it was too long and extremely difficult and no one knew what was going on or had time to think about it. A mess. Section was very helpful though, thank god for my TA. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this class was poorly coordinated. Between the lecture slides, in-class explanations, secrtions, textbook, and materials there was substantial disagreement on many topics, which made it hard to have a complete grasp of certain topics. While the overall themes of the unit were usually, it became increasingly difficult to apply one's knowledge with so much dissonance surrounding the specifics of the material. TAs were often unable to answer simple questions as a result, and the final exam was not at all representative of the course. Having said that, Professor Nordhaus is brilliant and teaches thoughtfully, and I did learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0As hard as I try, I cannot think of any strengths of this course.\r\n\r\nIt's weaknesses are plentiful. Prof. Nordhaus is among the worst lecturers I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. He consistently goes on tangents completely unrelated to the material. His communication with the TA's is abysmal. The material taught in lecture is entirely different from that taught in the textbook. This could be improved by moving more quickly through the material, spending less time in lecture explaining graphs that are very self-explanatory, and making clear how Prof. Nordhaus' lectures differ from the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot more real world content than the intro & intermediate micro sequence. My TA did a really good job explaining the maths behind the models, because Nordhaus skipped/did not clearly explain most of the maths (even though we got tested on it)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course was poorly organized in terms of content, as lectures sometimes skipped around. One concept would be briefly mentioned in one lecture, then resurface again later on. The textbook was not entirely helpful, as Nordhaus's lectures deviated from the models and maths used in the book, so it was unclear as to what to base our homework and tests on. Furthermore, the course did not provide clear instructions as to what we should be learning. There were no practice quizzes or finals, so it was unclear what exactly was going to be tested. Also, the psets attempted to push us in applying what we learned in class to homework, but instead since the in class content was so unclear, the psets weren't helpful either. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes were a nice addition ",
            "\u00a0I think much of the material is very interesting, however a problem I see with macroeconomics is that it is still a pretty underdeveloped field, and thus many inconsistencies. It was frustrating when lectures would deviate from the textbook. I also found it to be slightly unorganized at times, and certainly chaotic since it was such a large lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Exams not relevant to class material, TAs unhelpful ",
            "\u00a0It was hard to sit through lecture. While the professor is a great guy with a personality, he would often go off on tangents or just get through the material super, super slowly. Hard to stay focused. A lot of the material seemed pointless in lecture, and it was hard to tell what we would be tested on. I felt like during the time we had, we could've learned more, but he just went so slow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: terribly organized lectures, readings diverged often from what Nordhaus presented, sections were useless, quizzes were overly difficult, psets were graded harshly and points were docked for literally no reason. Nordhaus would then not entertain any point corrections. \r\n\r\nNordhaus is very intelligent, but this is a disastrous class. Intermediate macro had so much potential but it overcomplicated material that could have been easily grasped. Its not even because he was trying to be nuanced. Its that the class genuinely made some of the simplest concepts more confusing than they had to be for what appeared to be the sake of it. The quizzes were a terrible addition, and the midterm did not reflect anything taught in the class. Overall, poor. To provide examples, this class weirdly teaches AD-AS graphs with axes of Output and Inflation rather than Output and Price Level. Also, why did he not show us the regular demand-supply diagrams for exchange rates? It wouldve made conceptualizing the material so much easier. \r\n\r\nDisaster from start to finish. Literally left the last class halfway through to go eat  because I gave up on this. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect course. Genius professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to either follow a textbook closely, or disregard it and go by Nordhaus' own models. For each unit, we were presented with two different models - from the textbook and from lecture, and it was never clear which we were supposed to use and study. The course should have more problem sets and fewer quizzes, and more practice before midterms and exams - going into the midterm and exam, we had not seen any sample questions for many of the topics we had covered. Nordhaus spends a lot of time discussing real-world economics, which is interesting but detracts from our study of the economic theory. Because of this, I didn't come out of the course feeling like I had a comprehensive understanding of macroeconomics, but only of select topics like investment and international trade. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and the application of the models to current economical issues, like the Trump Tax Plan or the effect of robots on the workforce was incredibly insightful. The weakness of the class was the grading system which left me feeling that my grade was incredibly volatile throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course content could be conveyed more clearly, or with better organization. The fact, for example, that the distinction between output gap and gross output was never explicitly stated in lecture, all while we'd be switching continuously between the two in various versions of the IS curve, is bewildering. The combination of a fairly high number of models each with their own idiosyncratic \"simplifying\" assumptions and of a lack of transparency regarding when models were to be distinguished from each other/where they fit in overall made for an overally fairly confusing experience. \r\n\r\nJust as frustrating was the fact that the amount of \"variety\" or idiosyncrasy in the material was seemingly not for any increased accuracy but rather small mathematical simplifications here or there made the learning feel pointless. At the end of the day, the concepts conveyed were basic beyond belief, but so convoluted as to render my involvement in the course basically excruciating.\r\n\r\nAnother point: despite having spent so much time on these models and making slight and confusing tweaks to them, we spent little to no time talking about their limitations, their (empirical) justification, etc. Little effort was made, I felt, to the end of convincing me that what we'd been taught was little more than a lot of strange, mostly-linear equations dreamt up by an economist somewhere. Having had to spend so much time learning the stuff it would have been nice to be given some reason to actually believe in it.\r\n\r\nThat said, having established the models, it was really nice working through real life examples. I think the sessions on the new tax plan were very good---excepting the fact that again I had no way of gauging the extent to which I should believe the effects these models predicted. ",
            "\u00a0The course had great TA's but the mix of information from the book with Nordhaus' personal models was very confusing and the information was typically not organized very well in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Should not have quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Horrible class, extremely poorly taught. During reading period, he cracked jokes and seemed like he would be a helpful professor but little did I know that he would be exactly the opposite. Even though I will be getting a good grade, the professor taught horribly, going on tangents every few minutes and teaching historical details that would never be tested. The worst, most egregious part is that he would reach the math/model part of the lecture in the last 15 minutes of the 75-minute lecture, yet thats all that would be tested. Basically we never had any preparation/never did any similar practice problems to what was on the quizzes/exams. He also wouldnt give practice problems either; Ive never had a class where a practice exam with solutions wouldnt be provided before the midterm. He would give us a practice exam and say that because the course has changed, the questions wouldnt be relevant and so he wouldnt need to provide an answer key. Seriously that is the dumbest thing ever; I know he just didnt want to put any effort into helping us learn macro economics in his class. I couldve done just as well by not going to the lectures and just studying from my textbook. The TAs did their best to explain the material but also never went over specific math applications besides when we asked about the psets. Also, why is the final worth 50% of our grade? Especially considering we had 4 quizzes, 4 psets, and a midterm. Thats the most weight on the final of any course Ive taken at Yale. I would not recommend this course (this professor more specifically); it was my worst one this semester. ",
            "\u00a0While the material in the course was easy, the course itself was very disorganized. At points, it felt like there was nobody grading our problem sets and exams. The material taught in lectures contradicted the information in the book, which we were required to read. This made studying for exams for very difficult and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is definitely the organization and segmentation of the course material. The TFs are also decent, and I really enjoyed my TF as compared to the others. Professor Nordhaus made the lectures interesting and fun to attend. ",
            "\u00a0The classes weren't structured so that you could do well on problem sets and quizzes. The lectures seemed all over the place at time--albeit chock full of great info--making them hard to follow. I learned everything in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course material is interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The course is somewhat unorganized and expectations aren't clear. ",
            "\u00a0Nordhaus is funny and smart but he seems pretty uninvested from instructing this class. He mostly goes on a lot of tangents before squeezing the content. This is a shame because his insights get hidden in the odd pacing of class time.\r\n\r\nWE also did not get good feedback on psets and quizzes. I'd like answers and grading rubrics posted for assignments so I could have adjusted studying etc. to better meet the expectations of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fascinating stuff. In terms of content, probably the best ECON course I've taken so far, given how up to date things are (and I commend his effort).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the quiz format or organisation leaves a lot to be desired. Questions are simply maths based, but the problem is the maths he uses in lectures are frankly inconsistent given that he mixes assumptions.

This was understandably extraordinarily frustrating, when Nordhaus' slides had multiple different versions of formulas AND the textbook would have a different one. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the slides were confusing in the sense that most contained graphs that were difficult to interpret on their own in terms of both meaning and relevance, and were not well-explained in class. They were also hard to follow when reviewing for exams. \r\n\r\nI ended up learning most of the material in sectiondefinitely go to section! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I liked the implementation of quizzes because it allowed me to check my understanding and progress throughout the semester.\r\nWeakness: The grading was often wanton, and random points were docked for no reason. Also, the grading where only two questions are graded was also pretty unfair. ",
            "\u00a0A very interesting material but poorly organized. There was no practice material which made it a nightmare to prepare for exams. Problem sets were difficult to work on since TAs were not allowed to talk about them. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely the lectures and instruction  Professor Nordhaus is an amazing lecturer and I learned a lot from his instruction in class. He makes things very clear in class. My section was also very good which amplified the instructional value of this course. I learned a lot, and am really thankful for that.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course lie in logistics. We often werent given much time to prepare for quizzes (for the first quiz, the prep went up the night before the quiz). Also, TAs are apparently told that they cannot officially help with problem sets, and students have to work really hard to think of weird ways to ask their questions to get really confusing and ambiguous answers from TAs. I think this is bad, because students who are hard-working enough to have made a lot of progress on a Problem Set should be able to ask clear questions about their work and get clear answers. I also think we should have been given a full week to do the problem sets, not 3-4 days as we were given.\r\n\r\nA major issue to me was also the way quizzes were made. Some quizzes were too long for the 15 minute time we were supposed to have to do them  also, we werent allowed a calculator, but much of the math on them clearly could not be done in ones head or on paper. Since students were not told in advance that the math would be excessively difficult, we thought that, since the math wasnt working out, we must be doing the problem wrong. We, as a result, would spend too much time on the math and then not have enough time to consider other aspects of questions whose answers depended on solving the pretty much impossible math. I did appreciate that they were pretty understanding of this in their grading, but I wish the quizzes were prepared to better assess us on what we learned and the material we were responsible for.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the final might have been weighted too much. Any exam weighted 50% is, to me, very problematic. ",

I can only hope whoever is reading this can flag the overwhelming negative feedback from these reviews youll be receiving. While Nordhaus might be an excellent scholar, this man should not be teaching students a required class in the major any longer. I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have in this class.\r\n\r\nThe course was extremely poorly organized. We had 4 problem sets and 4 quizzes instead of the usual 8 problem sets format, which was a valid idea. We were given practice problems to prepare for the first quiz, but no solutions (which is standard in other STEM courses) - as a consequence, there was no way of knowing whether you were on track to grasping the material or not. When we requested solutions for the next quiz, Nordhaus  not only denied our request, but also decided to provide no practice questions at all. As a result, everyone felt completely blind walking into other quizzes.\r\n\r\nThe material covered in class was relatively straightforward, and Nordhaus clearly chose to focus on minor things he found more interesting rather than covering the more challenging problems (he was also often overly theatrical to the point it was counterproductive to learning). However, the problem was that the problem sets, quizzes, and midterms were MUCH more quantitative and asked of us we be extremely comfortable handling graphs, equations, and such. The class material covered in class did not equip us in the slightest to do this. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the slides regularly had typos and blatant mistakes in them that Nordhaus would take weeks to fix and repost on Canvas, and our TA had to spent time in section to highlight Nordhaus mistakes so we would not make errors in upcoming assessments. For example, Nordhaus would switch between continuous and discrete time as if they were interchangeable, without explaining how or why he did so and confusing most of us in the process. There were also often grammatical mistakes that made the slides look sloppy and careless.\r\n\r\nNordhaus refused to disclose whether there would be a curve or not or to grant a system for students to request regrading of midterms. Our midterm grades were also not disclosed until THE DAY OF THE DROP DEADLINE at 4.45pm, so people trying to make important academic decisions where completely overwhelmed. \r\n\r\n I am honestly very sad that I could not take away much from this class at all, as I was genuinely excited to dive into it coming into the course and having enjoyed Introductory Macroeconomics. I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have this semester by Nordhaus.

We do all the work and only half of it counts, it is maddening.  Seems just lazy on the TA's part.  As is the policy of no regrades.  It is not that hard to regrade things, and it is in fact the TAs' job to do so.  Hiding behind the guise of \"equality\" is just lazy, especially when the TAs will not regrade based on mistakes they made themselves.  It makes for a very unpleasant class. ",

Also, the alternating quizzes and psets was a great idea because it mixed things up and made us study everything for the quizzes rather than just doing the pset and putting the material aside. But, the quizzes weren't really gone over in section and if they were, they were reviewed long after the quiz when we were learning something totally different in class. Also, the exam reviews posted were COMPLETELY POINTLESS and didn't help with anything. The material wasn't the same so it would be better not to post them at all rather than pulling these random exams from online. But to be fair, the psets and quizzes were very good preparation for the exams, so they were still very fair. ",
            "\u00a0The prof is very funny, and class with him was more amusing then the average required econ lecture. \r\n\r\nTHAT BEING SAID, there were multiple issues with how Nordhaus ran his class:\r\n\r\n1) Nordhaus's lectures are useless when it comes to learning macroeconomics. The lecture slides often contain some models, or derivations, but Nordhaus rarely spent any time on those slides. Instead, he would talk about economics in politics, or an experience he had with the Fed that one time - WHICH IS INTERESTING - but also not at all helpful when you're being asked to learn how to optimize utility in a two period consumption model. On the rare occasion that Nordhaus would try to explain a model he would do so by drawing small graphs on the whiteboard. These graphs were A) really poorly drawn, with multiple erased lines and skewed axis and B) tiny. No one sitting further than the 5th row could understand them, and it was a ~200 person class. Could someone PLEASE get this man a projector board to write on or something, or better, assign a teacher who will actually teach.\r\n\r\nTo sum this up, Nordhaus never managed to teach us anything in lecture. My friends and I still showed up, out of the clinging hope that we'd learn something, but we'd always end up googling things, puzzling over the slides afterwards, or trying to read the textbook, leading me to:\r\n\r\n2) The textbook. In each lecture powerpoint, there was a slide dedicated to differences in the textbook's and Nordhaus's notation. R, k, J, r, etc. meant different things. The textbook also used different formulas then Nordhaus most of the time (For IS, MP, r, etc), and we needed to recognize both. It was suggested that we use a translation key one of the TFs had written if we read the textbook. A TRANSLATION KEY. Are you joking?! We are in a lecture with a man who has written several textbooks - one of them ON macroeconomics - and we need a translation key and countless supplemental readings to make ours actually apply to the material we're learning?! Sure, you could get theoretical ideas from the textbook, but good luck to you if you were trying to learn how the different models worked, even with your translation key. Now that we've covered the lectures and textbook, lets move on to a final point:\r\n\r\n3)Nordhaus implemented a policy that kept TF's from explaining the material we were supposed to be covering that week. To clarify, we had several psets and quizes throughout the semester, and during the week or two leading up to a pset or quiz, Nordhaus forbade TFs from going over material that was similar enough to the questions found on the current p-set or practice-quiz to possibly assist us with finishing it. \r\n\r\nOn a VERY theoretical level, I understand this practice - you certainly don't want to hand out answers. However, in practice, the TFs were so limited in what they could teach us that a lot of students never fully understood a lot of the more difficult concepts we were supposed to be learning.  For example: we would be given a p-set that covered several topics that had been introduced that week. Students worked on it on their own, then went to office hours to consult on concepts they didn't understand. TF's would be unable to explain any material even glancingly similar to that on the problem set, and could only resort to saying things like: \"You should maybe check chapter 12 of your text book, can't say exactly where, but something there might help you\" (that's a quote!) or \"All I can say is that you're over thinking things, that's all I can say\" (another quote!) or, my favorite: \"Just look at the answers to the pset when they're posted next week and that should explain it.\" Now, maybe, if Nordhaus's lectures actually taught students material, or the textbook could help them with models, these answers would be acceptable, but as previously discussed THEY DIDN'T. We were expected to learn from the ANSWER KEYs posted for the p-sets, which is pretty bad, even for this department. ",

What a joke. Nordhaus is the most apathetic professor I've ever seen, so deeply convinced he's the smartest person in the room that he barely actually teaches anything in class as its too basic and demands we teach ourselves through the textbook. However, he then tells us the information we learned in the textbook can be wrong and that we should follow what he says because he's right.

I will add that despite the lack of sophistication in the course content it felt like an extremely difficult class to do well in: the lectures didn't cover all the material we were expected to know, whatever it did convey was conveyed poorly, and the exam questions sometimes felt like they came out of nowhere. I will probably get better grades in classes with material orders of magnitude more nuanced/difficult and that is a fairly frustrating reality I know most Yale students would like to avoid.\r\n\r\nI think the course content could be conveyed more clearly, or with better organization. The fact, for example, that the distinction between output gap and gross output was never explicitly stated in lecture, all while we'd be switching continuously between the two in various versions of the IS curve, is bewildering. The combination of a fairly high number of models each with their own idiosyncratic \"simplifying\" assumptions and of a lack of transparency regarding when models were to be distinguished from each other/where they fit in overall made for an overally fairly confusing experience. \r\n\r\nJust as frustrating was the fact that the amount of \"variety\" or idiosyncrasy in the material was seemingly not for any increased accuracy but rather small mathematical simplifications here or there made the learning feel pointless. At the end of the day, the concepts conveyed were basic beyond belief, but so convoluted as to render my involvement in the course basically excruciating.\r\n\r\nAnother point: despite having spent so much time on these models and making slight and confusing tweaks to them, we spent little to no time talking about their limitations, their (empirical) justification, etc. Little effort was made, I felt, to the end of convincing me that what we'd been taught was little more than a lot of strange, mostly-linear equations dreamt up by an economist somewhere. Having had to spend so much time learning the stuff it would have been nice to be given some reason to actually believe in it.\r\n\r\nThat said, having established the models, it was really nice working through real life examples. I think the sessions on the new tax plan were very good---excepting the fact that again I had no way of gauging the extent to which I should believe the effects these models predicted. ",

I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have in this class.\r\n\r\nThe course was extremely poorly organized. We had 4 problem sets and 4 quizzes instead of the usual 8 problem sets format, which was a valid idea. We were given practice problems to prepare for the first quiz, but no solutions (which is standard in other STEM courses) - as a consequence, there was no way of knowing whether you were on track to grasping the material or not. When we requested solutions for the next quiz, Nordhaus  not only denied our request, but also decided to provide no practice questions at all. As a result, everyone felt completely blind walking into other quizzes.\r\n\r\nThe material covered in class was relatively straightforward, and Nordhaus clearly chose to focus on minor things he found more interesting rather than covering the more challenging problems (he was also often overly theatrical to the point it was counterproductive to learning). However, the problem was that the problem sets, quizzes, and midterms were MUCH more quantitative and asked of us we be extremely comfortable handling graphs, equations, and such. The class material covered in class did not equip us in the slightest to do this. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the slides regularly had typos and blatant mistakes in them that Nordhaus would take weeks to fix and repost on Canvas, and our TA had to spent time in section to highlight Nordhaus mistakes so we would not make errors in upcoming assessments. For example, Nordhaus would switch between continuous and discrete time as if they were interchangeable, without explaining how or why he did so and confusing most of us in the process. There were also often grammatical mistakes that made the slides look sloppy and careless.\r\n\r\nNordhaus refused to disclose whether there would be a curve or not or to grant a system for students to request regrading of midterms. Our midterm grades were also not disclosed until THE DAY OF THE DROP DEADLINE at 4.45pm, so people trying to make important academic decisions where completely overwhelmed. \r\n\r\n I am honestly very sad that I could not take away much from this class at all, as I was genuinely excited to dive into it coming into the course and having enjoyed Introductory Macroeconomics. I have never felt as cheated in my right to learn as I have this semester by Nordhaus. I can only hope whoever is reading this can flag the overwhelming negative feedback from these reviews youll be receiving. While Nordhaus might be an excellent scholar, this man should not be teaching students a required class in the major any longer. ",
            "\u00a0Its a required course, so you have to take it. But definitely take it with Nordhaus! Hes such an interesting guy. ",
            "\u00a0You take this because you have to.  Nordhaus is great, TA's and psets will be infuriating. ",
            "\u00a0The class in the fall is tall, blond and very athletic so you can imagine how the curve is like. Interestingly it was also full of overeager sophomores this year which was annoying. Nordhaus is fun to listen to but he's extremely disorganized and tends to go off on long tangents. Also he disagrees with at least half the textbook so that's fun when you're trying to study for exams as well, especially since his slide are full of errors. That said he's a pretty cool guy and lectures are entertaining. He also focuses a lot more on current events / actual macro as compared to Moscarini (who basically spent half a semester rederiving microeconomics). Workload was minimal - 4 psets which took no more than 2 hours and 4 quizzes - so that's another plus. ",
            "\u00a0If you're not an Econ major I'm not sure why you would take this and if you are.. you have no choice! ",
            "\u00a0Yes since it is a requirement and nordhaus is a decent lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I most certainly would! Professor Nordhaus is an unbelievable lecturer (funny, tons of stories/insider gossip!, clear, enthusiatic) and I really learned a lot. I'm more sure than ever that I want to pursue a career that is related in some form to economics and am even considering a more academic career because of Professor Nordhaus! ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take this course, and it's not that bad. I enjoyed most of the content and thought the course was of reasonable workload and difficulty. Just try to appreciate Nordhaus for his genius and not necessarily follow everything he says. ",
            "\u00a0This is a must-take if you want to understand the macroeconomy. ",
            "\u00a0Tough class ",
            "\u00a0not sure why the reviews for this course are so critical. i found this to be a great overview of macroeconomics, much more nuanced and in-depth than intro macro after the first three weeks. professor nordhaus is very entertaining and gives a fair look at the material. textbook and assigned readings are great. nothing life-changing, but a very good class and definitely worth taking if u need it or want to have a better understanding of economic policy. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in general macroeconomic principles, take this class. Some of the real-world examples we looked at were interesting, especially regarding monetary policy. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class, much better than intro macro, and significantly less work than intermediate micro. I'd recommend taking it with Professor Nordhaus. ",
            "\u00a0If you're majoring in Econ, you kind of have to take this, but it was a pretty underwhelming and dry class. Not really hard and the material is pretty straightforward, but there are much more interesting Econ classes out there that I'd rather take. Professor Nordhaus is really smart but his lectures don't really help in understanding the material a lot of the time. I ended up just reading the textbook, paying attention in section, and looking over his slides before exams. Sometimes he's really helpful but a lot of the time he just goes on tangents or talks about certain offshoots that we aren't tested on. ",
            "\u00a0Look, if you're an Econ major, then you're probably going to take this course, unless you want to tackle Macroeconomic Theory. \r\n\r\nIf you're not an Econ major - NO! Don't take this course! There are SO many more interesting, more strait-forward courses you should take.  \r\n\r\nIf you are an EP&E major and you're thinking, \"Hmm maybe I should take this course to get some more econ knowledge\" NO! Don't fall into that trap. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Take it f you must. Use the homeworks to guide your studying as Nordhaus lectures seem independent of the quizzes and exams, since that material is prepared by the TAs. Nordhaus is a lovely Professor and engaging lecturer but a bit disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0If you plan on taking Intermediate Macro - do take it with Prof. Nordhaus. As simple as that. He is simply the best econ professor I have ever encountered. The course covers interesting concepts and follows the textbook very closely. The lectures are fantastic (which is very rare for econ lectures), with Nordhaus offering his perspective on current and past events, econ policies etc. The only weakness is that the midterm and the final are hard to prepare for. There is no actual mock-test offered. ",
            "\u00a0Never if Nordhaus is teaching it. "
