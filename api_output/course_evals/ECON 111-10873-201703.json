            "\u00a0I got a basic understanding of the long-run and short-run basic economic models, as well as an understanding of the Great Recession (and how it disrupted our understanding of those models). ",

            "\u00a0The topics discussed were very interesting and a great follow up to Intro Micro. ",
            "\u00a0Small class size facilitates engagement and better retention of material ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great. Professor Amand is great at slowing down, re-explaining, or clarifying things when necessary. The quizzes and problem sets were useful in keeping me on task and up-to-date in the class. They reinforced my in-class learning. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Amand is super smart and teaches in a very clear, concise manner. He reviews the material frequently and makes super interesting real-world connections. I looked forward to going to class every day!!!! Whooo economics!!!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is fascinating because it allows time for you to go off on tangents in macroeconomics; I found this to be a little frustrating at times though - as we were unable to make it through foreign exchange rate. "

        [
            "\u00a0Good option to complete the intro economics series if you prefer smaller class size and more engagement with professor. Must be prepared to attend every class and participate. Although lecture slides are posted, significant material outside of the slides is covered in class and assessed on exams. ",
            "\u00a0Especially if you're choosing between this and the lecture, take this course. Professor Amand is a great professor, both in and out of the classroom. His office hours are helpful and having a class of 8 students really helps when you need to slow down and have material re-explained/clarified. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Take this course!!! It's phenomenal!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this macro class to people who were interested in macroeconomics but who found the lecture class for micro to impersonal.Best thing about this class - no section! "
