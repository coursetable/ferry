            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about human rights as a field in general (its history, current relevant topics, work presently being done in practice) and got to hear from many esteemed human rights speakers who are working in the field at present. Content was drier in the beginning when it was more background information, but the course got more interesting towards the end of the semester as guest speakers started coming. Nonetheless, as someone who came into the class not knowing to learn anything about the topic, I was alright with the \"dryness\" and found all the knowledge I learnt new and interesting. ",

I'm happy to say I learned a lot in this class. I learned how to scan different treaties and agreements between countries to find what they cover and what they don't, which is where countries are able to find loopholes. I also learned how to look through and even find different reports from NGOs to figure out the dynamics of a particular situation. ",

I feel like I now have a much stronger understanding of not only the theoretical roots of human rights, but of the contemporary politics and practices as well. ",

Each lecturer and reading introduced new human rights topics and different perspectives on each issue, allowing me to expand my understanding of the issues the world currently faces and how people think through certain human rights dilemmas. Through the discussion sections I also was exposed to my classmates' ideas and opinions and I learned how to argue for an idea I believed but also how to be open to new ideas. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: It provided a good overview of human rights as a broad topic; was interesting because of the guest speakers and great hearing directly from people who were practicing human rights in the field right now; a straightforward class with low workload (5 easy quizzes with the worse score dropped plus a final 10-15 page research paper)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dry, would be pretty boring for someone who already had experience in human rights topics ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was very repetitive and dry. Just reading from slides. Human Rights could be a very interesting and engaging lecture but it failed to live up to my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Content was interesting, but course did not go into depth about any case studies, which was disappointing.  Would suggest, after the introductory portion of the course, studying far fewer topics (maybe one case study per week) and going into much greater detail about the relevant rights & issues in realizing them for each study. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be organized differently (more chronologically) and I think that there should a midterm in addition to the quizzes. I also think that we should read more philosophy/theory. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely needs a better structure and more engaging content. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a really good survey one; it covers a variety of topics throughout the semester and offers different perspectives on issues. The paper at the end is great, because you're able to choose a topic (including one not covered specifically in class) and pretty much have free reign to write about it. I would say one weakness were some weeks in section, not because of the section TAs, but because of activities planned for certain weeks. Sometimes we would have interactive activities/simulations that would be interesting and unique, but wouldn't really relate to what was happening in lecture or on the quizzes. It would have been more helpful to have discussion on the readings, as those were on the quizzes, so maybe limit the amount of simulation activities or have the activities material be on the quizzes would be helpful. Also, the guest lectures were a highlight of the course, but at times the guest lectures would be formatted differently from the regular lectures. It would be difficult to take notes during these lectures, but the material would still be on the quizzes, so limiting the amount of guest lectures (especially toward the end of the semester) would be helpful, or maybe making a standardized powerpoint guidelines would help, so the guest lecturers would be able to talk about what they want, but students would also have a reference point for the quizzes as well. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good at giving background knowledge on a subject most people haven't studied before. Sometimes the information given seemed irrelevant though. Also some of the get speakers weren't really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was very nice to get to experience different guest speakers, but that said I think this course needs to be more cohesive. It definitely seemed like we were just jumping around from topic to topic without any real fluidity, so it was difficult to get one direct narrative throughout the course. I did like the structure of having five quizzes and I hope the instructors continue to make the quizzes more open-ended. ",
            "\u00a0Lecturers are very strong. Slides can be less technicality based and more insights based ",
            "\u00a0The guest lectures are both a strength and a weakness. They offer insights that go beyond the readings and class material. However, when there was not a set outline, the lecture would be difficult to follow at times.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes were rote memorization for the first couple ones, which was not particularly telling of my understanding of the course material. When the questions became more open-ended in later quizzes, I felt like I was better able to demonstrate what I knew and actually analyze the course material. I also appreciated that we could drop one quiz as they then became less stressful. I would only suggest that we have 25 minutes to complete them instead of 20.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were informative and I liked that they were posted on Canvas so we could review them for the quizzes.\r\n\r\nThis class covered many topics but only at a surface level. We could have explored some of the topics more in-depth. The subject material is really interesting but could have been presented in a more engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. I think it is a great survey course into the world of Human Rights, and I look forward towards taking more advanced classes in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was a stronger integration with the theory and politics of human rights. It appeared to me that for certain topics, the class only addressed either the theory or the policies, but not usually both. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn about interesting examples and theoretical principles. \r\nWeaknesses: Some readings are boring legal writings, and you leave questioning how practical human rights truly are. ",
            "\u00a0Too many different speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting discussion sections and guest lecturers, interesting (and widely varied) readings, not too heavy of a courseload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes lectures (and quizzes) focused too heavily on basic facts and wrote memorization at the expense of more in-depth analysis and understanding of debates and interpretations of human rights concepts ",
            "\u00a0Learnt a lot of details about the way the UN works and major human rights issues - comprehensive introduction to the topics. \r\nWish we had spent more time discussing the theory behind human rights and more real life examples. \r\nThe quizzes were really easy but they were very content based- did not test learning in an effective way (just memorization skills). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\nClass format: Posting the lecture slides onmine allows students to focus on the lecture instead of worrying about writing down notes. Everything on the quiz was from the lectures, so you just had to go over the lecture slides to prepare for the quizzes. \r\n\r\nGuest Speakers: The best part of this class were the many guest speakers! Each guest speaker came from a distinguished line of work within the field of human rights. It was great being able to hear about their first hand experience and connecting it to in-class lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is that it had really amazing speakers come in who provided us with real life examples of human rights. A weakness would be how much of a survey course it is. It would also help if the mechanistic parts of how the UN works were explained less in theoretical terms and, instead, were explained through real life examples. ",
            "\u00a0Was an overview class so didn't get in as much depth as I would've liked but that's the nature of an introductory class. Sections were great. ",
            "\u00a0Guest speakers were excellent!! I would have loved less of the introductory material and more specific human rights violation thematic case studies. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes started off too narrow which meant students lost a lot of marks, but they amended them and worked perfectly after that ",
            "\u00a0I like how the course was separated into different units. Its organisation allowed us to focus on each area every week. I also enjoyed listening to all the guest speakers. It would be nice, however, if one class discussed how all the areas of human rights are interlinked. ",
            "\u00a0It felt a little mechanical at times, the structure was so predictable that the value of lectures was lessened. Quality of classes also depending on the guest speaker. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it gives students a very broad base of knowledge about human rights in practice and in theory. The weakness that inevitably accompanies this strength is that I often felt we had inadequate time to do each topic justice. I also felt that some of the guest speakers' lectures were not well matched with the aims of the course. In addition, the lengthy readings were often summarized by the lecturers in class, making it so that many students did not feel the need to read them. The level of preparation expected in section was much higher than that expected for lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Good as a survey course, but I wish we went a little bit more in depth on everything. I wish class had a more critical lens rather than a descriptive one. ",
            "\u00a0This was an introductory human rights course, and as such, each class focused on a different topic of human rights. Exposing students to issues of older persons' rights, women's rights, refugee rights, and more is a strength of the course because it allows students to learn about many different human rights dilemmas the world faces and perhaps find a subject that they are interested in. I also enjoyed being able to hear different lecturers' perspectives on these topics.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course was titled \"Human Rights Theory and Politics\" and although we were taught about the theory of human rights, we did not really dive into the politics. In such a broad introductory course it would be too difficult to examine both the theory AND the politics. Therefore I recommend that in future iterations of this course, the organizers focus solely on the theory and philosophy that informs political theorists and human rights thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0Since this is a survey course, it gives very basic and general exposure to the material without going in depth about any particular topic. I found the presentation of material, both in lectures and in readings, to be dry. It's all about statistics, legal language, and powerpoints, and the emotional/anecdotal dimension of human rights is really lacking. Guest lectures were sometimes interesting, but most lectures felt uninspiring and systematic. While I learned a lot about the human rights systems and how they operate, most of my engagement involved memorization, as opposed to a more critical evaluation of these systems. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might have even a sligjr interest in human rights. I took it because I wanted to know how the UN and other international institutions operate, and I ended up learning not only that but also so much about specific issues like refugee rights and environmental rights that really challenged my worldview. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if the reason why you are doing this course is because you do not know anything about human rights and are interested in learning about the content knowledge associated with the topic. This class provides good overview of background knowledge/facts - however, if you want an intellectually stimulating, riveting class with no \"dryness\", this is probably not the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Eh. I took it because I was interesting in HR but the class was disappointing. Everything from the class could be read online in maybe four or five hours. There were no life-changing concepts or ideas, just very straightforward. I would pass. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it's really easy and lord knows some of us need some easy classes to help our transcripts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It's required for Human Rights scholars, so I had to take it, but I definitely would have taken it regardless. The class is so important especially in this day and age, where people talk a lot about human rights, but few people are aware of what that means. The course goes over the structure of the UN, international criminal court, what human rights actually are, and different treaties just to name a few topics. Professors Sanchez and Ezer are both really great lecturers and open to questions and helping out students. The class also isn't capped, but it never felt like there were too many people in the room. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a class you should take if you are interested in human rights/social justice at all because it gives you the knowledge you need to be educated on these subjects. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class! Even though some of the preliminary topics about human rights and the UN architecture weren't the most interesting, hearing from experts working in different fields in human rights was certainly worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Sure! If you have a materialist interpretation of the world you probably won't like it, and my own leanings left me feeling like a lot of the ideas we talked about were neoliberal crumbs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But be prepared to be rightfully unfulfilled ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you are even remotely interested in human rights. Though the course itself can be a bit broad and not very in-depth at times, the final paper gives you a lot of opportunity to go more in-depth in your particular area of interest. Also, if you can get Paul as a TF, do it! He is the best. ",
            "\u00a0maybe ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course. Its VERY straightforward. No tricks on the quizzes or unclear information. The lectures are great and cover both the theories surrounding human rights and modern accounts of human right violations. The guest speakers give interesting and relatable information about human rights in their different fields. Overall amazing course which has made me want to potentially pursue new opportunities in protecting human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to another student. However, you will truly get what you put in. Also, be aware that it is very much an intro survey course so if you already have a working knowledge of this topic then you might not enjoy it as much. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very relevant course. It was unclear to me how human rights actually work--how do nonprofits promote human rights, what does the UN do, etc. and i think this course helped me understand a lot of the more practical, complicated processes behind it. If you're thinking about a career in human rights this is a good class to take. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a fifth credit or a simplified introduction to human rights, this is the perfect course for you! ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course and felt that it gave me an adequate base of knowledge to continue studying human rights in the future. I would recommend this class to a friend who is interested in studying human rights further. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student! It is important for students to understand contemporary issues that our nation faces especially, and this course did an excellent job of providing a broad overview of the history of human rights and current issues. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this if you're looking for a basic introduction to human rights systems, documents, practices, and issues. It's designed to be a cursory overview of human rights, and it does that fairly well. If you're hoping to be inspired or energized in lecture, though, this isn't the class for you. ",
