            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about issues in Ancient Chinese history and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Read a TON of old Chinese stuff (sorry for the nebulous term). Excerpts from: The Odes, the Documents (both of which are Classics of Zhou), the Zuozhuan (commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals), the Analects (Confucius), the Mengzi (Mencius), the Xunzi (not sure of his Romanized name), Zhuangzi (Chuang Tsu), Laozi/Daodejing (Lao Tsu/Tao Te Ching, and we read all of it), Han Feizi, Mozi, the Annals of Lu Buwei, the Seven Stimuli, the Yi Jing/Classic of Changes (I Ching), the Records of the Grand Historian, Classic of Filial Piety, Canon of Yao and Shun, and probably more that I'm missing. Developed a pretty good sense of what each of these documents stood for/argued, good idea of the themes and concepts explored in each of them. Good idea of opinions on how to rule/serve. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to take poetic philosophy more serious. Or at least I think I have a better set of tools to analyze it more critically before potentially dismissing it as nonsensical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0-how to go about reading ancient texts\r\n-how to analyze/discuss those texts in class, papers ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me an excellent working foundation of knowledge in a canon of texts and in a culture I had never before studied. What's more, we had many fascinating discussions about not merely these texts' content but also their form, motivations, authorship, and their purpose in constructing or deconstructing a ruling ideology. In other words, it deepened my critical thinking skills when it comes to reading not just what a text says but also why the text exists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ancient Chinese religious, political and Philosophical thought in this course. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of some of the major themes that Ancient Chinese thinkers wrote about. The political histories that informed those views. Different opinions from different thinkers. What to look for when reading an Ancient Chinese Text. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me knowledge of the ancient Chinese intellectual tradition, and developed my skills in critically analysing Chinese philosophy, both as texts in and of themselves and as a canon of texts that stand in relation to each other. The course allows you to read great Masters and works of ancient China, many, or even all, of which have legacies that make them relevant and eminent today in China and the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course is heavily text-based, which means you get very, very good at teasing out the finer details of a text -- not just the content or the phrasing of it, but also the dynamics of translation, the importance of form, and the problem of authorship. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: definitely the high expectations of students. We all propped each other up, I think, in terms of encouraging each other to read closely/think critically about the texts. Prof Hunter is also good at leading discussion -- knows when to give mini-lectures with background, when to take a back seat, when to lead us away from less useful discussion. The class became fairly close throughout, which was also pretty cool.\r\nWeaknesses: the tuesday-to-thursday turnaround for some readings was pretty difficult. I also felt like the two halves of the course had really different feels (first half was mostly Master texts, second half having the almanacs, histories, more culture/life aspects) and that, coupled with my being way more interested in the Master texts, made the second half of the course kind of a slog (some people probably felt the exact opposite, though). But I do want to stress that these weaknesses are really minor, and most of the problem came from me! (So, the course may have been weak in these areas for me/someone like me, but I don't want to say that it was weak in these areas generally.) ",
            "\u00a0I like the small class size. you really engage with the material, your peers, and the professor. I loved and hated that professor Hunter made us write a discussion post on Canvas due the day before class.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it really forced you to do the reading...or at least read enough of it to make an intelligent post.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it made the class more time consuming because you actually had to do a lot...a lot...of reading. It's not easy reading 50 pages of some gibberish-sounding text and then writing why it's significant and academic. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an great mix of lecture and discussion.  I appreciated how the class focused mostly on the material itself rather than on existing interpretations of the material.  The writing assignments were a good way to engage with the readings. \r\n\r\nFor someone without background in ancient Chinese anything, the course sometimes felt a little disjointed / lacking in context.  This is perhaps also due to the nature of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The readings in and of themselves are quite interesting, but what's most valuable about the course is Professor Hunter's teaching ability. He's one of the best discussion-leaders I've had at Yale, and he's talented at moderating our conversations, putting pressure on certain viewpoints (whether they are ours or certain academic views on the texts we're discussing), and giving us a strong foundation to understand these complex readings. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of those complex readings, I think the course would benefit from diversifying its paper assignments. It would have been nice to have written mid- or full-length paper, whether in lieu of one or some of the two-page response papers or in lieu of one of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course, though it is technically a lecture is structured more around reading texts and having discussions about them in class, which is very helpful for understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hunter is greater, class discussion was interesting, the syllabus was clearly put together with a lot of thought, readings were well chosen.\r\nCan't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hunter's lectures were clear and illuminating, a great way to start each class. The reading responses we uploaded before every class, and the short papers we wrote, were particularly helpful in allowing us to synthesise our thoughts and consolidate our impressions of each reading. The class atmosphere also was, for some reason, warmer and more collaborative than most classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Hunter was also patient and his teaching style kept the class exceptionally engaged. A possible area of \"improvement\" is perhaps in class discussion, to encourage the class to focus even more on the language of the text (though Professor Hunter already did this to an extent), as occasionally, our class discussions would be driven by individualised responses not always supported by the text itself. It would also have been fascinating to train a more explicitly literary or philosophical eye on the works we read: i.e. think even harder about what makes these texts so great literarily or philosophically, for instance, by analysing the language or literary devices used, or by looking at what it means for a text to be a work of philosophy in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0This course really excelled in its seminar-style, in addition to the occasional crash-course history lectures necessary to understanding the historical context of it. The organization of the texts and how we read them can be a bit confusing, but that's something we discussed at the end of the semester as well. "

            "\u00a0Take it! You'll read a bunch of stuff that you might never read on your own, and you'll read it in a way that you will almost certainly never read in on your own. My class became fairly close, so that's another boon. Prof Hunter gets lunch with students all the time, too, and he's really cool.\r\nHowever, this is a good course to Cred/D. I took it mostly as a self-help course (if Confucius says I ought to reflect thrice daily, I probably will) and so the first half of the course (Master texts like the Analects, Laozi, Zhuangzi, etc.) was super fun and useful, but the second half (more histories, almanacs, a divination manual) was less so. Also, the essays are pretty tough, but not so if you're Cred/D. I will say that if you do take it Cred D, tell Prof Hunter! I didn't and I'm sure he thought I was a dolt. ",
            "\u00a0yes, i would recommend it. I came in thinking i knew a little bit of ancient Chinese thought. i didn't really. Halfway through the course I thought all of what we were reading was useless nonsense. But then towards the end i think I was appreciating our material in a way only possible after taking this class. I recommend it because it's important to learn how to think differently, how to analyze in a different way than you are used too with say Wuthering Heights ",
            "\u00a0I took this course with no background in Ancient Chinese Thought and hardly any existing knowledge of philosophy in general.  I would definitely recommend any student to take this class.  The readings can be wonderful to engage with academically and personally, and the class itself is well organized and well taught. ",
            "\u00a0I came to this class without any background in ancient China or modern China and without knowing what to expect. I loved it. The texts themselves are rich and interesting, but the value comes from Professor Hunter himself. He is one of the finest discussion-leaders I've had at Yale. I also enjoyed how much the class deepened my critical thinking skills, a benefit that came mainly from how much we discussed not merely the contents of the readings but their form, the author's motivation in writing it, and--on that note--the thorny question of authorship in this canon of works.\r\n\r\nGrading is fair, but the exams are comprehensive and the two-page papers can test you. You'd benefit from thinking about which readings will have which IDs as early in the course as possible. I also think the class would benefit from at least one mid- to full-length essay.\r\n\r\nTake it! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. You cover a lot of excellent and important material, and I think my critical thinking/reading skills grew from the way Hunter pushes people during class discussions. Generally speaking, I thought the class was led and organized extremely well. The class has frequent reading responses and short papers but no longer assignments, which I personally think is great--it forces you to engage with the material consistently and is less stressful. The readings are hard, but Hunter is thoughtful about how much he assigns. Also, go to lunches with the professor! So fun! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to others. The material was very interesting, the professor (prof. Hunter) is super knowledgable and interesting, and engagement in the class was high.\r\n\r\nThis class isn't difficult by any means, but it is a steady amount of work. There are two short reading responses a week, 4/5 longer ones that are called 'short papers' throughout the semester, in addition to the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0I highly highly recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might generally be interested in the subject matter. I had taken a few other philosophy/intellectual history courses in the Western cannon which I loved  but taking this course gave me new topics to think about and a new perspective on the original topics. Professor Hunter is a great professor: he assigns well-chosen readings, creates interesting discussions in class, and has theories that will change the way you look at the works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The ancient Chinese intellectual tradition is as exceptional as the Western intellectual tradition, and is an entire field majestic on its own. It is a great academic experience to learn about key works in a breathtaking tradition, and to see how Chinese thought unfolded in such a powerful civilisation. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course enough! Its a super accessible class for people with absolutely no background in ancient China, philosophical/intellectual thought, or the intersections thereof. Professor Hunter excels at lecturing AND nudging seminar discussions in a productive direction, and the questions we interrogate while reading the texts are all fundamental principles that everyone can generally relate to. \r\n\r\nFor people choosing between this class and EALL 200: The Chinese Tradition, take this class if you are more interested in pursuing readings in-depth and with a more sharply critical eye. EALL 200 offers more of an overview/crash course/Cliff Notes version of the Chinese literary tradition, whereas this class grapples much more with the texts, ideas, and interpretations. "
