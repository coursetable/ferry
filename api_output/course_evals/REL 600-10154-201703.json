            "\u00a0Austin (Charles) was fantastic. He was always thoroughly prepared, was an excellent facilitator of conversation, and was always helpful in clarifying and summarizing what had been covered in class lectures or readings. Section was my favorite part of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Charles was a great TF. He was very organized, timely, and knowledgeable. He is very good at lecturing and  explaining various topics and a range of ideassections were always engaging, and I got a lot out of our class together on these days. ",
            "\u00a0mr. rivera did a good job of reinforcing the most important points of the weeks lecture. he is a bit of a tough grader, perhaps a bit more tough than he needed to be for sure - but fair. good classroom temperament. he did not play favorites and was great at getting the class to participate. ",
            "\u00a0I felt Austin was a great TA. He created a really good environment of discussion within the section, and addressed the issues we read about in a very helpful manner. As many of the readings were from different time periods, he helped to synthesize them into a coherent whole that helped us to understand why each piece was picked to read. He also made an environment that allowed for open discussion of the issues, which I really appreciated. I don't have any criticism for the way he conducted our section meetings. ",
            "\u00a0He knows the material and he's laid back, which is nice.\r\n\r\nHe is a terrible grader. He often deducted points that didn't make sense, he barely commented on papers, and his handwriting is illegible, if indeed you received the kinds of comments that indicated where you went wrong, be it thesis, content, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal. A master of the content of the course and always willing to help us walk through areas that we found ourselves stuck in. ",
            "\u00a0He was great at facilitating discussion and helping us to make connections between the readings. I appreciated the way he did so on the board. ",
            "\u00a0Austin has been a really good TF throughout the semester. He has offered a setting in which we could discuss, talk, and share our thoughts and ideas. I do appreciate his works. ",
            "\u00a0Charles is a warm, mild-mannered but friendly TF, who obviously cares a lot about theology and the implications it has for our lives. I felt I learned a lot from him, and felt encouraged and had my interest piqued throughout the semester with him. ",
            "\u00a0Austin was a great asset to the course. He let us find our own voice as we worked through often difficult theological texts, and he brought a prayerful presence into the room that helped us remember why we were doing what we were doing. ",
            "\u00a0Charles (Austin) is intelligent, organized, calm and kind. His sections were thoughtful and thorough. I would have liked a bit more detailed feedback on papers, as I've been out of school a while and was not always sure how to improve-but I could have sought him out.  I always looked forward to section. ",
            "\u00a0It was very helpful for us to track thoughts and concepts across the various authors. The way we compared and contrasted viewpoints in class while talking about the readings made them easier to understand. I think section was a useful tool in order to provide additional perspective that me may not have gotten in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Austin was a very good section leader. I appreciated his guidance. He helped our section develop our perspectives on theology and cultivated a supportive learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Charles/Austin was kind, engaging, and an effective facilitator of discussion. He efficiently raised questions and incorporated students into the development of ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nadapted to the course and section needs \r\nresponded to emails quickly\r\nwas available to meet outside of section \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nit seems that this is a little outside her expertise and she did not always thoroughly understand the material \r\nshe offered little insight and interpretation of theological concepts and readings ",
            "\u00a0Section started off a little rough; it didn't have much direction initially.  However, Cody was really responsive to feedback and after the first session or two, sections were really great, discussion was lively and they really helped work through the material.  She was also really patient and responsive to the many emails we sent about assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Cody is not a theologian, which was both her greatest strength as a TF and the source of her weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0interactive \r\nrespectful \r\nengaging ",
            "\u00a0Cody was a very excellent listener and eager to be a student with us in our sections. She encouraged us to freely dialogue about what we had taken away from lecture, and she was eager to let us probe any issues that we found interesting. She was an extremely responsive grader with interest in students' choices as scholars, and she took the assignments we turned in seriously and gave excellent feedback. She was also happy to share any knowledge she had gleaned as a divinity student herself. \r\n\r\nCody is a religious studies scholar by trade, and this theology class seemed not to be a good fit for the kind of knowledge she had to provide and guide the class. Oftentimes, she would sit silently in discussion as we moved it wherever we thought it should go. At times, it seemed like she was unsure how to take the leadership role of the class, and whether this was an intentional pedagogical offering to us to be able to explore or part of her journey moving through her first TA position was unclear. She will definitely benefit from aiding a class more aligned with her field, better organized to meet its instructor, and with a little more experience under her belt. ",
            "\u00a0My TF was great at helping digest the vast amount of theology covered in this course. Her comments on graded written work were great. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the feedback Cody provided on our writing assignments. I also appreciated how prompt she was in answering clarifying questions about assignments. \r\n\r\nI felt that she could have facilitated section discussion more assertively by asking follow-up questions on students' comments. ",
            "\u00a0Cody is a kind person who is easy to talk to about the material. However, she was learning much of the material alongside us and so was not able to give us any guidance or clarification past a discussion of our ideas. \r\n\r\nThere seemed to be little to no communication between the professor and the TFs prior to sections to prepare them for the week's topics or to go over the expectations for the writing assignments. Cody often did not know how to clarify for us the vague prompts and would often tell us something was okay to do and then grade us harshly for that very thing on that same assignment after it was turned in. The vagueness of the prompts mixed with this vagueness of communication between the professor, the TFs, and us made grading often seem unclear at best and unfair at worse. ",
            "\u00a0Cody seemed to be somewhat in over her head with this class - the section was equally student-led and TF-directed. Requirements for papers were not often clear, and even in feedback for our final papers the way many people in the class understood the prompt and how it was graded was not consistent.\r\n\r\nShe was very kind and always willing to engage students in discussion about their paper topics and what we'd read, but those conversations didn't always translate into papers. ",
            "\u00a0Cody's suggestions for the assignment were very helpful. Cody is knowledgeable and she always wanted to encourage us to think deeply and to be open-minded. ",
            "\u00a0Austin was a great teaching fellow and really helped everything through the readings and assignments. His biggest strength, at least in this class, is that he breaks often complex material or assignments into steps that made both more easy to swallow. He was also readily available outside of class to, which was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Cody's feedback on all assignments were extremely helpful. She was available outside of class for extra help and to answer questions, if needed. She was encouraging during section. Over the course of the semester, she also found more creative and engaging ways to structure section, which helped our group discussion improve. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Available \r\n-Honest about her strengths and weakness \r\n-Understanding \r\n-Gave space to students to raise difficult questions \r\n-Built a safe space for discussion and good group dynamic \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Strict grader, to improve: to be less harsh in detraction of points\r\n-Not always confident in her leading of the group, to improve: be assertive ",
            "\u00a0Cody is a nice TA. She respects everyone's opinion and encourages our utterance in the section. She always replies timely to our online question and gives insightful and suggestive comments to our paper.\r\nShe could follow more closely on the professor's idea in the class and answers to our questions in understanding the professor.
