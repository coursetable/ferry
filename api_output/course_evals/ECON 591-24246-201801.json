            "\u00a0I think this is the well-organized course. Especially, lecturer Gaurav's clear explanations for applied analysis were excellent. In addition, I learned a lot from external lecturers who came from MIT, Yale SOM etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! One of my favorites this semester. I learnt so much and pushed myself to really engage with the course material. Strengths include Gaurav (who is a really great teacher), the types of studies we evaluated (which were really interesting), and the guest lectures. I can't think of any weaknesses other than I wish we had worked more with STATA. I think the first problem set could have been a STATA problem set, and then the second problem set could have pushed our skills even further by asking us to do a longer STATA coding project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - strong focus on empirical understanding and writing a critical response to papers included in the syllabus. Presenting papers in a seminar style talk was also a great way to engage students and learn about recent, relevant papers. Organizing guest sessions was also a great aspect of this course because it gave us an understanding of what certain researchers in the field are doing.\r\nWeaknesses - Literally, nothing. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the topics covered are very interesting, useful and they had a very applied focus. The professor is great, and the assignments were interesting and helped us understand better the concepts covered in class.\r\nWeaknesses: having 3hours of class is tough, although it makes sense due to the structure of the course. But maybe having class twice per week would be better. ",
            "\u00a01 Reading Assignment helped me to familiarize myself with various papers. \r\n2 The assignment related to DID (Indian bicycle program) enabled us not only to understand but also to implement DID. ",

",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Low number of assignments made it easy to fall behind in class and then stressful when we did have an assignment due. Adding more assignments (each worth a smaller % of total grade) would have worked better for me. Also, I'm not really sure this class is very useful unless you are planning to go into a development economist role. Unless you need to understand what development economists due in your adjacent role. \r\n\r\nIn class, I wish we had talked about more papers related to each development topic. It would have been useful to see what the consensus is among development economists regarding the successes of different development projects and what aspects contribute to their successes. It felt too piece-meal for me to get a sense of best practices in the sphere. \r\n\r\nGrading criteria was very vague. Instructor gave almost no specifics about how assignments would be graded, then graded very stringently. Maybe we just have a different definition of what a good grade is? I felt blindsided by how poorly I did on a few pieces of final grade. I haven't felt that in any other graduate school classes. \r\n\r\nStructure of: first half of course discussing economic tools/methods, second half discussing papers that use each method, made it easy to forget how the tool worked when we went to read the papers. Maybe the structure should be: discuss a tool one class, read papers that use it the next class, and so forth. ",

            "\u00a0I honestly just didn't understand the course content enough before I decided to take the class. A development economics theory class would have been much more useful for me than a methods class, because I was trying to see whether I wanted to pivot to studying more developing country issues and what the main success factors are for development projects. Compare this course to other IDE courses before you decide to take it. If you're not in the IDE program, make sure you understand regression pretty well. Although an understanding of some of the theory the course gets into wasn't necessary to get a good grade, it felt like a good chunk of the course content went over my head, which is a shame because graduate school for me is a lot more about what I am learning from classes over grades. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in trying out a course to see if international/development issues are what you want to work in, do a course at Jackson then maybe dive deeper into the econ side of things with an IDE course if its a fit.
