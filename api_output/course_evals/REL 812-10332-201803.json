            "\u00a0Very pastoral. Great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. LaSala was able to create a very safe space that allowed the students to discover and experiment with the preaching assignments. Her comments were very thoughtful.  She also was able to share her own relevant experiences and resources. ",
            "\u00a0Julie made what could have been a stressful situation into a pleasure. She showed us how to be supportive of each other in this vulnerable space of preaching to peers. ",
            "\u00a0Julie Kelsey not only professes wonderful pastoral acumen but she also really cares for her students. She brings skill, compassion, and excitement every day. With Julie, it is very easy to remember that preaching is a product of prayer. ",
            "\u00a0strength:engaging, emtional support  and understanding , give instant instrution. \r\n\r\n\r\nweakness is  less structured on how we should comment on other sermon, i saw other subgp have a guideline table to follow on giving comments. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Streets kept our section truly focused on the students preaching each week. He provided feedback on each sermon that was meaningful, and he shepherded us through various stages of our work with intention. He was a positive presence in our classes, and he was interested primarily in affirming our voices and figuring out how we could deliver nuanced points. He didn't shy away from critiques, but they were always combined with meaningful support. I appreciated the space that he held for each student to voice their work and then to contribute ideas to other students about their work. \r\n\r\nHe was not excellent at time management, and he had many other obligations throughout the semester. We often were not kept up to date with the syllabus, classes sometimes ran out of time, preaching dates were changed, etc etc. It would have been wonderful if the calendar had been kept very clear. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent facilitator! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly kind, genuine, listened and provided feedback well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could be more critical of the work we were doing instead of only praising ",
            "\u00a0Kind, great at giving encouragement along with constructive criticism, excellent at fostering discussion and engagement within our preaching section ",
            "\u00a0Kind, supportive, carefully delivered constructive criticism ",
            "\u00a0Very positive and created a welcoming environment. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated Tom Long's criticisms and lessons - I think that he definitely had a lot to offer students and really was able to focus in on specific areas in our preaching section. Sometimes, it  definitely felt as maybe there was a difference in who was receiving more criticism than others. I can't point out anything specific, but there was a clear distinction between some student preachers and others. ",
            "\u00a0Julie was a fantastic section leader. She really helped foster a trusting and helpful group environment in which we could preach with confidence and also know that people would be honest in their assessment of the sermons. Julie was a big part in the creation of this environment, and offered helpful insight herself on our sermons. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge, caring, encouraging and absolutely wonderful ",
            "\u00a0- I appreciated the way Maria led the section. She started with prayer and was mindful of constructive criticism. \r\n- Maria was readily available to meet outside of class/section time to provide guidance and answer questions.\r\n- Marias feedback on assignments was helpful. It may be even more so if it were given closer to the when the assignment was completed.\r\n- There were a couple of times where student comments were not helpful, maybe borderline hurtful, and it may be helpful for Maria to have some responses ready for when these occur. I realize that there is no way to predict when these might occur so that may be a difficult suggestion to implement. \r\n- I recommend asking Maria to serve as a practicing instructor again. I will be using her as a resource for my future preaching. ",
            "\u00a0She was very focused on our section giving positive feedback, which was nice, but I think having some constructive criticism from my peers would have been helpful, too. ",
            "\u00a0Maria was a fantastic section leader. The section was the highlight of this class, and one of my highlights of YDS. The thing I appreciated most about Maria is that she made space for both constructive critique and encouragement. Sappy and sentimental encouragement is helpful to no one at the end of the day, and Maria modeled more meaningful engagement with our work. She gave sincere compliments and offered gentle constructive feedback. It was also clear that she cared about each of his emotionally, and really wanted us to be the best spiritual versions of ourselves. I'm very thankful I ended up working with her. ",
            "\u00a0Julie created a warm and encouraging classroom setting where we could engage with each other's work. In an academic institution where we are so often encouraged to think about how we are not good enough, Julie consistently lifted up what we did well, and listened to us when things were hard.\r\n\r\nA challenge of such an atmosphere, ironically, was that it sometimes made it harder to ask questions about things we weren't certain worked in our sermons, or to feel we could say when something *hadn't* been successful in a peer's preaching. My impression is that some of this constructive criticism came out in the note-cards we offered, but I would be curious how a bit of that \"one thing I struggled with/I thought could have been stronger\" piece could have been built into the feedback. ",
            "\u00a0See above ",
            "\u00a0Maria was an excellent section leader, who offered sensitive and careful responses to our work. She created an environment of care among our group and brought us together in her powerful prayer. Her candor and unapologetic inhabitance of herself made it easier for me to be truthful in my preaching. I deeply appreciate her leadership and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Julie was so encouraging all semester and really helped our section grow in confidence. She helped us to explore our preaching in a way that was critical and yet always kind. Her pastoral presence is a gift! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Streets' passion and gentleness made section an exciting and reassuring place. He offered deeply helpful comments with grace and concern for the well-being of preachers and congregation alike. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely phenomenal professor. She made our classroom feel like a family and a wonderful safe space. She always speaks from her heart. ",
            "\u00a0Dr.Long and Dr. Sharp worked as a cohesive team, with each often bringing a unique perspective to the lectures/discussions; including opportunities to present conflicting perspectives on specific topics (which is courageous). \r\n\r\nThe reading material was well selected and prepared us for a deeper understanding of each lecture/presentation.\r\nI looked forward to each reading, lecture, and section meeting. The feedback I received was critical and supportive. I feel this was one of the best courses I have participated in at YDS.  Thank you! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Long was a supportive, compassionate teacher who was gentle with us novice preachers and yet refused to let us be average. He insisted on incorporating critical feedback into the section, both from himself and from others, as we discussed sermons we had just preached. He has the dual heart of a pastor and a teacher, and I looked forward to section every week. ",
            "\u00a0See above. ",
            "\u00a0Her feedback was warm, constructive, and invaluable. Thank you for creating such a great space for our preaching section! ",
            "\u00a0He made the most insightful comments, and helped me become a better preacher by so much. I am very grateful to him. ",
            "\u00a0He is great, supportive and engaging. "
