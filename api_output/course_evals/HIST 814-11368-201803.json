            "\u00a0This course was exceptional. Professor Echeverri is a great discussion leader, and she incorporated all of our responses into the class material each session. I enjoyed the student presentations, each of which consistently added something to class discussions, and the short Tannenbaum paper, which pushed our analysis of class material in a new direction. Discussion was always lively, in part due to the diversity in expertise among the students. ",
            "\u00a0The reasons for the progression of readings throughout the course was not always clear, although it often was.  It included many interesting articles that allowed one to think about multiple facets of an issue/topic. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, yes --- this field is historiographically rich and constantly growing, and Professor Echeverri knows both the literature and the issues inside and out. Readings and discussions were intensely interesting, and the papers/presentations each added something to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but primarily for those with a grounding in the history of the Spanish Empire and/or Central and South America. "
