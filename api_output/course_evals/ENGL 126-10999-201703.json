            "\u00a0An appreciation of the evolution of English poetry post-Milton; a chance to do lots of close reading; a more complex understanding of and philosophy on memory. ",
            "\u00a0How to read poetry more slowly and thoughtfully. I also learned how to accept my own and other people's \"misreadings.\" ",
            "\u00a0Reading poetry takes dedication and an ability to analyze past what you know to something that may confuse you. Then taking that new piece of information and learning about it. ",
            "\u00a0There were a few more papers in one semester than I'm used to, but the assignments really helped me hone my writing skills, explicate poetry efficiently, and stay focused on the topics at hand. ",
            "\u00a0I am much better reader and writer after taking this course. Additionally, through this class I gained a deeper appreciation for English poetry and for the English craft more generally. ",
            "\u00a0English 126 encouraged me to pick up works that I wouldn't ordinarily choose to read and think about themes that connected them throughout their artistic periods. I also developed a different approach to writing about literature; Prof. Brisman encourages a problem-based, exploratory method rather than a thesis-focused approach. He also corrects rigorously for writing style, grammar, and support of ideas, so I feel that my writing improved in general by the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0After this class, poetry feels a lot more accessible to me, and I feel like I can definitely get more out of a poem. ",
            "\u00a0An engagement with literature and poetry concepts,  a foundational knowledge of key English poets, and improved writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This old version of Major English Poets II is phenomenal. I regret seeing its upcoming reformulation. The English Major as it has been structured, requiring students to take both 125 and 126, has provided me with invaluable foundational skills in close reading, thoughtful analysis, and academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills definitely improved, as did my knowledge of how to use the library effectively for research. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned so much more about the process of writing that I had ever truly given thought to. I developed the skill of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned  to analyze and appreciate different kinds of poems from different eras. In particular, I improved at reading poems with lots of annotations, allusions, and obscure language. The frequent essay assignments also helped me improve my writing skills. ",

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: A fabulous and well-paced syllabus. The Milton readings at the beginning were a bit much, but not nearly as heavy as they could have been considering how dense Paradise Lost can be. I don't like Pope, but he was a highly entertaining read. Wordsworth was a drag for me, but I grudgingly admit that he deserves his place in this class. Eliot and Glck were a pleasure. I'm going to read all the Glck poems we skipped in class over breakI love her that much. Thanks for introducing us.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The discussions are hit-or-miss. Sometimes full of wit and vigor, sometimes kind of dead. Pope produced a lot of kind of dead discussions, probably because open criticisms of his misogyny seemed to meet the professor's disapproval. I wish the discussions were more open to student debate. ",
            "\u00a0There were quite a few essays in this course which add up and can be overwhelming at times. Applying a theme to the essays also became difficult when thinking about what to write, but I felt my essay skills slowly improving over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the dichotomy of reading poets like Pope and Wordsworth and reading the more modern Louise Gluck. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions in the course were usually structured around one unifying idea that related to all of the readings, and this allowed the professor to structure the discussion while allowing room for student debate and interpretation. I found the course to be effective in the way it moves through time, especially the juxtaposition of Eliot and Gluck at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nI found that a weakness of the course was in the prompts of its assignments. We were instructed to write all essays of the semester on the theme of memory and received a few suggestions but overall little guidance in how to treat it for each work. I can see how some students might benefit from this kind of structure, but I would have preferred to look at the nuance of each work under a different lens that was suited specifically for that portion of the course (and receive a more structured assignment to do so). ",
            "\u00a0Please take out the Rape of the Lock from the syllabus!!! \r\nAlso  this depends largely on the people in the class but the classroom environment was somewhat stilted and ingenuine. It often felt like people were focused on how to make their comments using long words and complicated sentence structures rather than on the substance of their comments. It was hard to participate because of this environment. I also wish Professor Brisman had asked more open ended questions every so often.\r\nThe strengths of the class were the Eliot and Gluck readings, and just how open Professor Brisman was to meeting with students. Professor Brisman clearly cares a lot about both the material and his students. I also really liked that he didnt immediate give out letter grades on papers, and never did if you didnt ask for them. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized and taught in an engaging and educational manner. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be best with Milton left in it! If anything, cut Pope. ",
            "\u00a0This was the last iteration of the old 126 which allowed time to really dive into and explore Milton. Its well-structured and organized for learning ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are fascinating; in addition, the seminar style makes for wonderful discussions. Furthermore, I liked the flexibility we had when choosing themes for each essay. I would have appreciated, however, having a few suggested themes presented to us for each assignment. ",
            "\u00a0it is the classical english experience at yale. it is an enjoyable experience, for all lovers of poetry. "

        [
            "\u00a0It depends on the student, as it does with most courses. If you like analyzing poetry, you'll probably enjoy it whether or not you like the individual poets. If you're okay with writing five essays over the course of the semester, you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Don't give up a chance to take a course with Prof. Brisman. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot say whether or not to recommend this course as it will be changing after this semester, but I would definitely recommend it to students who want to take a class with Pr. Brisman. He is a very knowledgeable person about these readings, and if you take the time to meet with him and talk about them, you will not be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a phenomenal introduction to English poetry since Milton. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for someone who wants to develop a good feel for English poetry; especially when taken in conjunction with 125, it gave me a much stronger basis in being able to talk and write about poetry, and an appreciation for the connections and diversities of the work we studied through time. However, I may not recommend it highly for students who want a very student-focused class discussion. Professor Brisman tends to lecture for a good amount of class and has an idea of how he wants the discussion to go before class begins. I also would not recommend it for students who are concerned about grades; grades are only given when asked for, and the general impression is that it should be about the learning, not the grades. Therefore, it's very easy to put a lot of effort in to the class and not be satisfied with the final grade. I got a lot out of it taking it Credit/D. ",
            "\u00a0Trust your gut during shopping period! Professor Brismans teaching style is unusual and might work for some students better than others. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Brisman teaches the course and concepts in a truly influential manner. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended. Substantial coursework, all of which serves to fine-tune close reading skills. The small seminar format of this particular kind of course is invaluable for any English Major  really, for any student of the Humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Take it even if you dont think you get poetry. You get to read some great classic works of literature and your writing skills will definitely get better ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is one that is worth taking, and should be taken, during your time at yale! Even if you aren't planning on majoring in English, you should still take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. First of all, Professor Brisman is a wonderful professor. Second, the readings, though challenging, were fascinating and truly increased my love for the English language and all its capabilities. I especially liked the Wordsworth and Eliot sections. ",
            "\u00a0to those who want a classical experience, a good seminar-lecture balance and on the brink of exploring what it means to study traditional english men "
