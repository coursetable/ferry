I appreciated the secondary readings because it was interesting to see how modern scholarship from diverse fields may be brought to bear on Du Fu's work. Professor Bender helped us to think about the texts from angles or perspectives I otherwise may not have thought to do. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Even for students with no background knowledge in the language or poems or the poet, the class will allow them to engage and learn much. I found the course useful since it provides some other perspectives to read the poems ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. It is a great course for students interested in Chinese culture, but also for students of many interests such as literature, philosophy, history, and so on. I think anyone can get a lot out of this course. "
