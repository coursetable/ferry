Professor Schepartz is very engaging and enthusiastic.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Schepartz is very impressive but also slightly intimidating to approach and ask questions. We learned a lot of material in a very short amount of time, so keeping up with the material was difficult. Sapling was sometimes useful, but other times a lot of time spent on either really easy reactions or things we wouldn't need to know later for exams. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is that for much of the course, information is presented simply as memorization.  Not all material that you are expected to know is taught in class, and the exams are not at all reflective of the course material.  There are also five exams in total (including the final). ",

There are other classes besides yours! I know you think you're the center of the universe but you're not!\r\nAlso maybe get a less passive aggressive professor! She was SO rude any time anyone would ask a question or point out a mistake. \r\nAlso don't lie to us and say we don't need to know nomenclature or NMR or IR and PROCEED TO MAKE HALF THE PSET FREAKING NMR!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Reactions and mechanisms make sense in class and are pretty interesting, but having to memorize them all, including the reagents and so on, was a bit overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0Where to begin. This class is absolutely awful. It could not be more perfectly designed for students to bomb. Organic chemistry is all about doing practice problems and noticing trends. So what do we do? Receive 2 worksheets of problems the entire semester and other than that are left with Sapling to learn everything as if the level of difficulty on Sapling is within even a 100 times the level of difficulty of the exams. Professor Schepartz doesnt even cover all of the material on her tests in lecture, sometimes you have to learn material that is going to be tested on from practice tests two days before your exam. If youre taking this class, its because you have to and all I will say is good luck. If you have Professor Schepartz you are screwed. We went so fast through the material that apparently we went two chapters further than last years Orgo II class. Probably why the averages on the last two exams were a 65 and 61. For the fourth midterm exam not only did we have just one worksheet of practice problems, the practice exams she uploaded were mostly on material 4 whole chapters beyond what we learned. So going into the last exam we had about 5 example exam questions to base our studying off of. The result? A 61 class average on the exam. This class is terribly organized and is designed for you to fail. The exams are also egregiously too long for 50 minutes. In Orgo I, we got 1 hour to take exams that were considerably shorter than the exams in this class. Anyone who did well in this class is simply a natural at orgo who needed very little instruction to do well. You know the kinds of kids Im talking about, the ones who get a 99 on an exam with a 61 average (some kid actually did that). I got an A in Orgo I and Lord knows what Ill be getting in this class. If youre just a normal student who is grinding through it avoid Schepartzs class at all costs. If you have no choice, buckle up. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material, while difficult, was taught very nicely. I didn't think that Sapling questions were always very helpful and were sometimes irrelevant. I did think that section and the practice question sessions in class were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the content, the support available by the TAs and Peer tutors, the lectures\r\nIt could be improved by being taught a little slower (like after midterm 3). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's really cool chemistry! You learn an incredible amount of stuff in just a few weeks. Also, Schepartz is a good teacher in that she knows her material and how to explain it really well and is in a pretty good mood for 9:30 am. She also is always willing to answer questions and adjust the pace of the class to match what students need (e.g. just cut out two chapters at the end of the course because she wanted to go over some other material in greater detail). There also isn't much homework, just some Sapling every unit. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Schepartz goes super fast in lecture, which can be hard to follow. It's a lot of material to learn, and you end up having to memorize at least some of it, like the reactants and reaction conditions. There's also not a lot of review material beyond just doing practice problems from the book. ",
            "\u00a0The course pace was extremely fast, with a single cumulative midterm containing up to 30 new reactions. There could have been much more practice on retrosynthesis and homework questions tailoring to practicing that aspect. Sapling homework was not an effective way to practice concepts learned in class because it didn't teach you how exactly to think about certain reactions. Additionally, the course could be more organized in terms of presenting concepts. For instance, consolidating all reactions that involved creating a carboxylic acid, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course is easily the hardest thing I have ever done, which is why I dropped.  It is taught at such a fast pace that nearly everyone cannot hold on, and everyone always seems confused and lost. ",
            "\u00a0It was definitely really fast (even though I know Prof Schepartz slowed down). But I appreciated that she tailored the pace to our needs a little bit at the end. I also hated the Sapling--it often didn't line up with the material we learned in class, so I felt like I was wasting my time with a lot of the questions (I googled so many answers). And it was super specific about grading, and didn't always have the same criteria for resonance forms that we learned in class. It was pretty useless and frustrating (and we had to pay over $40 for it) ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of content to teach, which is always difficult in a large lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty well taught and organized but for most of the semester it felt like we were just going too quickly. It was hard to keep up with all of the information. Also, having four midterms and a final exam was very overwhelming. The last midterm was on the last day of classes and then we had another exam a week later. This class might be more manageable if there were just four non-cumulative midterms. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very difficult and it would be improved by teaching a smaller amount of material in a manner that makes it easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized, albeit I felt that practice exams could have been perhaps better tailored to the material actually covered on exams, as well as we would have appreciated if they were released earlier and not so close to the test dates. I also would argue that having 4 exams is unnecessary, as it felt that the final was just repetition on what was previously covered. Having just three exams allows for a focus on the final on the end of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Homework not great ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely rushed and not very organized. The amount of material covered in one semester was disproportionate and very overwhelming for the students. Having 4 exams and a final was extremely exhausting and overwhelming, as well. This was by far my most stressful course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the material. Organic chemistry is always elegant and beautiful and is a pleasure to learn about. However, I wish that we got to cover carbohydrates and amino acids. I think one weakness of this course is that it didn't really feel like organic chemistry of *life processes*. The organic chemistry that we learned was very isolated from biology, and I would have liked to see more connection with the life processes because there was almost no connection with life/biology. In addition, we did not get to cover carbohydrates and amino acids, which was sad, because I was really looking forward to it! Sometimes the expectations for each exam were not clear as in we never know what we need to know for each exam, and it just feels like we have to know everything. The exams were admittedly pretty straightforward and easy, but often times the questions and reagents are not consistent with what was taught in class. For example we learned that LDA gives the kinetic enolate and NaOH in protic solvent gives the thermodynamic enolate, but some reagent questions wanted LDA even though the product was formed through the thermodynamic enolate. Another example is that one test question gave protic and basic conditions for an aldol condensation, but the answer key wrote that it was supposed to be the condensed product, however we learned in class and through the textbook that in basic conditions you can stop at the aldol addition product whereas in acidic conditions it goes straight to the condensation product. In addition, it feels like you are flying through 30 reactions every day, but I personally think it's worth it. To reiterate, I think it would be really valuable to cover carbohydrates and amino acids. I feel like I'm missing out on some major organic chemistry knowledge, especially because these macromolecules are so applicable to life. One strength of this course was the extremely rapid turnaround time for feedback on exams. One weakness is that the FOURTH practice exams were not useful to practice at ALL. One of the exams only had two problems that were applicable to what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Schepartz is very nice, you get to drop a midterm\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course moves WAY too fast, there is not really any problem solving done before the actual exam (we don't have psets or textbook problems), and Sapling is completely terrible. It does not help you learn any of the content whatsoever (if anything it makes it even more confusing because they sometimes use different reagents/conditions) and tests information not covered in class/exams (nomenclature, NMR). Some of the problems are incrediblely confusing and you may find yourself doing the same 12 step problem 43 times just to find that your original answer was correct but you missed a single lone pair. Overall, it's extremely frustrating and an utter waste of time (and $44!!). I would strongly recommend eliminating Sapling altogether and just assigning textbook problems. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be helpful to have shorter Sapling assignments, but on a weekly basis to match material learned in class. This would be much more helpful with solidifying knowledge and keeping students on track. I also think having a Piazza for the class would be really helpful, as I'm sure many students had similar questions and would benefit from peer/TA/professor responses to questions. Having four midterms and a final was pretty rough  I would have preferred three midterms and and final that emphasized concepts learned in the last unit. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Orgo 2 is a lot of work, but ultimately very rewarding. I definitely feel like I have a much better understanding of chemistry after this semester. The actual workload of the class in terms of graded work is minimal, but it takes a lot of time to fully learn all the reactions, especially before exams. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was difficult to follow and practice tests were not always relevant to what we were learning. Sappling questions not all helpful and relevant but take a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0This class moves through material very quickly. The material on exams does not reflect the material covered in class. Questions were not encouraged in class, because they slow down the class and the professor worried that we would not get through all the material. It's evident that the professor does not truly care how much we learn about the material. Strengths? --None in particular ",
            "\u00a0way too fast. WAY too fast. you need to go slow and reemphasize CONCEPTS, not just reactions. ",
            "\u00a0First off, weaknesses: the sheer amount of reactions you have to memorize, understand, and reproduce; the lack of guidance for studying for finals and midterms (just practice exams, no Loudon problems assigned); the heavy reliance on Sapling Learning even though it does not provide good practice for exams.\r\nStrengths: the amount of time the peer tutors and teaching fellows put into review session and discussion sections\r\n\r\nOne that is both a weakness and a strength is that the class follows the textbook very closely, so during reading week, I just went through the textbook and studied the reactions from there, not even from my notes.\r\n\r\nOne weakness that I will not delve into here is how poorly run the STEM departments are at Yale: there is too much to say ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: overall pretty engaging, interesting to me but some found boring, grading is consistent, defintiely challenges you \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes got a bit dry with lots of reactions, 4 midterms and a final is a lot, very time consuming ",
            "\u00a0Frankly not too many strengths. The homework doesn't prepare you for exams, and some of it was completely unrelated to what we learned. The lectures went too fast, and it was hard to retain information. There wasn't too much real world application, so it just felt like drawing structures for the heck of it. The teaching was subpar, as well. ",
            "\u00a0While the course cover interesting and manageable content, it was mismanaged and made into an overwhelming and stress-inducing endeavor for students. We were not given adequate preparation for assessments, as practice exams often covered content that we were never taught. Weekly problem sets (not sapling, but written out) that give us exposure to the type of questions that will be on exams would be very helpful. Additionally, Sapling problem sets were not tailored to cover just the material we were expected to know (they included irrelevant content). ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the class was good, the material not too challenging, only there was a lot of it. There is more homework than in Orgo 1, but it helps you practice and learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness was how little emphasis was put on specific important reactions and mechanisms to know.  I wish we didn't focus on concepts especially when we were barely tested on any concepts. I wish there was a clear list of reactions and mechanisms needed to be known on Canvas that we could study off of, rather than have to guess which reactions to study from the textbook. We also strayed from the schedule posted which made it a bit diffucult to understand which portions of the textbook we were still responsible for. ",
            "\u00a0This class sucked. The tests were way too hard, the professor didn't know how to teach, and it made my semester miserable. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is brilliant, but teaches at a pace faster than most of the students could handle. Also, provided practice exams often contained non relevant material  for the fourth midterm, 2 were provided but the entirety of the second practice exam was irrelevant. The 4 midterm schedule is rough, but perhaps necessary due to the sheer volume of content. ",
            "\u00a0TAs are very inaccessible, the class was incredibly fast and hard to keep up with the material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-taught by amazing professor, good practice with Sapling homework sets (without a lot of pressure to get them right the first try); accessibility of office and peer tutor hours\r\nWeaknesses: very face paced (almost rushed) nature of course, especially with beginning half. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: this course is rigorous and doesn't mess around. There's a lot of material to learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Connections to life processes were not stressed. Lecture organization was hard to follow because she didn't reference which part of the textbook she was referring to. Tests were brutal and required you to memorize things like the exact pka of a type of hydrogen, which isn't useful and made studying even more difficult than it already was. ",
            "\u00a0So much info ",
            "\u00a0The professor does not have a good sense of the students' interests or reasons for taking the course. It is chaotically run and focused much more on memorization than understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches a lot of material very quickly, which is in some ways both a strength and a weakness. It is great to learn so much, but can be overwhelming and requires spending a massive amount of time outside of class to stay on top of the material, which can be extremely stressful when a student is taking other difficult classes. The exams were particularly stressful because they covered, in detail, material that was rushed through in class. Further, there was not much personal feedback, as the class is taught as such a large lecture and the only graded work are exams and online homework. The responsibility falls almost entirely on the student to constantly fill in the blanks from class using the textbook and online resources, and to figure out how to study. Finally, I found it very frustrating that new material was often rushed through in the class directly before an exam, and that the midterm practice exams often did not align with what we had actually learned, further making it difficult to study and know what to focus on.

However, it would've been helpful to have specific textbook problems recommended or assigned because many of the concepts we went over were difficult to understand without practice, and we weren't given that practice. Additionally, we were clearly expected to think a certain way about chemicals and reactions in this course, but lectures weren't framed this way and it was really hard to learn the deeper concepts and ideas when they were only mentioned once in passing and not written down. This made the course almost totally memorization, which it really shouldn't be if there's deeper understanding. Also, I understand that we have to get through certain material, but the course was really fast paced. Also, although the practice tests were helpful, it would be helpful to have more practice tests or practice tests that accurately reflect what's on the exam, since the practice tests weren't indicative of what we had been learning, and left us unprepared for the real tests. However, the discussion sections were helpful, and my TA (Aarushi Gupta) was incredibly helpful and without her I wouldn't have understood many of the complicated ideas in class.

While majority of the material was new, there was quite a lot that drew on things from 220, which I felt was a bit unfair because these things were not reviewed whatsoever but merely expected of us to remember. The four midterms in one semester also ramped up the workload quite a bit, but I guess having the last midterm so close to the final date helped me study for the final. ",

Professor Schepartz follows along with the book pretty well, and the Sapling is helpful with its practice problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sapling is sometimes repetitive and contains questions that are not helpful to the course, such as naming organic compounds. The book goes into more detail than is needed at times. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course moved very quickly, so it would have been nice to slow down or have more frequent review sessions to make the information easier to grapple with. Additionally, I would have loved to have problem sets more closely mirroring test questions rather than Sapling homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Change the professors. Make it a smaller lecture -- maybe have two sections of it? Or get rid of one of the lecture days in order to have an additional discussion section. It is an impossible amount of information and in order to go through it all the professors did not stop to take many questions or really explain what was going on. If they really can't cut back on the amount of reactions we need to go through, they need to incorporate more extra learning time, because it is impossible to understand what is going on the first time you see it, and discussion sections early in the week do not cover a whole week's material, only one lecture's worth. I would say over 50% of this material was never actually taught to me. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses was the Sapling homework that honestly was often a waste of time and asked for mechanisms that we did not even learn. I also did not think having practice exams and keys for them posted literally one or two days before midterms to be effective, especially because these are just old exams. It seems silly to make TF's write answer keys for these too--why isn't there already answer keys written since these were old exams? ",
            "\u00a0Generally, the lectures were clear and well-organized, and followed the order in the book fairly closely which made it easier to follow. Although exams were very difficult, the expectations were clearly delineated beforehand regarding what kinds of problems there were. The primary weakness was that the lectures were extremely fast-paced; we ended up not covering a lot of content at the end of the course. I wished that could have been decided ahead of time so we could have gone more slowly all along rather than only slowing down at the end. Often we were scrambling to take down the notes without having the time to understand the material during lecture. Also, it was often unclear for which reactions we were responsible for the entire mechanism vs the scheme vs aspects of the mechanism, etc - compared to Orgo I, it was much harder to predict what would be emphasized on exams. Also, discussion section was extremely disorganized / not worth attending and seemed highly variable based on what TA you had - having standardized practice problems or review topics would have been much more helpful than a generic Q and A format when often students hadn't yet studied enough to formulate questions.

Maybe if the professors took more time to teach a chapter rather than cramming us with too much information every week, we would do better on the exams. They're so focused on getting through a certain amount of chapters that they literally speed through everything. ",

            "\u00a0The class had the potential to be really great but it was taught so poorly. If the lecture notes had been more concise or more practice materials given out and gone over, maybe it would have been doable but as it was the class only brought stress, anxiety, and lots of crying.  There wasn't very much structure to the material. It was mostly just going to lecture three times a week to write down as quickly as possible what was put on the board and especially what was said, as much of what was said was not written down but definitely important to understanding the material. These notes were virtually useless, at least to me, as I could not find any way of helpfully organizing the material in my head despite trying different methods for each exam.The TAs could also be helpful to this extent as hopefully some of them also had similar struggles that they learned to overcome. It is not useful to have only experts teach students because experts do not remember what it was like to not understand the material. This is why I think Dr Martinez was not helpful in section. The sapling problem sets began as being very easy and maybe somewhat related but after the first 2 assignments the questions were tedious and definitely not representative of what we learned or what was on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was perfectly fine for the most part. The one thing I would suggest is a change in the sorts of problems assigned on Sapling. Problems which require us to draw mechanisms take an excruciatingly long time (10-15 minutes at least per mechanism that I could easily write by hand in 1 minute) because Sapling's platform is very slow. Sometimes my browser would crash as well. For reference, I am not using an old computer or anything. I would often have to skip completing these problems altogether simply because I had better ways to spend my time studying to do well in the course. However, the synthesis questions in sapling which gave starting materials/products and required us to draw/select reagents were very good and helpful. Since mechanisms come down mostly to memorization, I think it would be great if possible to have fewer mechanism problems on sapling and more synthesis problems. ",

Take the time to understand why things happen and what each reagent is used for, and you will have a much easier time. Highly recommend looking at a book named \"Chemistry as a Second Language\" and going through every single practice exam available. ",

I'm a humanities major, I struggle with orgo more than most do, and probably could have saved myself a lot of stress and disheartening grades by not taking the class at all. Unless you're the kind of person who is intellectually fulfilled by memorizing to a deep enough level that you can figure out just about any kind of question, I would avoid it if you can. For reference, the first midterm requires learning approximately as many reactions as the first semester of organic. If you do have to take it, do not take it in a 5.5 credit schedule; if orgo is challenging for you conceptually, it requires a few hours of studying after every lecture to feel comfortable with the material (a level I never quite achieved). Anecdotally, it seems that in the past it has been poorly taught but graded much more leniently, whereas this is the reverse experience. It isn't an unfair course at all, and my opinions are probably clouded by my frustration with the material -but do proceed with caution. ",
