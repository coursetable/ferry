            "\u00a0Strengths: the structure of the course is great (grammar topic followed by group reading), the instructor was great, and the workload was very reasonable (some reading before each class, a very small presentation at some point in the semester, and one final project and exam). Honestly no weaknesses. Easily my favorite class of the year. ",

            "\u00a0I'm fairly certain this is the instructor's last year teaching it, so while I loved this class, a class is only as good as the person who teaches it. I think it's a great class to take if you want to improve your Arabic reading without needing a 1.5 credit class that meets every day. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If youre interested in developing your Arabic grammar skills and or just want to read Arabic Islamic texts. "
