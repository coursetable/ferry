            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the diversity of primates and many of the cool things about their lives. I also gained deeper understanding of evolution and scientific thinking. ",
            "\u00a0We learnt how to understand ignorance. In other words, we learnt how to know what we don't know. We also learnt how analyze graphs, ask correct questions, skim scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interpret but also analyze the shortcomings of various graphs. I also learned the significance of making a hypothesis when doing experiments. The glory of the course was being able to compare non-human primates to humans and being able to apply our knowledge at the Bronx zoo. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about primate behavior and ecology, and also how to learn about the behavior of complex social mammals. I also learned how to conduct brief and calming mindfulness practices which is an excellent skill I greatly value and have been using before all of my stressful experiences! ",
            "\u00a0I gained much more self confidence in science related fields through our study of research methods and scientific papers on primatology. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not only about learning the content on the field of primatology but an investigation into fundamental concepts such as the definitions of theory, skepticism and hypothesis. I learned to question the literature when appropriate and to direct class focus to areas and questions that I was interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use an ethogram. ",

            "\u00a0Learned the basics about non-human primate identification and behavior, and was given the opportunities to draw conclusions about what their existence means for human society. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general understanding of primate taxonomy (first half of the course largely spent on primate groups and evolution) and a sense for concepts surrounding the application of the socioecological model and the complexity of natural selection to primates (second half). ",

            "\u00a0The lecture is structured very much as a conversation and I really enjoyed that. At times that meant we didn't cover all of the material for a session, but the professor was awesome about adapting the course expectations according to what was covered. I really appreciated the presence of the teaching fellows. The Zoo trip was a highlight. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: trip to the Bronx zoo, interacting with skulls of primates, watching videos of primates in action\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: teaching style (a little bit unorganized), students expected to answer their own questions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Visiting a zoo and seeing primates in action, handling the skulls of primates, analyzing videos of primates. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Teaching style is too unorganized and too many tangents, students expected to answer their own questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really interesting and presents fun material in a variety of ways. I think that perhaps it could be a bit more organized, but overall it was excellent and I do not have complaints. Eduardo is fun and engaged, and though we can sometimes stray off topic, I really liked the conversations that we had along the way. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of the assessment is very subjective- makes it difficult to know how you are doing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great basis for primatology as a study. Professor and teaching fellows are up to date on the field research and concepts of the course. \r\nWeakness: Objectives for the midterms could have been posted slightly sooner. ",
            "\u00a0This course would benefit from better TAs. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths, the class is fun, the professor is passionate.\r\nweakness, the class is disorganized, too much irrelevant content. ",
            "\u00a0The material is really interesting and the zoo trip was SO FUN, but the lectures are quite dense. Sometimes it feels like Eduardo is trying to teach the entire field of primatology AND and introductory Ecology and Evolutionary Bio class AND a theory of science class all at once. This makes studying for the tests extremely time-intensive and exhausting because there's so much you \"need to know.\" Also, for a class that is taught by a professor who theoretically puts a lot of value on participation and asking questions, your performance on the tests is 60% of the grade, which seems like a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths are the focus on students, the use of interesting fieldwork writings, and the compelling topics. Some weaknesses just had to do with technical logistics that could be resolved with some more firm demarcation of what will happen in class or what is expected of students. ",
            "\u00a0The course seems to be a very comprehensive survey of primate studies, so its subject matter would be a strength. Also, lectures were relatively engaging and section was helpful. However, the course staff could work on being clearer about the organization of the course material and about the expectations for homework and exams. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with scientific concepts by diving into the interesting world of nonhuman primates. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to people who enjoy learning about things that are not in their typical academic sphere and who want to challenge themselves to learn more about a niche subject. Overall, it is not a curved course and definitely not an easy A as the cut off is at a 95%. This course is designed for non-majors but he will make it very obvious if you are not a non-major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a breath of fresh air as a course. ",

            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. There are very few classes, especially lectures, offered at Yale that have a professor and teaching fellows who are so committed to student learning and making sure that everyone is on the same page whether you are a STEM major or in the humanities. I have already recommended this course to plenty of friends and would highly recommend anyone even remotely interested to check out this class during shopping period. I took this class because I was genuinely interested in the subject but there were so many people who took it for different reasons, so it was also enjoyable having students from very different backgrounds studying the same thing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I believe that Professor Fernandez-Duque is a fantastic lecturer with an incandescent intellect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great science class for non-STEM people. I wouldn't say it's a gut, but you can do well if you put in effort. You also learn a lot. Great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Because of the way lectures are structured (with high levels of engagement), you will definitely retain information from this course long past the exams end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I'd tell them there shouldn't expect to keep up with all the material. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. Maybe if you have already taken a few Evolutionary Bio classes and don't need to be learning a lot of theory on top of primate facts. The tests are fair based on the study guides, but the study guides are really long and require several days of work to complete. However, if you are really interested in learning more facts about non-human primates, this is probably a good course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you find observing primates interesting and need a science credit that isn't math-focused. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student with a specific and particular interest in primates and their evolution because it very effectively covers that subject. I would not recommend this course to a student interested in how that topic relates to humans because that is not covered. "
