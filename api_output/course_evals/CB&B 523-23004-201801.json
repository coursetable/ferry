            "\u00a0I learned a great deal behind the mathematics, physics, and modeling of molecular mechanisms from this course. The topics were very interesting and ranges from actin polymerization to gene expression. ",
            "\u00a0I will take away knowledge of modeling biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0how to do simulation ",
            "\u00a0I had the chance to apply my physics knowledge to a new field. This course also served as a good tool for learning about biology beyond high school curriculum from a statistics based viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0This course really forced me to think about the physical basis for topics that I have covered in depth in other classes. It also greatly improved my confidence in modeling phenomenon and thinking mathematically/statistically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that between many biological processes and systems there is common physics that describes these phenomena. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths, Simon is a great instructor and connects material well. Weaknesses is that while the work is more thorough and the discussion sections are designed for people to get help I think it would be more useful as supplementary instruction time where TA's go through problems related to the homework or recover what was covered in class in a scheduled manner because no one really asks questions and because a huge amount is covered in lecture I think that would help students reinforce it without giving as huge of homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe class was very informative and lectures were mostly clear. The use of powerpoints and images/diagrams was very important in the course. \r\nThe homeworks were challenging but reinforced the material well. \r\nThe class also focused on some coding which is always a fundamentally good concept to learn (Mathematica and MATLAB)\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThere was a big workload. ",
            "\u00a0The homework sets were very helpful, but some problems were repetitive and unnecessarily long. ",
            "\u00a0very systematic ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job of emphasizing the important material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught in a way that was very clear to folllow. All concepts built upon each other and were clearly explained. The homework was a bit much, but it definitely did help to enforce the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were very long and challenging, but were good learning exercises. I liked the study hall sessions, where either the professor or the TA was present to answer questions. Group work and collaboration on problem sets were key for this class. Friday-midnight deadlines for assignments was not pleasant for the students. Having a weekend to do the problem sets is also important for balancing this class in addition to other classes, since the assignments took so long. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to students who do not plan to take any other courses with a large workload. While the homework wasn't conceptually challenging, the sheer amount of homework problems makes the class a serious time investment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class was great! It was challenging, but I learned a lot. I was able to learn physical aspects of biology, which was fascinating. The professor made this class special. "
