            "\u00a0I really liked this course. I am not in EMD, so it was nice to be given an in-depth look at HIV, Malaria, and TB. I learned so much. However, I think that sometimes it was assumed that the class had more of a background in these topics areas than they did (maybe they did, but I didn't). So sometimes it was hard to keep up. I also wish there were more direct comparisons to the United States - not only am I not super well-versed in EMD, but I also didn't know a bunch about global health, though this class taught me a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting subject matter, engaging lectures, learn about the history/biology/symptoms of the disease\r\nWeakness: Course work primarily back-loaded (fourth homework, third quiz, group presentation, and final paper all due within a few weeks of each other) ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class! Would highly recommend to any non-EMD students who want to learn more about infectious diseases. I would actually suggest removing the PID pre-requisite, because I was allowed into the class without it and have still managed to do well, and I think it's presence may deter students from other departments from taking the class. Besides that, I loved the way information was conveyed and how we were assessed in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Class was fair.  Homework assignments were similar to those in PID 1 and PID 2, so if you were comfortable with those, this class is not much different.  I had background in these diseases from courses in undergrad and was bored at times.  I did not get as much new information as I expected, but the class was good overall.  Sunil stated the quizzes were just a general knowledge check, calling them the \"basic ingredients\" to the diseases, but many peers agreed that many questions were incredibly specific and ambiguous.  They are not worth very much of your grade, about 5% each, but many questions were much more detailed than advertised. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course! Sunil does a great job at covering the Big 3 from so many different perspectives. The readings are really interesting and I felt as though I was learning through the homeworks. In terms of the workload, the course is HEAVILY backloaded. It would be much more manageable if a midterm paper was assigned and the final was just the final presentation. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a great overview of more technical aspects of the Big 3 diseases (e.g. specific treatments, prevention methods, molecular epidemiology, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I mainly took this course to dive deeper into tuberculosis. There was more malaria than TB or HIV, but that is to be expected given the instructor's background. Regardless, I thought this was a great course to learn any of the big 3. I really enjoyed the format in which each disease was presented: introduction, treatment, and prevention. It dove into the science well, the pharmacology associated with treatments, and some innovative prevention methods. The guest speakers were a great touch, as you could see issues from multiple perspectives. The quizzes and homework assignments were challenging - just how they should be. ",
            "\u00a0Very informative and fun to learn. Focused topics made me learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal class that did a really nice job of weaving together the epidemiology, social and political context and biology of the Big 3 diseases. It also offered a really nice mix of academic vs. practical considerations, which I really appreciated. Lectures were well organized and delivered, and I actually found the homeworks and quizzes to be well-designed for learning. In fact, I would actually recommend weighting the quizzes a bit more heavily; studying was a good excuse to review the material and it would be nice to have added incentive to spend time on it.\r\n\r\nI actually liked this class so much that I would encourage more people to take it, and would recommend eliminating the pre-requisite in order to help make that happen. I had not taken PID before, and was admittedly out of the loop on some of the topics discussed, but really appreciated the opportunity to learn more about those topics. If there were enough interest, I think that it could be helpful to have a structured TA review session (with a set curriculum) in order to review ID concepts that often get rushed through in class since most people have that prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed hearing from our guest speakers, though found it a bit frustrating that they repeated quite a bit of material that had been covered in other lectures, especially because we already had limited time for HIV and TB. In the future, I wonder if these guest lectures can be consolidated into a single panel discussion? I think that Professor Parikh could help guide the conversation to offer novel topics not covered as thoroughly in other lectures, such as what it was like to be a researcher in the early days of the HIV epidemic, the relationship between academics and activism, career advice, the most recent research trends, etc.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'd appreciate just a bit more interaction in class. I really enjoyed the malaria exercise we did to compare different transmission reduction strategies, and think it could be replicated for other topics. One idea would be to have a bit more of a discussion about the Snowden book, or a little more debate about ethical issues related to the three diseases. ",
            "\u00a0Its a fantastic course.  Sunil Parikh is an expert in the field who creates useful PowerPoint slides and adequately communicates the most important big picture details of the three most significant infectious disease threats, while also balancing this with a surprisingly detailed exploration of disease pathology and treatment. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-arranged. I think one of its main strengths is having Sunil as the main instructor, because he is very knowledgable of all three diseases and does a great job to tie issues in each of the three together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good overview of all three diseases; definitely covers the essentials that you should know about each disease. As an EMD student, I definitely felt that I should know more about all three diseases, and this class helped me accomplish that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes were meant to \"cover the essential information\", but often times, I felt it was asking for details that are not \"essential to know\". Quiz questions were frequently tossed out, so need to be sure questions can't be misinterpreted. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course.  The only suggestion I have is that we might distribute the time spent on each disease equally; it was malaria-heavy, and I might have enjoyed more time spent on tuberculosis. ",
            "\u00a0This class was excellent. A great understanding of the three big infectious diseases faced around the world. The class was organized and well-taught. I learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided substantial amounts of information of multiple facets of each disease that was studied during the semester. This course was very heavy on memorization for the quizzes on each disease throughout this semester, which is not common for someone that is not an EMD student, but allowed me to delve into a different mode of knowledge acquisition than others I have employed thus far at YSPH. I surprisingly enjoyed this departure from my norm. The homework assignments were very in-depth, which made them difficult to complete but were very thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting course. Learned a lot about the biology of the pathogens, treatment and vaccines while still brought in important public health concepts regarding prevention and social determinants that effect transmission. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:\r\n-subject matter was engaging and the instructor was clear when teaching\r\n-in class group work was helpful for learning \r\n-personally preferred the smaller class size for one of the lectures because it was easier to engage the class and the instructor in discussion\r\n-homework assignments covered important topics discussed in class but at greater depths-- questions did not feel cherry-picked or random\r\n-instructor and TA were available to answer questions and provide clarity\r\n-assignments and projects did not completely feel like busy work and were useful \r\nweaknesses/ improvements: \r\n-timing was an issue- the class tended to go over the designated class time, which I felt was unfair for people who had class or work afterwards and would be missing part of the lecture; 10 or 15 minutes over class time isn't too bad, but more than that would be too much\r\n-the quizzes were difficult- I thought the purpose of the quizzes was to overview the main parts of each of the three diseases but the quizzes seemed more detail-oriented than expected "

            "\u00a0Sunil is a great teacher! He is super smart and it was nice to hear his initiatives and the other programs and projects that are actually going on to combat these diseases. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed taking this class, and this is in large part because of Sunil.  His lectures are engaging and fascinating, and when applicable, he told us about his experiences with these diseases.  I also appreciated the guest lecturers he invited, as we could hear from world-renowned experts' first-hand experiences in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor- Sunil did an excellent job at explaining all of the content in a way that was both interesting and informative. My only recommendation would be to pay more attention to the background of the class, as  this year a good handful of us were from non-EMD backgrounds (as a I mentioned above) and sometimes fell behind when things were not explained because it was assumed that we had seen this in other EMD courses. I am definitely not asking that he change the course to make it totally intro-level, but I think it would be helpful for everyone in the class if the professor took the 30 seconds to remind everyone what certain concepts/vocab words were and what they meant. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though Sunil truly did not respect my time.  Nearly every week, class ran over time.  I understand that Sunil wanted to present as much information as possible and his lectures were interesting, but some of us had class directly after that we would be late to.  One week, a guest speaker even double checked that he could speak until 12 (which he went over) and Sunil said that was correct even though class ends at 11:50 and the next round of classes start at 12.  Once in awhile is ok, but this was nearly every single week to the point that I questioned whether or not Sunil knew what time class was supposed to end.  He did give us a short break in the middle of class, but this does not make up for going over time as some of us needed to get to other classes or commitments.  The time slot for the final exam also went 45 minutes longer than the two hours allotted.  I did not want to disrespect my peers by leaving before they presented, but this is a busy time of year.  I felt this was inappropriate and felt disrespected throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Sunil is awesome! It is great that he can address the big 3 from a clinical and public health perspective. His lectures are comprehensive but simple to follow and really interesting. Wish he could teach more of my classes. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Parikh is incredibly down to earth, and I really enjoyed his teaching. He has a sense of humor to keep things interesting, and he's so knowledgeable about the field (especially malaria). Often times, we did not complete the full set of lecture notes. Ultimately, I'm okay with that because Dr. Parikh presented the material in a very detailed and organized manner otherwise. A good instructor goes a long way in making a course worthwhile, and Dr. Parikh is one of my favorite instructors I have come across in my time here. ",
            "\u00a0Very knowledgeable and approachable. Enjoyed class exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Parikh is wonderful. His global experience as a clinician and researcher really helped bring to life the issues discussed in class, and his passion for patient care really comes through. He is a very methodical lecturer, and did a truly fantastic job putting together the syllabus... readings were comprehensive but not repetitive, it included pivotal papers in the field, and felt very up-to-date.\r\n\r\nThe only recommendation I have is to build in time for questions or discussion. There were a few times where I or other classmates had questions, but our hands went unnoticed, and it wasn't clear if we were rushing to finish material or if you just didn't see. ",
            "\u00a0Truly one of the greats at Yale.  Mild mannered in an endearing way.  Has a command of the material and conveys it well through a combination of well chosen readings and excellent presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Sunil is an excellent instructor. He probes students to think critically and is very receptive and positive when receiving a student question, always making the student feel heard and like their point was thoroughly considered. He is not too caught up in making the course meet certain administrative requirements grade-wise, but emphasizes learning and critical engagement as the primary objectives. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Parikh was a fantastic instructor.  His interest and passion for these diseases and their impact is obvious, and I really enjoyed learning from him.  He responded well to questions, and kept the course steered towards the most important epidemiological concepts of the three diseases. ",
            "\u00a0Sunil is a great instructor. He explains material well and is very helpful. It was a pleasure to be in his class ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable on the topics discussed and used this knowledge and experience to expand on the baseline information provided for each disease. This made the course and relevant information more engaging. I appreciated the inclusion and description of all aspects of each disease as well as the extra included lecture this semester on the biological causes and plausibility of disease, its treatment, and its public health patterns and implications. ",
            "\u00a0Sunil was great. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was great. His lectures were engaging and I really enjoyed not only covering the concepts, but also the little facts and anecdotes he provided. I was excited for class and class activities. This class is long, so the small break in the middle was very much appreciated. Sunil was also responsive to questions and clarifications. While he was certainly busy, he still made time to meet with students and make up lectures when necessary. Great instructor overall! "

Although it is very in-depth, it's not just for EMD people and can be useful in understanding epidemics and prevention/diagnosis/treatment barriers in general, as well as what different strategies various places are doing to combat different epidemics. ",

Take this if you want to learn about the science of these 3 diseases more. The fantastic instructor is a plus. ",

It provides a great overview of three of the biggest public health threats of our time, and the material is presented in a digestible and interesting way. Hands-down one of my favorite classes at YSPH! ",

Even if a student's focus is not specific for these three diseases, it is essential for any infectious disease epidemiologist to have a knowledge base for them.  Aspects of the biology and epidemiology of the Big 3 can be applied to many other pathogens, and they are presented in such a clear and engaging manner that you retain a lot of the course's key ideas.

The final assignments did require a lot of time and attention to complete, but I enjoyed learning more about the different organizations and programs associated with malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS, and how all these organizations may be related and interact with each other. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, for the course content and for Sunil's lectures. The class does require a chunk of time to complete assignments and understand the concepts, but the work wasn't any different than other courses and was reminiscent of Principles of Infectious Diseases (1 and 2). This was one of my favorite courses. "
