The field trips offered were really cool, too. \r\nWeaknesses: The reading summary presentations were a bit monotonous after the first 3-4 people presented. \r\nAreas of improvement: Perhaps, have students do group presentations so there are less overall presentations by students over the course of the semester. Penalize students for not adhering to blog post schedule. There was a glut of posts at the end of the semester so I didn't have a chance to read most of them. ",

            "\u00a0Instructor and TA were both terrific, content and structure of the course outstanding. Nice mix of quizzes, exams, paper, blog and presentation requirements and great to have two field trips. Lectures were interactive with discussion. All really good.\r\n\r\nNo suggestions for improvement. I almost wish it could have gone on longer! "

            "\u00a0Keep up with the readings, don't get behind. Ask questions if you don't understand something because the instructor wants you to understand. Dig into the science as better understanding the fundamentals of the science helps with the higher level understanding of the importance of the various topics. "
