            "\u00a0Basic survey of neuroscience. It was a typical class in terms the lecture format. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the topics of vision, electrophysiology, nociception, motor learning, memory, and other important topics in neuroscience. Majority of the information was new to me so I gained a lot of insight. "

            "\u00a0A level of disorganization in the order in which the class is taught\r\nSometimes review material provided did not align with topics covered in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was a basic survey of neuroscience, which was helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was not tailored to the graduate students at all. I didn't find the seminar to be beneficial. The level of engagement from the other graduate students was reduced by the structure of the class, and the instructor input/questions filled most of the class time. It felt like the purpose of the presentation was to push the presenter to answer questions from the instructors rather than improving the understanding of other students in the course. \r\n\r\nIt could be improved by going in more depth rather than breadth. The seminar section could be reorganized to be led by students to be more of a discussion about the other student's work rather than a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very challenging. For each test, I studied two weeks in advance. I created study guides, flashcards, practice problems, read the book, studied in groups, and asked the instructors for help. Yet I still was not performing as well as I liked on the test. The way the course is designed is not intended for first year graduate students who were not Neuroscience undergraduates. I was learning a lot of the information for the first time so the class was very demanding. "
