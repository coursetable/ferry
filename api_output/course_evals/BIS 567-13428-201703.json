The instructor is engaging and extremely willing to be available for questions outside of class time, which was unique and definitely a highlight of this class.  The topic of the course is fascinating and useful, and the variety of final projects illustrated this and were very interesting.  The only suggestion I might have is that there were many interesting applications introduced in lecture that were not necessary covered on the problem sets - in order to have a better grasp of those applications, it might have been interesting to have some optional problems to think about of the problem sets (perhaps extra credit?).

Definitely difficult, be weary if you don't have a strong math background. "
