            "\u00a0I have learned many interesting computer architectures which I have never heard before. Deep learning and some architectures for Deep Learning Neural Network acceleration are also covered. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course. For example, topic 1 impressed and shocked me a lot, which gave me a chance to read Von Neumanns unfinished book Computers and the Brain and 1946 reports. The book Computers and the Brain drew picture of a live Neumann, the 1946 reports declared the beginning of modern computer science. I did not read these materials before, I think reading these works made me understand deeper on computers.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lethin also introduced the current progress in computer architecture for AI, including thinking machines, cognitive computing, neural networks... There are assignments for each topic, which made me understand these architectures deep. "

            "\u00a0Everything is very good. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure and format of this course is perfect. During this semester, Professor Lethin and we have discussed new topics every class, and we have read many papers to understand computer architectures in the history and recent progresses in computer architectures for AI. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to say which topic is the least interesting one, because I learned new knowledge in every topic. However, I think Assignment 4 (thinking about ideas for final projects) could be improved. Instead of uploading and evaluating several ideas, we could spend one class to discuss ideas together. In this way, ideas which were not good or practical may be corrected in time, and new ideas may be put forward. "

            "\u00a0This course is a very good course. I will recommend this course to any students who are interested in artificial intelligence or would like to know more about non-conventional computer architectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed this course very much. I think it is one of the best courses I have ever taken before, and of course, it is the one with most abundant materials and papers to read, students will learn every aspect of computer architecture for AI.
