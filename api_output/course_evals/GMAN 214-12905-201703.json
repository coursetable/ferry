            "\u00a0In this course, I absolutely learned new skills about how to understand language. Reading developed an entirely new meaning and I found new ways to decipher language and even see how it could be manipulated. Professor Connolly did an excellent job in showing us how the appearance of language itself on a page creates meaning, and explaining how meaning has many more traditional ways of being created outside the content of words. This newly critical eye is certainly a skill I am walking away with after having taken this course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a completely new understanding of how to read/analyze poetry, and an appreciation for untraditional poetic techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first poetry class I took, and I developed an entirely new skillset for close reading and interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a survey of great poets who write for the most part in French (two write in German). They are varied in style, form, and subject matter, with varying levels of \"madness\" about each. Some are very \"acquired tastes,\" but they are worth reading, as French poetry, especially from this period, was very influential on the works on literature and art that followed it. As a French major, I feel my education would have been incomplete without this course, and because I took it for credit toward the major, all of my reading and writing for the course was done in French (though the lectures were conducted in English), which was good practice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at poems differently, with an analytical eye. I learned to think about every detail of the language and it's hidden meanings and connotations. My French improved, and I feel more confident in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read poetry, how to contextualize poets in broader historical times, how to write essays about poetry, and how to go outside my comfort zone in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of French literary movements were developed by taking this course. Additionally, I learned how to analyze poetry at a deep level and write papers that incorporated secondary sources with the poetry commentary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply to historical and personal context behind a poem into my reading of it. I also learned how to read poetry itself and interpret writing less literally. "

            "\u00a0A strength is certainly Professor Connolly. He approached each lecture exceptionally well-prepared and well-organized. At the beginning, the length of the readings also constituted a strength; Professor Connolly made quite clear one of his loves for poetry stemmed from its capacity to be read in full in one sitting. As a result, readings at the beginning of the course felt manageable; I could come to each lecture having completed each reading in full. Yet, towards the middle/end of the semester, the assignments became increasingly long/broad; we'd be tasked with reading an entire book of poems for instance, without any guidance on where the lecture's focus would be. As a result, I found it harder to engage on the same deep level with those works; simply completing them proved a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses are few and far between. I think that the course was a seminar presented as a lecture-- Professor Connolly was always willing to take questions or stop the lecture to open up discussion, and I wish the whole course had been run this way. However, we then might have missed out on some of the Professor's fascinating lecture content so I'm not totally sold on that idea. The set up of the class did encourage people to simply take notes, and not engage directly with what the Professor was saying. This works for some, but not for me. The strengths were the content of the lectures-- every day we heard an eloquent and prepared analysis of the life of a new poet. Professor Connolly seems to have no limit to the depth of his knowledge. My favorite moments of the course were when the professor would look at a particular poem and indicate certain nuances in the original language or bits that related to the poet's life that would indicate just how intentional every decision made by the poet was. I remember vividly the professor remarking on the Deux Ailes of a Mallarme poem in relation to the deux \"l\"s of his own name. This type of subtlety always blew my mind and made me sit up in my seat. ",
            "\u00a0Because I took this class for credit toward the French major, I would have loved for it to be entirely in French, and had it been offered as an L5 course, I think there would have been more interest in the French component, because there is a shortage of L5 French courses offered this year. I think the course also could have been a seminar, since the lectures were based in biographical information, which is, though insightful, not essential to understanding and analyzing the texts themselves. I know this would make it resemble the the La posie en prose course that was to be offered this spring, but since it's no longer being offered, I think this would be helpful. \r\n\r\nOne strength is that during the lectures Professor Connolly often asked students to comment or participate, which kept it more dynamic than sitting there for an hour. The fact that it is offered in two languages also helps expose to the subject matter people who might not have otherwise been able to, and those with some background in French can choose how much they'd like to engage with the original. ",
            "\u00a0The class was an interesting combination of lecture and seminar, which I enjoyed. Although Professor Connolly spent a lot of time speaking, he opened to the floor to discussion and questions. I think this was an effective way to split the time. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introduction to some of the weirdest and most famous French poetry of the last two centuries. Connolly is a fantastic guide through this world: his lectures are entertaining and well-structured, and he makes a point to include everyone in discussion. Sections in French and English; lectures in English. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course that gave a very insightful, well-balanced, and interesting introduction to mad poetry in the 20th century. I think it would have benefitted from being an all-French course. There really aren't enough advanced (post-198) courses with the FREN designation that are actually taught completely in French. This means that non-major, advanced French students only practice their on-the-spot expression once a week for 50 minutes. Regardless, Professor Connolly was a wonderful professor and I really enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great syllabus, good assortment of poets, interesting assignments, good chances to get feedback on writing, a fun atmosphere in class (Professor COnnolly is very enthusiastic and leads good discussions), and a reasonable amount of readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No real weaknesses, this course was what I expected it to be, I like the way that Professor Connolly laid it out. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Having a lecture style course during the week and then having a separate discussion section for close readings helped my understanding of the text. ",
            "\u00a0I found the lectures somewhat unengaging because they were so abstract at times. However, it is clear the Professor Connolly is very passionate about the subject and it was pleasant to learn from him. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student seeking to deepen their critical thinking skills. I, myself, came into the course hesitant; I had never taken a poetry course at Yale and, for no real reason, and decided \"I didn't like poetry\" as a whole. Professor Connolly entirely inverted this notion for me. I feel I am walking away with a wholly new appreciation for poetry and new tools to find meaning in not just poetic works, but in any reading I engage with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Especially for students who don't take many courses in literature, this course was a wonderful place for me to build a foundation for examining literature critically. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course. As an econ major, literature classes can be intimidating, especially because of the reading load. Poetry is perfect, because the readings are more manageable to complete. Professor Connolly is energetic, and one of the best professors I have had at yale. His lectures are thorough and engaging, drawing from different fields and forms outside of poetry criticism and scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend it. The poetry is worth reading, even though you will probably not like all of it. These works have been deeply influential and the range present in them illustrates the richness of the latter epochs of the French poetic tradition. \r\n\r\nThe lectures are in English, and you can choose whether to do section in English or French. For credit toward the French major or Literature major with credit in French, you need to do all the readings and write your essays in French. This may be scary at first, but with the first two essays (3-4 pages and 5-6 pages, respectively), you have the opportunity to revise based on the extensive notes and feedback Professor Connolly gives on your first attempt. The first grade doesn't count, but you should put in effort so that you can get helpful feedback and revise accordingly. \r\n\r\nThis course is good practice in reading and writing, but the fifty minutes of section a week aren't very helpful in maintaining an L5 level of speaking.\r\n\r\nDefinitely seek Professor Connolly out in office hours to discuss the readings or your papers. He will be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The poems are great, and they are not too long. There are not too many assignments, and they are all relatively enjoyable. I learned a lot and greatly enjoyed every class. ",
            "\u00a0Good class for looking into french and some german poetry. Class is lecture about the poets and sometimes workshop/working through analyzing poems, section is discussion. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who has never taken a poetry course before, I took Mad Poets to go out of my comfort zone and to immerse myself in something different. Mad Poets did just that, I read fun texts that were different than anything I had ever read before, I got to write papers that were very different and interesting, and got to learn about fascinating poets from a Professor who was passionate about them. Mad Poets is the type of course that you come to Yale to have the opportunity to take, especially if you usually take courses in a completely different field. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, and in fact, I took this class upon recommendation from a friend who took the class a year before. It was a great class to develop an understanding and because poetry tends to be short, the readings were not overwhelming throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has a budding interest in poetry and is keen to pursue it. "
