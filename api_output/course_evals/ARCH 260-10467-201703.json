            "\u00a0It was a really fun lecture that followed the history of architecture chronologically. I learned to read buildings in much detailed manner. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to look at and analyze architecture from a historical perspective, and I learned about a variety of specific examples of great architecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered major architectural creations between the Egyptian pyramids and the Versailles baroque. I learned a lot about how to analyze architecture, how the context can shape architecture, and how it is often a response to what has been done before in other places. I think being able to analyze architecture has been the most important skill I've developed from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I got a sense for the key buildings and architectural movements between antiquity and the baroque period in Western Europe and learned about how to discuss and critique architecture. ",
            "\u00a0While the course certainly did offer a sense of the development and interaction of architectural languages across history, more critically it trained students to read buildings for their typological and morphological significance. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Each lecture is based on a single building and sometimes we make big assumptions about a period based off of a single building, it can be improved on the diversity side. Sometimes we didn't really know what dates we were talking about, so having a timeline on slides might help. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the format of looking at one building per lecture rather than doing a more traditional-style survey. ",
            "\u00a0This course is meant to be a comprehensive survey of architecture to the Baroque. What it does achieve in breadth comes not merely at the expense of depth, but also in terms of how we engage with architecture outside the Western canon. Repeated yearly calls have been made to reform not just the content but HOW we think about these cultures - phrases like riches of the East really detract from a far more nuanced understanding of other architectures.\r\n\r\nTo improve, I would suggest that the professor incorporate non-Western literary sources (eg we read a French traveller for the Taj Mahal), not merely as additional reading but to inform a larger interpretation of said architectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course I think is the actual content. I think the buildings chosen to be taught were all really interesting and significant (at least from what the lectures argued) and the way their context played a role in the buildings' development was very interesting. I think the weakness of this course was that each lecture was not taught in a very easy to follow manner, and so it felt difficult to retain the information being given to us. I feel like if each individual lectures were structured in a more logical, sequential way, I would have been able to remember more things about each building and its historical setting. ",
            "\u00a0The class' strength is its ability in exposing students to important buildings and architects of the Italian Renaissance. Its weakness is its limited scope. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good and seemed thoughtfully put together; the buildings selected were interesting and I felt like the history was very continuous. However, it was an extremely narrow selection of architecture history, especially for a course that is the only required class in that discipline for architecture majors. I was disappointed to find that the course only covered architecture surrounding the mediterranean (with the exception of the Taj Mahal) and wished that it would cover a more global variety of buildings, which would seem more appropriate for the architects of today. ",
            "\u00a0The most glaring weakness was the course's glaring bias towards western architecture designed predominantly by italian men. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Take it, workload is manageable and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It is a really interesting topic and it is well taught, with the lectures, section, and papers all complementing one another. Most of the people in the class were Architecture majors, but it is definitely accessible to anyone from any background. ",
            "\u00a0You dont have a choice if youre an architecture major, and the professor is honestly very kind and well intentioned, but with the current state of the course I would not recommend this as an introduction to the methods of historical study in architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I think it teaches a valuable skill, but I also would say that a lot of the information that is actually presented is difficult to retain and that if they really want to understand the buildings covered in the course, they would have to do a lot of work outside of class. The readings helped but sometimes they were confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course (it was fairly well organized and the lectures were interesting) with the clarification that its scope was very narrow. ",
            "\u00a0This course is likely taken as a major requirement, so take it if you need to. As a survey, the class is a bit limited in scope but certainly serviceable. For an introduction to historical architecture, there may be more engaging courses available. "
