            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of major historical events in Judaism and Islam and the historical relationship between leaders and believers of these two faiths. I learned the foundations and theological beliefs of Islam and Judaism. I also developed the skill of writing an analytical paper without using outside scholarship, which was a challenging task. ",

            "\u00a0The top strengths of the course were Professor Marcus' absorbing and encyclopedic lectures and the course packet, which compiled so many interesting readings. As a graduate student taking the course, there was an additional paper requirement. I think it may be more fruitful for a graduate student to have the option to write a longer paper, rather than two separate papers. ",
            "\u00a0Really good lecture course. Could be improved with some slideshows that the students could reference later. Be warned Professor Marcus doesnt lectures with slides. Sometimes uses a map or passes around interesting articles during lecture, but never has a visual slideshow for reference. "

        [
            "\u00a0Definitely - all class lectures, topics, and readings were informative and thought-provoking. In particular Professor Marcus' two lectures that summarized the foundations of Islam and Judaism respectively, were more educational than semester-long courses on the religions I have taken in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I would. An interesting history taught by an excellent scholar. "
