            "\u00a0I learnt both how to engage with and critique an economic approach to inequality and development. ",
            "\u00a0GLBL 335 takes a comprehensive look at global economic inequality through close examination of several books. However, the class also hones in on the various nuances of \"economic inequality\" regarding its measurement and its value (in comparison to happiness, health, education, and other aspects of wellbeing). ",
            "\u00a0Learnt in depth about the causes and consequences of inequality, as well as many policy tools that could be implemented as response to these challenges. We learnt to think critically about policy interventions and weight the direct and indirect consequences ",
            "\u00a0This course set a great foundation for global economic inequality and how it intertwines with social inequalities both within countries and between countries. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Great class overall ",
            "\u00a0It is a fantastic course. It gave us a chance to really sit with and rip apart the full arguments some of the foundational modern texts and theories. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course this semester was the size of the seminar -- being a class of only 6 people, the seminar allowed for intimate discussion. On the other hand, potentially due to lack of introductions at the start of the semester, we didn't really know each other's names until well into the semester. Apart from that however, the strength of the seminar lies primary in Professor Leibbrandt -- he is THE expert on inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa, and provided incredible insights during our weekly discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Broad exposure to many perspectives on the topic of inequality, application to specific contexts through the country presentation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Opinions on the topic are highly varied and sometimes contradictory ",
            "\u00a0The course was small which was perfect. Each session was discussion based and lead by a student. We learned just as much for each other as we did from our readings-which were in and of themselves very informative and interesting. I genuinely did all of the reading for this course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take it if you can. Every week you go over parts of different books. Lot of reading but worth it for sure! ",
            "\u00a0YES! It is an incredible course. It subtly changes the way you see the world and arms you with frameworks to challenge the systems around you. It is a brilliant class with a wonderful discussion. But this is also based on the group who is taking it with you. I do feel that the type of people drawn to this class will be engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, though my recommendation may depend on what a student is looking for regarding course material. This class was, based on my experience, relatively unique in that we read about 6 books over the course of the semester; though they were written by academics and based on academic studies, the books were written for the general public. As a result, the class was much different in comparison to, e.g., a history class where you examine primary source documents. However, I didn't feel that this took away from the rigor or content of the course, though it may be something to keep in mind for those who are looking to examine more primary sources. \r\nOverall though, if you are looking to take a deeper look into global economic inequality with one of the world's leading scholars, I would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed the course readings and discussions, and learnt more than in many other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend, but I believe the course was great because of our professor and our small group dynamic. We all got along really well. The professor is not the same every semester and other classes may be larger. "
