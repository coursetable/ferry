            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I think about the New Testament, and all of religion. We analyzed the New Testament as a historical text, and more importantly as a series of books with inconsistencies and different perspectives. It changed the way I thought about Christianity today and the Jesus movement in antiquity. ",
            "\u00a0I began the course thinking it would be a good chance to read every portion of the New Testament. In the end, I had done that but also learned so much more. Professor Larsen is fantastic and teaches you crucial analytic skills that will fundamentally change how you think about and read the Bible (and other texts). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the New Testament and its use in the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and evaluate the books of the New Testament within their first century historical and political context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read important texts. We discussed a lot of questions of authorship, historical accuracy, cultural understandings, and really complicated entanglements with Christianity today. It's made me a much more careful, measured, and nuanced reader of the Bible, and I think that would be true both for the New Testament and any sacred text. ",
            "\u00a0The New Testament in History & Culture was somewhat challenging for me due to its philosophical tilt. I have usually stayed away from classes that adopt that sort of thinking, and the niche writing style of religious studies required me to learn another set of skills. However, Professor Larsen encouraged us to spend a lot of time on our papers so that we could be proud of them, and Im glad that I did. Beyond our three essays, we had a few random reading responses that I didnt get much out of. Some of them felt somewhat childish, and Professor Larsen never returned any with feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a skill for close textual reading of the NT but also the ability to look at any text with a discerning eye. My understanding of proto-Christianity and my writing skills in prose, have also been greatly enhanced. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt to look at the New Testament with a deeper, more rigorous understanding of context and historicity. I've learnt about historical criticism, being aware of my own biases, and how much of the New Testament (and the Bible) is as much a powerful tool as it is a tool for power. "

            "\u00a0Very strong overall. It built on past knowledge, and the essays showed a nice progression of knowledge and expectations. It would be nice to spend more time in the text themselves, and maybe have outside readings due on different days than the biblical readings. That said, I'm sure Professor Larsen had reasons for the way he organized the course, and it did not inhibit my learning at all. The only other thing I'd say is it would be nice if there were some set aside time in class just to talk over and process the Biblical texts, and just to let the conversation flow. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great balance to it. The first half is spent reading every Gospel and Epistle of the New Testament and other relevant non-canonical early Christian texts. Then, the course pivots to analyzing how these texts have been used for positive or negative ends throughout history. You come away more cognizant of your own biases and also an understanding of how others twist the Bible to fit their positions. Larsen does a fantastic job revealing the unique character of the Bible, that we give it a sort of authority that we ascribe to few other things (whether you are Christian or not). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting discussion, fascinating course material, good, specific paper prompts and encouraging comments and professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Need more room for debate/discussion during class - a lot of it was lecture style in a seminar, and sometimes it stifled debate. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course had a great balance of ancient and modern texts. I wish that there had been greater discussion of the texts we read - there were many days where I felt that the class was too rushed to cover all the material. ",
            "\u00a0The class was part-information giving, part-discussion, which was really helpful. We also made great use of the Yale University Art Gallery, which was a really incredible resources and site for hands-on learning in this class. My only suggestion would be to make the readings more targeted to each classroom discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that I learned something new from every section, and I appreciated the intimate environment of our class. We were able to discuss readings and themes in-depth. Although I loved the course, I do have a few suggestions for the future. None of them reflect on Professor Larsen - I just think that he could adapt some parts of the class, as we were the guinea pigs. For one, we often did not discuss readings in class, which made them feel useless. We would end the section with a lot of material left - usually including secondary source readings - because we had spent too much time on other areas. Part of that challenge came due to the many complex themes the course sought to teach: Biblical stories, the history of the Bible, the culture of the world of the Bible, and how people have used the Bible since. If you ask me, these areas were far too much for one class. Finally, the department originally structured the course as a lecture, and I think that it works well as a seminar. However, with a lecture, I wouldve been very against having separate readings and assignments for sections. Ive never had that before at Yale and may not have taken the course if we had had that. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very good at developing ideas about themes of early Christian development, ideas of canon, and ideas of authorship. However, the class utilized a largely thematic division of themes, which meant i didn't understand as well as I could have how the ideas fit in a chronological sense. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I have gained a precious new appreciation for learning about scripture in the midst of other very different people, who offer refreshing views even while reading the exact same texts. It was amazing to have had debates about highly relevant issues and topics of discussion the religious and non-religious would have had in any conversation, while grounding our opinions on scripture and other supplementary texts. Changing the lecture into a seminar was also a great idea. \r\n\r\nIt might have been better if the scope of topics could have been narrowed down so that we talk about each topic for both sessions of the same week, if possible. This would preferably give Professor Larsen a little more time to explain some very profound concepts that I feel were rushed at some points. I personally would have appreciated some time to digest the discussions while still in class, so perhaps some sort of individual/pair activity to facilitate that would have been helpful (instead of moving to another point altogether). Some of the readings were quite bizarre but I liked that we read them anyway. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class is a great way to look at the New Testament as a historical source, and would be fascinating to Christian and non-Christian students alike. Professor Larsen is great, and does an incredible job of putting everything in context and changing your perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. We need more classes like this. The course was an honest look at the challenges of the New Testament. Whether one wants to or not, the Bible has to be studied to understand our contemporary world. This course sets a foundation of New Testament knowledge that is crucial for both Christian and non-Christian Yale students. Also, the course ends up being a mix of both Christian and non-Christian Yalies, which brings on lively discussions and a better mutual understanding of how others approach the text (and how that might differ from how you have always approached the text). ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Taught by Professor Larsen, this course was really engaging and a great introduction to the New Testament, especially for someone with little to no experience reading the bible and almost no knowledge of early christianity.  Field trips to the Yale Art Gallery were especially interesting and great for contextualizing the course material ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Larsen is really knowledgeable and enthusiastic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Whether or not you have a background with the Bible, it's so helpful to understand the New Testament, its history and cultural context, and how that informs modern Christianity. The seminar style was really engaging, and we got to discuss a lot of information as a class, even though it's an introductory course. This course will also only get better the more times it is taught! ",
            "\u00a0I loved having The New Testament in History & Culture as a seminar. Im not sure that I wouldve liked it as much as a lecture - which it was originally structured as - because the round-table discussions really helped with my learning. Professor Larsen is accessible and friendly, and I learned a lot about the Bible, Biblical culture, and Biblical writing. Although I took a lot of religion classes in high school, this one reminded me of that academic past and pushed beyond it! (You might need some prior knowledge of the Bible, as Professor Larsen often discussed religious concepts without explaining them.) ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for an introductory understanding of the development of the New Testament and early Christian ideas, as well as how the Bible has been utilized by different movements. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for those who want to find out more about the New Testament or Christianity in general, regardless of faith or experience. "
