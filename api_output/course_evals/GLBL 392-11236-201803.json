I think that this course definitely had a counterterrorism focus, but I think that's largely because that has been a main focus of the intelligence community post-9/11. ",

            "\u00a0This course provided a new way at looking at, interpreting, and understanding events taking place on the world stage.

I learned to communicate my thoughts with clarity and precision. ",

Over the course of the semester I felt that I gained profound insight into the history and current operation of the IC, and I am now amazed at how a single course was able to completely transform my perspective on current events in the US and across the broader geopolitical world.  I don't think I'll be able to watch the news or read the paper the same way ever again after spending a semester looking at the world from the perspective of an intelligence officer. If you're majoring elsewhere in Humanities, Social Sciences, or in STEM, and you're looking to take that \"one\" course outside your major to give your schedule some balance or simply to try something new... make this the one!

            "\u00a0Biggest strength is Prof Wittenstein, who is absolutely brilliant. He has first-hand experience in Intel and many of the actual case studies that we read in class. The only recommendation I'd have is to reference the readings more in lecture. Sometimes I felt like I did the readings and then they were only tangentially discussed in class, leaving me to wonder why I invested time in them (some of the readings are very long). I would also recommend more time for questions throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the problems facing the Intelligence Community. Section offered a great opportunity to explore and debate some of the questions raised in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting lectures and readings, not too much work throughout the course\r\nWeaknesses: 24 hr take home final felt like a lot of work ",
            "\u00a0The course had interesting material, but I don't think students were incentivized enough to show up to class. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty strong course overall - lectures were interesting and assignments allowed us to engage with the material. I received pretty thorough feedback on my assignments from both my TA and Professor which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0Wittenstein was a good lecturer and generally very clear, and I think that he picked out readings that gave us more background for the topics we were discussing and came from people with a range of different roles in relation to the intelligence community. I particularly liked the unit on past intelligence failures that we did towards the beginning, but we talked about a lot of interesting topics over the course of the semester. It was also good that Wittenstein would comment on current events that were related to intelligence as they came up in the news and he was also pretty good about meeting with students outside of class and offering office hours.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that there was just entirely too much reading. Although I tried really hard to keep up with it all at the start of the semester, it eventually became clear that it just wasn't going to be possible for me to do that as the semester progressed because there were often just so many pages for a particular week. I think it would be best if Prof. Wittenstein could try and cut down on some of the less essential readings or perhaps indicate which sections it was most important to focus on. \r\n\r\nOutside of the readings, we didn't really have very many graded assignments in this course. We just had a short memo to write one week, the midterm, and a final paper or exam (and participation in section). That meant that we didn't really get much feedback about how we were doing until the midterm, and I felt like that was kind of tough because then we didn't really know what Prof. Wittenstein and the TAs were expecting. I think it would have been good if we perhaps could have had a second memo assignment at least, perhaps with two people presenting in section a week. \r\n\r\nI also felt like the lectures often spent a lot of time bringing up very broad and difficult questions regarding certain aspect of the intelligence community. I think that by the nature of this course, questions like this are going to come up and many of them won't have easy answers that Prof. Wittenstein could just present in class, but it sometimes felt like we spent a lot of time just saying \"this is  a question going forward\" rather than talking about solutions that have been suggested or instead perhaps focusing on things we may be able to discuss more concretely, such as case studies or the workings of intelligence agencies. I don't think that it's a bad thing for the course to bring up these questions, I think it's a necessary part of talking about the intelligence community and it makes a lot of sense, but I just think there could perhaps be a bit more of a balance in what we spend time talking about in class.  \r\n\r\nI thought that this was especially a problem in section. This course was very much not policy-focused, but I felt like our TA often asked us very broad policy questions that we didn't have any idea how to answer--this course touched on so many different subjects that it would be impossible for any of us to be well-informed on all of them to the extent that we could answer some of these questions. Since we were graded on participation in section, though, people felt like they had to say something, and this led to a few pretty awkward discussions. ",
            "\u00a0strengths is that there isn't too much work but the weakness is that it feels repetitive ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized and talks about many important, pressing world issues involving intelligence. My section was incredible for this class and really challenged students' critical thinking skills. That being said, I do think this course would be more interesting in a seminar format as opposed to a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Prof Wittenstein who is a really caring person, and who always makes himself available for a chat or consultation during office hours, as well as the TAs for the course. The course is well-structured, but each lecture seems to merely summarize the readings. Paying attention during lecture would be sufficient to do well, however the readings are interesting and do offer a great, primary perspective of the related issues. ",
            "\u00a0Course had a perhaps excessive slant on the Middle East. Perhaps future classes could explore other regions. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely relevant and well structured! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) phenomenal lectures by Prof. Wittenstein - I was actively excited to go to lecture because the topics were so fascinating and the delivery was so effective. (2) design of the course  fair workload, and the open-book midterm and final were super low-stress. (3) TAs - Cara and Adam were down-to-earth, knowledgable, and extremely helpful with any issues that arose over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really come to mind! "

            "\u00a0Yes! Amazing professor who is so knowledgeable and experienced in the Intel field of the United States. Lecture style, but engages the students in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a fantastic class that will give you a great hold on how intel relates to our past, current, and future foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0This class is well done, Professor Wittenstein approaches intelligence through a non-partisan and practical approach that emphasizes the importance of questioning all that is being done in the community, and questioning what should be done for the future. His experience as a member of the CIA is beneficial to the experience of this course - I would highly recommend, especially to any future politicians out there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I find the IC super interesting and Ted did an awesome job providing what was essentially a survey of the IC. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend this course. A great survey of the contemporary issues of intelligence collection and analysis in America. Lectures are very clear and well-organized. Assessments for the course are straightforward and really emphasize what has been taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend this class. Definitely learned a lot about U.S. intelligence and policy (the way US intelligence is structured, the challenges to intelligence, what makes intelligence so difficult, etc) ",
            "\u00a0I would. It was a fascinating course, and honestly wasn't very challenging. It was accessible to people with no background in the subject and the teaching style and content was engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, probably one of the best classes I've taken in my three years at Yale. Would recommend for any major, especially those interested in foreign affairs, national security, intelligence, or the politics of it all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a low-intensity, high-reward class. You learn things, truly, though it is of a low workload. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend it. Super interesting and pretty relaxed course. Both the midterm and take-home final are open note, and lectures are fascinating. Professor Wittenstein is a great lecture and super nice guy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it if you know that you're interested in U.S. government and at least not disinterested in the U.S. military (as we ended up talking about the military a fair bit). I think this course would be good for students who are particularly interested in U.S. foreign policy and discussing broad challenges there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is really interested in learning more about the U.S. intelligence community and the challenges accompanying intelligence collection and analysis from 1950-present. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Even for students not interested in a career in foreign policy or intelligence, this course provides a new and useful way for looking at and understanding world events. Professor Wittenstein makes the classes highly relevant to whats going on in the world, sometimes even referencing articles or presidential tweets that were published just hours earlier. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- you learn so much more than just the history of American intelligence or basic facts. You get a deep dive into how the intelligence community has changed, how analysts think, and how intelligence work is actually done. Id recommend this class to anyone, but especially to people interested at all in political science, history, national security, or foreign policy. This is a class where I think if every elected official took it, congress would be a much better place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting and engaging lecture ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you'd like to learn more about how intelligence functions in the internal and external security and political decisions of the state. The course takes an interesting dive into historical intelligence failures and introduces enduring problems to the practice of intelligence. You may not get your mind blown, but you'll come out of the course with a valuable understanding of the intelligence community, and the future challenges it is faced with as the world tends towards a shift in the global order. Prof Wittenstein and the TAs are great teachers who make the course accessible and stress-free. ",
            "\u00a0course to take if you are interested in the intelligence community and its work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I absolutely loved this course, its content, the professor, and my TA ",
            "\u00a0This course is really great if you want an in depth understanding of how American intelligence contributes to and interacts with other spheres of politics, society, defence, diplomacy, etc, and how the whole government works in many respects. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Yes! Having majored in Cognitive Science, I came into this course as a senior without a very deep knowledge of global affairs and the inner workings of the US intelligence community. Over the course of the semester I felt that I gained profound insight into the history and current operation of the IC, and I am now amazed at how a single course was able to completely transform my perspective on current events in the US and across the broader geopolitical world.

",
            "\u00a0If you're even remotely interested in the topic, this class is a really interesting place to start. The lectures are great, and the midterm and final are pretty moderate. The only major assignment during the semester is a hypothetical intelligence memo that you write and present in section. I actually didn't mind the memo, and felt that overall the class was chill in terms of workload and didn't require intense engagement to walk away feeling like a learned a lot. The only thing I'd be wary of (which seems to be an understood fact across global lectures, and I'm not even a global major) is that there is sort of an expectation of prior knowledge, at least in section, that I found to be kind of annoying. This didn't impede by overall performance in the class, but it was just frustrating that participation in section was clearly dominated by people with previous experience with the subject matter. Section in general was unhelpfully and largely pointless, but other than that aspect I highly recommend this class. "
