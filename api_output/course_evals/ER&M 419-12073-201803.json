            "\u00a0Learned about the struggle of the African American community -- where we've come from and how far we have to go. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't learn much from this course to be honest. As a black person growing up in white America many of the stories and narratives Professor Anderson shared were familiar to me. This is not a course that you'll get much out of unless you take it upon yourself to really read the texts on the syllabus and grapple with them alone. The main thing most students learn is maybe a new lens or framework to use when thinking about the black experience. But in all honesty, go to the first day of class during shopping period and you'll learn all there is to learn from the course in the first day. ",
            "\u00a0Developed an ethnographically based by theoretically broad method of thinking about race. Learned critical and careful thinking about one's own positionality. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad knowledge of the history of slavery and how its legacy has persisted today. Though the understanding provided by the course is not extremely detailed, it is incredibly important. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the readings we did. ",
            "\u00a0The best thing about this course was the readings. A few of the texts (like Native Son) really left an impression on me. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Ture and Professor Anderson ",
            "\u00a0Professor Anderson is a walking encyclopedia -- you can ask him just about anything and he'll have an answer. In short, he has a lot to say; because he has so much to say, students rarely get the opportunity to share their opinion. It was a seminar, but I never got the opportunity to get to know or learn from my classmates, which I feel like it have the experience. The class lacked structure and we found ourselves quickly off syllabus. This class would be great as a large lecture, but not so good as a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This course is the size of a large seminar but is structured like a lecture. I respect Professor Anderson and the knowledge he has to impart but the structure of the course is antithetical to fostering student engagement. It's more like a 1.5-hour lecture with room for questions at the end. But student input is not encouraged in a way that would aid in student learning. The class really should either become a lecture or be taught as a true seminar. It would be helpful to cut down on the number of students enrolled as well. The course was oversubscribed and no one was cut. We also never received clear feedback from Professor Anderson. I never got my midterm paperback with comments and it wasn't until I made an appointment for office hours with a TF that I was given any indication as to my performance in the class. We were also randomly assigned a response paper - not listed on the syllabus- to be turned in within a week of when it was assigned. The syllabus didn't list due dates for the midterm and final papers and the TFs didn't know the due dates until a week before the midterm was due and 2 weeks before the final was due. It was just poorly organized in that students were surprised with assignments and couldn't get straight answers about due dates to plan and schedule accordingly. I was very disappointed with the way the course was run. ",
            "\u00a0The material is incredibly interesting, and Professor Anderson teaches it very well and clearly. However, I really wish we had more time for discussion amongst students themselves, perhaps even a section with the tfs. There were so many brilliant students in the class as well who I wish I could have heard from more. There comments brought up a lot of additional complexity and really engaged with the ideas Professor Anderson presented well. ",
            "\u00a0Course discussion is not really discussion. Our seminar classes are mostly dominated by Professor Anderson lecturing. However, I appreciated the attempts to get people to share personal stories. I think there is a better way to approach asking people to share testimonies. Hearing from other students really enriched the course. \r\n\r\nThe reading load was unreasonable and we often strayed from the syllabus. It was frequently impossible to find out what we were supposed to be reading for that week. Course discussion often didn't cover the readings. \r\n\r\nThe course was very focused on the perspective and story of the black man, and tended to neglect other members of the African American community. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course should, in theory, be the subject matter, but the flawed structure of the course almost entirely mitigates its intrigue. The primary weakness is Professor Anderson. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are too repetitive. Student engagement is low, and without doing the reading, you will not learn very much. It's a great opportunity to sit with a legend in the field, but lectures (seminar is more like a lecture) provide very little new information. Because there is little accountability for doing the reading (beyond surprise essays), one may not get much out of this course. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Anderson is a pioneer in his field ",
            "\u00a0You will learn a ton from the readings and Professor Anderson, but don't take this course if you're looking for a seminar where you can share your opinion and hear from others. ",
            "\u00a0I would not really recommend this course. You don't need to put in any effort into the class, but the classes are extremely boring and repetitive. You don't really discuss any of the books that you are supposed to read and hear about the same topics over and over again. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want an easy A. You won't learn much if you're a black person other than what Professor Anderson has to say during the first lecture. If you want an intellectually engaging, low-workload fifth course, there are much better options out there. You don't have to do any of the readings for the course because we don't discuss most of the texts and those that we do discuss are basically summarized by Professor Anderson during his lecture prior to the discussion. Honestly, if I could do it over again I probably wouldn't take it - I didn't learn anything. I could've taken another course and put the same amount of time in but gotten much more out of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, so long as there is more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course at all. Not only was the entire course unstructured but I felt a lack of support from the entire teaching team that I havent felt in any classes before. Also, I finished this semester feeling like I learned nothing that I hadnt known before. Although people say its worth sitting in a classroom with Professor Anderson due to his fame, I would strongly encourage you to not take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course simply because the material is extremely important, and it will force you to ask yourself important questions. Professor Anderson has a lot of wisdom to share, and you will learn a lot if you listen. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend staying as far away from this course as possible, especially if the subject matter is interesting to you. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because seminar meetings were more like lectures, and the same information was repeated nearly every time. "
