            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good survey of German culture, and it helps improve writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this course but only with an instructor different than Prof. Gehlker - while the content of the course she prepared was overall very interesting (mostly topics pertaining to social issues in contemporary Germany and their comparison with those in the US) and I learned a lot in that sense, her teaching style was not suited to language learning - the discussion was of poor quality because she seemed unsure of how to facilitate and often gave lenghty answers/shared her opinions on the questions she just asked without waiting more than 2 seconds for a student to respond. The way grammar was incorporated into the class was rather poor - if you're good at learning it at home and understanding it on your own then you're set, but you prefer having grammar concepts explain, this is not the teacher that will do it. Lastly, it got a bit stressful and frustrating in the second half of the semester as there appeared quizzes in the syllabus that were not there in the beginning, the same happened with a couple of more assignments, so if you like to plan out your work ahead and don't like surprises, maybe look for a different instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was a good first German course for me and all of the content was clear and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course but the organization and description of assignments was always very confusing. Every assignment was more stressful than it needed to be. "
