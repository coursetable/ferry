            "\u00a0This course helped us stay on track with our thesis work by providing assignments at regular intervals and giving us people to consult about our problems. ",

            "\u00a0It was great to hear what the other seniors were working on and work together. ",
            "\u00a0This course was certainly helpful in organizing my thoughts for my thesis and sorting out different strategies on how to work efficiently and responsibly throughout the term. ",
            "\u00a0Learned ho to organize my thesis work with the guidance of Prof. Tran. ",
            "\u00a0Research methods and tips for writing the senior thesis in ER&M. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how I should be organizing my senior thesis, which was really great and really helpful. It was awesome to be able to work collaboratively with other students in the ER&M major, and I really enjoyed learning about their projects and going through the initial process together. ",

            "\u00a0I learned that I know nothing about anything and writing a thesis will be really hard haha. Actually I did learn a lot more about research and writing about research. And also IRB. "

            "\u00a0I liked the small groups we were put in for this class. I think it could have had better time management. Sometimes the assignments we did in class didn't feel like they helped us in the long run. Like when we did library research for other people's projects. Or when we read a source in class to see how other authors used sources. It might have been better to assign us a little more outside of class (with the chapter) so that we could have more time to discuss in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized in helping students pursue and complete successful senior theses and projects.  I do think, however, that the same amount of success could have been achieved if the course alternated between having a class one week and a one-on-one meeting the next, either with the professor or an advisor. ",
            "\u00a0Wish more time was spent on completing our work. Also, most of us needed a topic brainstorming session in the beginning. The IRB presentation could also be better and actually provide useful information. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Thesis Lit. Review, prospectus, IRB presentation, and workshop\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Annotated bibliography should have been divided into two separate due dates. ",
            "\u00a0Mandatory readings/coursework are really light in order to give you time and guidance to start your senior thesis, a project that is largely self-guided/independent. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome in that it let you work closely with other students in your major. It was well organized and it was apparent what we were supposed to get from each meeting. The times we brainstormed and worked on our projects were particularly useful, as well as when we workshopped each others' work. However, it may have been more helpful to have students doing the year long project and the semester long projects in separate courses, or only offer this course to students doing the year long project and offer an alternative to the other majors. This was because for students not doing the same project, it sometimes felt like the class meetings were not very useful. This was especially true when we would do things that weren't actually relevant to projects, like discuss stuff from the textbook \"The Craft of Research\", which I did not like at all. \r\n\r\nIf the class structure were to remain the same, with all the majors mixed together regardless of their projects (which I think could still work, and it does create a sense of solidarity), it would be nice for us to have more time to talk to each other and work through things together instead of some of the more pointless activities like the discussions about\"Craft of Research\". I would have also liked a more straightforward outline/format for some of our assignments, like the prospectus or the primary source analysis. It would have been especially helpful to have a format for the prospectus and other assignments specifically related to the senior project because it is the first time a lot of us did assignments like that, and it would have been nice to know how exactly we should do them. ",
            "\u00a0I found it unhelpful spending 45 minutes on independent work during class. I would have preferred workshopping our ideas with each other, or discussing the work together instead of silently. I would have preferred more guidance and feedback regarding assignments and our projects overall. "

            "\u00a0They sort of have to take it as ER&M majors, so yes I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Required course for ER&M majors that provides guidance in the senior thesis requirement. Created a sense of community between ER&M majors and provided helpful workshops. ",
            "\u00a0This class is mandatory for ER&M seniors. ",
            "\u00a0It was extremely helpful in setting up how I would be doing my thesis. Sometimes I need to be told to sit and write and we did a lot of that and I greatly appreciated it. It's very helpful, as someone who barely knows what a thesis is (lol) to have that weekly class and guide. "
