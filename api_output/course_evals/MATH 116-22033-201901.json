            "\u00a0This course teaches basic mathematical modeling of biologial systems, and it helps in understanding the math in biology literature. ",
            "\u00a0Good grasp of how biological systems can be modeled using math, mostly diff eq ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze math models in academic papers, especially those related to the biological sciences. I also learned about the relationship between math and biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great ability to relate calculus to the real world, which for me was a very helpful and grounding experience. Often, higher level math can be very theoretical with no true application, but this class was full of concrete ways that calculus can be applied to the biosciences. "

            "\u00a0The problem sets were very helpful for understanding concepts covered in lecture. Sometimes, lectures were a bit hard to understand, but posted course notes helped with this. ",
            "\u00a0I think its a strong class already and does not need any significant changes for improvement ",
            "\u00a0I think sometimes the problem set questions either weren't clear or didn't match the level of difficulty of what was taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think the material tended to be pretty difficult to grasp and required quite a bit of work. I often found that I would have been unable to complete a problem set without going to peer tutoring office hours. I think a few more opportunities to provide feedback during the year would help Prof. Hall to know which topics were more difficult than others. Otherwise, it was a good course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, for students interested in biology, this could be more interesting than a traditional math class. Everything learned in class is very applicable, which can make it more rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any premed or bio major who wants to understand more about the connection between calculus and biology/medicine. I think it does a really good job of teaching calc II concepts in the context of biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would for many people. I think that for certain individuals who prefer a more typical math learning environment, this course could be frustrating, as there was no textbook and the course didn't follow a standard calc 2 trajectory. For me, however, this was not a concern and so I very much enjoyed the style of teaching and learning presented in 116. "
