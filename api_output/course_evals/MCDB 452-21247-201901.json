            "\u00a0Alignment algorithms, protein structure, pretty much short-term knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an excellent overview of the rich diversity of research areas in biomedical data science, bioinformatics, and computational biology. This courae is meant to be a survey course and does an excellent job at providing an introduction to this growing field in biology. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course provided a great survey look at the kind of topics that are important for biomedical data science. It went over in broad strokes what the field was about and discussed some of the methods that are critical to the field. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: wide range of topics covered, all very interesting\r\n\r\nImprovements: I wish they had made it clear that you'd need some CS or math background to succeed. It felt like a CS or machine learning class but tangentially applied to biology, rather than an MCDB class. The homework for the non-programming students was still a mathematical derivation, which highlights the fact that the class is geared towards more quantitatively minded students. ",
            "\u00a0Nice that they record lectures so you can play them at home at 2x speed. ",
            "\u00a0I love that the course was recorded live on Canvas which allowed me to review lectures, reinforce what I learned, or watch the lectures if I missed class. \r\nI loved that guest lectures were invited to speak on their areas of expertise and share their research.\r\nThe discussion sections were fantastic! I enjoyed reading and discussing research papers and the TA's were fantastic! \r\n\r\nPerhaps Prof. Gerstein's lectures are a little disorganized and he can do a better job at presenting the material in a more straightforward and coherent manner.\r\nAlso the class provides alot breadth but very little depth. Perhaps they can focus more on a smaller range of topics snd provide more practical sessions, such as teaching non-programming students some prgramming and data analysis skills used in bioinformatics. ",
            "\u00a0This course assumed a lot of information that I don't think many of the undergraduates have coming into the course. The quizzes and homework assignments are definitely manageable, but the lectures in many ways went over my head. But rest assured you will only be tested on the fundamental concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest difficulty I saw with this class was how wide of an audience it seemed targeted to. Like, it's presented as a class for all students anywhere on the bio-cs spectrum, but in my eyes it certainly did not bridge that chasm well enough. Going in as an MBB undergrad, the only prereq I remember listed for this class was second semester biochemistry (MBB301). But there were certainly lectures that assumed pre-knowledge of a bunch of statistical and computer science concepts that were completely lost on me. And I'm sure there were parts of the course lost on the less bio-focused students. Maybe that's the intention, but the whole thing did feel disorienting to me. In Mark's lectures particularly I felt like everything was either super abstract and hand-wavy or way too technical to understand, and in the end I feel like I barely learned anything compared with the other classes I take. Maybe that's fine considering that a huge chunk of the grade came from two tiny quizzes that tested only a fraction of the material discussed and only so superficially. And which were almost carbon copies of the past years quizzes posted on the site. (If you skipped out on lectures and just studied the old quizzes you'd be perfectly fine.)\r\n\r\nI feel like the ultimately solution would be to split this into two different courses for there two different sets of students. Is that possible? I don't know "

            "\u00a0It's a total gut. Ok. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! If anyone is interested in the intersection between computation and biology, this class is a great introduction taught by some of the leading experts in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. Mainly because the course assumes too much so that it is difficult to follow unless you have the necessary background. Neither does the course teach any practical skillset that you can employ after the course. It is more of a survey on topics that are important in the field. "
