            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical entomological collection and curation skills as well as a lot of knowledge about arthropod morphology, habitat, etc. I feel like I can now approach any arthropod and know a lot about it, and possibly even identify it. It's amazing how much I learned in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an incredibly deep appreciation for the diversity of life seen in arthropods and the unique intricacies of different organisms. I also learned how to properly collect, preserve, and display arthropods for further research and study of biodiversity. This course allowed me to learn the process for creating and maintaining collection so well that I would feel prepared to work with and contribute to a high-quality collection like that of the Peabody. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the taxonomic relationships between arthropod orders and learned to identify major families from each order of insects. I also learned to collect and preserve arthropods. ",
            "\u00a0I have very little experience in organismal biology, especially for invertebrates. I'm an English major with a job in the Peabody Museum, and I took this class because I wanted to complete my science requirement with something that could allow me to learn as much as possible about a specific field of biology, and this class certainly fit the bill. I learned to identify pretty much every order of insect, as well as probably four or five dozen families without having to look it up. As somebody who wants to work in Natural History Museums as a career, the opportunity to learn how to pin, label, identify, and curate a collection of insects was absolutely invaluable. "

            "\u00a0This class is engaging, informative, and most of all fun! I felt like I was constantly learning practical skills that I can apply in future endeavors. The optional trips were incredible experiences that taught me far more than I could ever learn in a classroom. Marta is one of my favorite professors of all time, if not my favorite. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback is that the class involves a LOT of work. The weekly quizzes require a fair bit of studying, the class uses up many weekends as well as your entire October break, and the collection requires several hours outside of normal lab time to complete. However, it was definitely worthwhile! Even if I was a little bit exhausted, every moment with the class was a lot of fun and very informative. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the the professor Marta Wells (who is incredibly passionate about the class and extremely supportive of her students), the trips and other resources that make creating your own high-quality collection possible, the interesting and exciting course material, and the awesome lab environment and teaching collection available for student use and study. There are few if any weaknesses, with the only improvement being an earlier understanding of what the collection project consists on so that less work is required at the end of the semester during reading period to finish it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong and it teaches you a lot. The only downside would be the time limit. ",
            "\u00a0I don't usually type things out this way, but I think it may be helpful to answer this question in list form. ***The strengths are: 1) Hands-on experience; 2) Breadth of material covered; 3) The fact that you get to keep your bug collection at the end of the semester; 4) The small class size means lots of one-on-one time with the professor and TA's; 5) Complete immersion in a museum collection-type setting; 6) There are lots of field trips that are all-expenses-paid; 7) You get a loaner iPad; 8) On the major five-day field trip to Florida, there are about as many instructors as there are students; 9) You will leave knowing more than you ever thought there was to know about insects.*** The weaknesses are: 1) It's a lot of hours of work, both in class and on the weekends; 2) You forfeit your October break; 3) the quizzes, which make up the majority of your grades, are deceptively difficult, even if you study your butt off; 4) It can be really gross to be covered in bugs during the field trips. When I showered the first night in Florida, I was washing bugs out of my ears and nose--they were everywhere. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale (definitely my favorite lab by far!) I'm not an E&EB major but I am interested in entomology and feel like I've learned so much in just one semester. I feel confident in my collecting, curating, and identification abilities following the completion of this course, and know that I have the tools I need to grow in this field in the future. Even though the class was a lot of work, it was worth every moment! If you are going to be swamped for work, I may not recommend it, but try to fit it into your schedule if possible! ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoy arthropods in any form, simply appreciate biodiversity, and enjoy working with your hands I would absolutely recommend this class, as it has been one of my favorites during my time at Yale. Though there is a decent time commitment, the work is very enjoyable and potentially addictive in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend. If you're even a little bit fascinated by arthropods, or if you have to take an organismal course for your major, please shop this course! It will definitely be worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Take. This. Class. I've been telling everyone I know to take it. Free field trips, a bug collection, snacks, camaraderie, access to one of Yale's most amazing professors. I literally cannot recommend it highly enough. I am an English major with no background in biology, and I had the time of my life. Easily the coolest class I've taken at Yale. If you have room in your schedule and don't mind going on an all-expenses-paid trip to Florida for your October Break instead of going home, there is absolutely no reason NOT to take this class. Marta Wells is amazing, the class is a blast, and I will likely never do anything this exciting in an academic setting again. "
