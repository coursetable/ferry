            "\u00a0The syllabus is the most exciting thing you've ever laid your eyes on, and it will deliver exactly those topics in full. Dean L is also really open to suggestions, so if you have ideas/articles/videos to offer up early on, please do. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to read and talk about topics that I never would have researched without this course. It ranged from topic focused on the body as property, to physician assisted suicide, to cannibalism and zombies. I refined my writing skills and worked on my critical reading abilities. I feel like I was able to solidify my opinions on some of the important issues being talked about in today's society. ",
            "\u00a0I'm a senior science major and hadn't taken a seminar class since  freshman year. This class helped me re-develop seminar discussion technique. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar provided me the opportunity to write about topics that I truly enjoyed. It made me think more critically about what I was reading, and I was pushed to focus closer than I have ever before on the topic of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class made me think completely differently than before, which sounds like a total cliche, but isn't true. I'm trying to be more open to new ideas and subsequently more critical of how I then change my beliefs based on new information. It also made me really excited about class and reading course content in a way that I've been missing for a long time. It really felt the way I expected Yale courses to feel. ",
            "\u00a0How to critically evaluate texts ",
            "\u00a0This class raised a lot of important questions and greatly influenced my perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about personal identities differently! I had never really gotten the opportunity to think about the human body or about the way we govern the self in this way.  It was great! ",
            "\u00a0Really eye-opening course that allowed me to perform close readings and look closely at literature while relating older topics to current political and social issues. Also learned a new style of open-ended writing which was both challenging and entertaining. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the course title is a bit misleading, given that we only read half of one novel during the course. I know that this wasn't Dean L's original course title/it was written by someone else, so I hope that whoever is in charge of course titles can rectify this. ",
            "\u00a0Dean L MAKES this class. I looked forward to going to class every week. The readings were incredibly varied but for the most part incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing; Dean L is a true addition to the seminar and made class fun to go to. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so amazing. The readings felt really cohesive and carefully curated, which is unsurprising since Dean L seems so well read. I have nothing but praise for this class. It was genuinely fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course. Dean Lizarribar is a phenomenal teacher who is truly dedicated to her students ",
            "\u00a0The material is amazing, but the themes/structure of the class can feel a bit disjointed at times ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. Reading were interesting and seminars were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: course had very diverse readings applicable to current political and social situations salient in today's news. Level of discussion was both engaging and enlightening.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps including more current readings would help to keep the topics of discussion applicable to current situations. Including other forms of material for section discussion would also make for more diversity in class discussion. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course, if you can. It'll be pretty challenging to get a spot because it's so popular (for good reason), but if you have any interest in the grotesque and the moral questions surrounding those topics, it's worth the attempt. Dean L is charming and brilliant, and the class is full of discussions you will not have the chance to engage in elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a fascinating course with a nice light workload consisting of very interesting readings. In short, the best of all worlds. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Dean L was an amazing professor. The readings, although sometimes very long, were mostly interesting. If you want to talk about controversial topics, like abortion, euthanasia, and cannibalism, and have your opinions challenged then this is the class for you. The workload consisted of weekly readings and two papers. There are prompts livable but you have the freedom to write about whatever interests you. Dean L brought us brownies on the last day of class too. ",
            "\u00a0If you get into this course, definitely take it! The seminar is so oversubscribed that it's really difficult to take, so I'd suggest shopping it starting sophomore year, that way you have at least three chances. ",
            "\u00a0take this class!! truly so enjoyable, the readings were very interesting and for the most part things I would never read otherwise. Dean L is amazing and truly cares about everyone in the class ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY A MUST TAKE. Words really cannot describe how happy I am to have taken this class. Discussion was always interesting, Dean L is always willing to meet with students if they need extra input or guidance, and the work for class was something I looked forward to. ",
            "\u00a0If you can take this course 110% take it. Dean L is one of the most warm, wonderful individuals I have had the privilege of interacting with on this campus. Aside from that, the class is incredibly interesting. It is easy to skim the readings and skate by if you want to, but honestly, you're missing out if you do. There were some weeks I didn't have time to do the readings as completely as I wanted to, but I would then later return and read more thoroughly because they were genuinely that interesting. The discussions become a tiny bit echo chambery on occasion, but that isn't a reason to not take the class. This class changed the way I think about the social structures of our world and the way I interact with others. Really an amazing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.You leave learning about the many ways our bodies are integral in shaping society ",
            "\u00a0The topics and conversations are great, but might not be the best for someone who prefers more structure. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Dean L is awesome, and the course is wonderful. If you can take it, you absolutely should. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommend this course if you can get in. This class was one of the best I have taken at Yale-- a true Yale seminar that encourages you to think beyond the literature while looking closely at the words used in a reading. If you're lucky enough to get in, take it! "
