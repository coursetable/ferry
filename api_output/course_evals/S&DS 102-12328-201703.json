            "\u00a0Having never taken statistics before this class, I learned far more about both how statistics work and why stats is necessary, especially in the case of experimental design. I truly feel that after a semester, I have learned an incredible amount about both the working of computer programs like Minitab and the necessity of using such programs to understand statistics about populations examined in experiments. ",

            "\u00a0During the first half you learn a wide array of basic statistics concepts. The second half of the class which focuses on Political Science is solely focused on regressions. You learn very little beyond what you learn in the first half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think I am walking way from this course with a strong understanding of basic statistical concepts. Reading certain studies, especially political ones, has become a lot fuller for me by virtue of my understanding what \"statistical significance\" means, what a \"p-value\" indicates, even what \"regression models seek to establish. I do not think I gained as many new technical mathematical skills as I did understand what I believe are key mathematica concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this class - one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. I genuinely feel like I retained everything this course had to offer, and none of it was information I knew previously. This class was a great design to teach the basics of statistics and how to properly analyze them, and anyone can take this basic understanding to whatever field they choose to pursue. ",

I found this course to be more comprehensive than the AP Stats course that I took in high school, because the political science section covers multivariate regression, dichotomous variables, and indicator variables in regression. ",

            "\u00a0I learned the skills of basic statistical analysis such as interpreting sets of data, running regressions, making significance judgements, and testing hypotheses. This course taught me the principles of understanding data and how to make judgements and decisions based on information collected. ",

            "\u00a0Some more collaboration between the PLSC section and the regular intro section from the first half -- not a whole lot of connection as of now in terms of content covered. ",
            "\u00a0In the latter-half of this course, the teaching fellows weren't very accessible. It is ridiculous to have three TFs with two having their office hours on the same day and one having their office hour on the day students get enough information to simply start the homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the course is certainly a comprehensive review of the basic of statistics--I certainly feel like I learned a lot. The weaknesses are mainly that, in the beginning STAT 100x part of the class, the course moves incredibly quickly--in S&DS 102, I almost felt like the class moved too slowly in comparison. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely Jonathan Reuning-Scherers lectures, which were probably the most entertaining lectures Ive seen at Yale. Professor Kelly Raders lectures, on the other hand, were not as entertaining and lost my attention quickly. I think a big weakness of the class is the lack of weekly discussion sections. Some TAs were more helpful than others, but I really wished there was a regular time where we could go over the class material, which was presently quite quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Taking STAT 102 felt like I fell behind everyone else taking other stats modules. I think it would be helpful to add more statistical tools instead of simply focusing on regressions for half a semester.\r\n\r\nThe entire course could be improved by focusing on tools that the real world actually uses. Nobody uses Minitab and working with it does not prepare you for any job which asks for competence in running statistical analyses. The class should transition to using R, SPSS, or STATA. While instructions for how to use these were briefly mentioned in the notes, minitab just simply shouldn't exist. ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is certainly in how well it is organized; if you do not understand something, it is absolutely not for lack of its availability. JRS has a seemingly infinite well of resources for every type of learning style, and does his best to render them all accessible to students. The live streaming is brilliant!!! I wish every QR course at Yale and something like it; reviewing concepts became infinitely easier when I could go back and watch Professor Reuning-Scherer do a problem or, even better, listen to him explain a concept. I suppose the course's greatest potential weakness is that it can be quite dry at moments. But, JRS abates this hilariously by not being afraid to poke fun at heavy material. ",
            "\u00a0The PSets were well-designed; they weren't too difficult, but they captured everything we learned in class very well.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fast-paced practical course with plenty of opportunities for help understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the greatest strengths of the course is how many opportunities there are to get help on PSets. During the first 8 weeks of the course (when all the sections meet together) you can go to any TF's office hours, and JDRS hosts additional office hours basically every day of the week. Knowing that you could easily get your questions answered by any number of people made doing the problem sets a lot less stressful, and the TFs typically had helpful tips on how to remember certain things. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course was extremely engaging, and having all the lectures posted online made paying attention easier. The second part of the course was very repetitive and mostly common sense information. It would be better if there was more taught. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging, not a ton of material ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the way it is divided into different applications. The fast-paced introduction to general statistics in the first part of the course is great and provides a nice overview of statistical analysis. Dividing into sections based on interest and application helps students relate the information being taught to their areas of interest or particular study. This kept the course lively and interesting throughout the semester. I also really appreciated the live-streamed lectures in the first part of the course. They were very helpful for studying and a great tool to have. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the constant use of MinItab and/or SPSS strengthened my understanding of it. Also, having all the lectures recorded and posted online helped when completing p-sets and studying for exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The speed of the lecture was sometimes overwhelming and it was difficult to both listen and retain the information. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was very strong overall. It was engaging and taught us a lot in a quick pace. I don't think there were any particularly concerning weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: practical. Weaknesses: not the most exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed that the lectures were recorded online in case I missed class! The best part of the course, though, was the speed with which they returned problem sets and exams. It was so helpful for trying to study and for generally knowing where I stood in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is super well organized, with tons of resources available for extra help. ",
            "\u00a0The second part of the course could be improved if it was made more interactive. Also, sometimes the powerpoint get redundant and do not have enough information on them so it can be hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes, when I went to get help from the TAs they said that the professor made up the concept and it wasn't an actual stat term. Maybe to have the course be more applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Because this course is split into two parts, my review of the class is twofold. The first section is very fast paced, but incredibly well taught by Professor JRS. He is very knowledgeable of statistics and makes an active effort to make class as entertaining as possible for all students. He also hosts many Office Hour sessions which make him incredibly accessible. Most TFs were also very accessible and helpful. The second part of the course, taught by Professor Rader, is also very well taught, but not as fast-paced. At times, it felt like we did not cover enough material during our time together, which was disappointing. Of course, my experience with the course might have been unique considering that Professor Rader had to end class a week early because of a family emergency. Nonetheless, the course could have focused more on applications of statistics in Political Science. The TFs for the Political Science section could have also held Office Hours during times that were more convenient for students, such as one, two, or even three days before Problem Sets were due. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course for the first section included easy access to lectures, notes, and an engaging professor. Some weaknesses included lack of organizational structure in the aforementioned notes. Often it was almost impossible to discern what information was relevant among the mess of information given over hundreds of slides. In the second section, strengths were that questions were addressed thoroughly and information was clearly stated. Weaknesses included lack of access to notes and full slides from our professor, as well as a similar problem with information organization on slides in class. Lack of substantive feedback on homework was a weakness throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves very fast and once you fall behind it can be very hard to catch up. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the lectures were good throughout the semester, but I wished that Professor Rader had, like Professor Reuning-Scherer, posted the slides online, as I found that very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like there is a little bit of awkwardness when transitioning from the first 8-week large lecture and then the smaller 5-week focused group lecture. The transition felt a little awkward due to the changing of the teachers. ",
            "\u00a0Prof RS is amazing. Videotaped lectures- so helpful. Sections is where things got bad, Political Science prof was not the best. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well organized, yet the lectures could often be dense and the lecture slides not as helpful as they could be for reviewing material taught in class. "

            "\u00a0For a first stats class it was great. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to a student who had never taken a statistics class before and wanted to learn more about how statistics work and how they serve to increase the knowledge one has about a population of people. The material was relatively accessible overall, and both of the professors were engaging and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who took this course without any background in statistics, I would recommend the class (S&DS 102) only if its required for your major. If you take it, go to Jonathans lectures and stay in his section. ",
            "\u00a0While I don't know how the other introduction statistic courses are structured, I think taking another introduction statistics class would be more helpful. This one wasn't too insightful especially having taken AP Stats already. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. To have a robust understanding in statistical fundamentals is incredibly useful. Reading journals or studies is a lot more meaningful and even, at its most basic, to understand what a regression model does is greatly rewarding. Additionally, I do not self-identity as a QR student, or QR-inclined, and I never felt that I did not have the technical mathematical tools necessary to both understand and correctly complete problems. I would especially recommend this course to students who perhaps do not identity as QR-saavy since the tools needed to do well are largely theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even if it isn't required, this class is a great class to take just to understand the basics of statistics. Very engaging, but not too challenging. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good introduction to statistics that's very manageable for non-STEM majors. It does move very quickly in the first section, so be careful not to fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0It is useful as a baseline for the statistical understanding necessary for research in general, so I would gladly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is a great second QR credit and is also helpful for people who want to actually be able to understand the \"methodology\" sections of all the political science papers they read. While the class does not go super in depth or teach some of the more complicated statistical methods, that didn't bother me at all. That being said, if you're someone who is interested in statistics specifically or for some reason wants calc in their statistics, you should probably go a level up. ",

            "\u00a0If you are interested in Statistics, then yes, I would recommend this course. However, if this is your first-time taking statistics, you should be conscious of the speed of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Statistics is an important and interesting field and this class will teach you a lot in very interesting ways. The political science application was super engaging and fun to learn about. The problem sets are reasonable lengths and help develop your learning a lot. Overall, a very worthwhile class. ",
            "\u00a0If they have an interest in statistics, yes. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course especially to people who have not taken AP Statistics in high school. I think the clarity of the course and the transparency are its biggest strengths-- I was never unsure about my standing in the class and was never tested on material I wasn't well-prepared for. The class provides a comprehensive background for statistics, and I think everyone at Yale should at least take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a great class that develops important skills. ",

I left the course with more confidence in my ability to interpret data using tools such as MINITAB. The amount of material we cover can be daunting at times, but nonetheless always manageable because of how much help we receive! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a good intro to statistical analysis despite organizational errors. ",
