            "\u00a0While each unit we covered was interesting (e.g., healthcare and business, housing, the estate tax, campaign finance, universal basic income and earned income credit, white working class), in my opinion the syllabus was too scattered to paint a memorable broader arc or hammer home any coherent frame of thinking. You'll read some cool research if you devote time to doing the assigned readings (a big IF by the middle and end of the semester), but other than that I don't feel like I gained much insight from taking this course other than a few mental models about distributive (in)equilibrium and the ingredients for a successful coalition. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an overview of the various forms of inequality and poverty that exist in the United States such as housing inequality, health care inequity, education inequality, etc... It taught me about the ways in which these different forms of inequality and injustice interact with one another. I also learned  about redistributive issues in the US not only through qualitative analysis but also through quantitive data. I can now the numbers behind these issues rather than just the theory. In addition, this class emphasized both suggested policies to improve issues of poverty and inequity as well as the politics behind it. We explored in depth coalition building and the efforts it takes to implement policies which I found very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various topics related to redistribution in the United States. While the selection was wide, I felt I did not fully get to explore some of the subjects with appropriate depth. I did, however, love the opportunity to tailor our final paper to explore a subject in more depth using the framework which our professors suggested related to the 6 steps for successful redistribution. ",
            "\u00a0Greater knowledge of some of the key economic dimensions to inequality in the United States for those who are not familiar, and for those who are a better understanding of the role played by politics in distributional issues in the United States. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Listening to two brilliant, down-to-earth legal scholars share their expertise and also watching them volley ideas back and forth with law students, grad students, and a few precocious senior undergrads.\r\nWeaknesses: This didn't seem to be a problem for everyone, but the material was so far over my head at times that I disengaged from class because I couldn't comprehend anything. I simply didn't have much base knowledge in a lot of the key topics and thus couldn't glean the same level of insight from the readings and conversations as a lot of other (older) students seemed to grasp just fine. Even when I managed to do all of the reading AND do a little extra research on the side, I still felt in over my head during seminar and too frightened and dumb to contribute or ask a question. It's not that the seminar environment was hostile necessarily, but it wasn't particularly warm either. A weakness that I think most students could agree on is the utter lack of feedback on quality of reading responses (the only assignments other than the final paper) and thus real lack of accountability to invest much time or effort in the class. This made it easier to skate by in when the semester got tough, but also made it a less genuine learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I found it extremely hard to engage with this class for a variety of reasons:\r\n\r\n- Prof. Shapiro and Prof. Graetz speak for the vast majority of class, and do not adequately solicit or foster participation of students. This makes the classroom environment quite intimidating, and creates low accountability for engagement with the material. \r\n- The class was quite large.\r\n- The readings were often very long and unfocused. I liked that the course covered a variety of topics over the course of the semester, but would have appreciated a more cohesive selection of readings each week, and fewer assigned pages. It often felt that most of the room hadn't done much or all of the readings, which perhaps would have happened less were the syllabus a little tighter.\r\n\r\nIt was also difficult to gauge how you were doing in the course, since you did not receive any feedback on any assignments all semester, and class participation was not important (at least culturally). I have no idea how the professors will assess if I was successful in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this class is great! The readings Professor Graetz and Professor Shapiro gave us were interesting week after week. I also liked the composition of the class. The fact that it was a mix of law school students and undergraduate students made the discussions informative. I appreciated the power points that were given in class. They allowed me to synthesize the main takeaways from every week. Lastly, both Professor Graetz and Professor Shapiro are amazing professors and experts in their field. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was its coverage of a wide range of issues. The weakness was surely the timing. This course followed the law school schedule, which meant that it met on the Monday before undergraduate classes started and the Monday after The Harvard/Yale football game. Otherwise, the dynamics between the law students and undergraduates seemed to be a little uncoordinated. While I appreciate being able to take a class with people who are at different stages of life, I felt there was a discrepancy in what the law students wanted from the class and what the undergraduates wanted from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A great deal of independence to explore issues of interest in the final paper (and a fairly low workload outside of it), and given the length of the paper (20-25 pages) it can easily be a jumping off point for a senior thesis. Fascinating readings that examine both the economics and politics of distributional conflict. The professors offer interesting insights if you are able to discuss the course content with them outside of class. \r\nWeakness: The course takes on more of a lecture format, and as such class participation can vary in quality. I would have hoped that we engaged with the reading responses more directly. The course doesnt allow for laptop/electronics usage, which can make referencing the readings difficult. Sometimes the content of weeks felt a bit disparate, and it would have helped at times to have some more macro-scale discussions to tie them all together. Most of the weight of the course was on the paper, so in the future I think putting more weight on reading responses grade-wise could be a good idea. "

            "\u00a0Take a look at the syllabus and if you already have an operating foundational knowledge about most of the subjects, go for it. That way you'll be able to keep up with the discussions in class and not feel in the weeds because every new concept or fact is totally foreign to you (that's what happened to me and I gleaned very little meaning from discussions). Most classes are just listening to Shapiro and Graetz talk, which is great because they're the experts and have got some really well informed and sensitively crafted opinions about highly complex and controversial topics. They're both engaging lecturers that do a pretty good job at making sure students understand the main takeaways. I appreciated how at particularly confusing times they would take a step back from complex topics to provide context and break big issues down into smaller, digestible bits. If you're looking to engage meaningfully with them as an equal participant in the conversation, consider meeting with them outside of class since it's hard to get much of a word in during class. Now, if most everything on the syllabus is completely new to you, maybe consider D&D later on in your schooling once you've built a solid base in at least half of the syllabus topics so you can keep up and not have to look up every other thing the readings and professors say. Last thing, this course will be frustrating for those of you who like a steady stream of feedback, either in the form of comments on your writing or grades. You won't get any of that unless you actively seek it out. The final paper will also count for almost all of your grade, so don't leave that until the last minute because it's pretty long. tl;dr just make this class is developmentally appropriate for you or else you'll just feel inadequate/like your time could've been spent better elsewhere ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student who wants an overview of different forms of inequity and redistributive issues in America. The materials on the syllabus are also a must read for anyone interested in the subject, and it is a good course to read and discuss these materials in. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend taking this course to another student unless they have a personal relationship with either of the professors. Otherwise, there are just so many other courses which would allow other students to explore redistribution in a deeper and more specialized manner. I do not believe this course should be for upper-level students as it is more of an introduction and wide overview of redistribution topics. I did not manage to study the topics at hand with much depth because each week had a new topic. ",
            "\u00a0As someone with a growing interest in domestic labor/public economics issues, I took this course both to fulfill the EP&E majors Advanced Seminar requirements as well as get better exposure to the role of politics in distributional issues in the United States (most of my coursework had been on the economic side). Overall, I think this was a good courseyou get a broad exposure to the politics and economics of distribution in the United States through a wide range of interesting readings and get a lot of freedom to dive in-depth into an issue of interest through the final paper, which at 20-25 pages can easily be a basis for a senior thesis. Do note, however, that the course does take more of a lecture format, so if you do expect a course with heavy amounts of class participation this is not likely to be it. In addition, apart from the final paper, there arent many assignments other than three reading responses (which generally arent directly referenced in class), so most of the courses weight is on the final paper. If you do decide to take the course, I would recommend doing the readings regularly (and perhaps preparing regular reading responses) to get the most out of them as well as starting the final paper well in advance.
