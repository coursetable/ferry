            "\u00a0Developed a very thorough understanding of the modern humanitarian system (which I knew nothing about prior to taking the class). Also learned about how to research and find information in this field. ",
            "\u00a0researching global conflicts and disasters, understanding the ins and outs of humanitarian aid ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about humanitarian aid through a geopolitical lens. It was fascinating to learn of the history,  structures, and laws that shape the work. It also instilled a further curiosity for pursuing answers in a non-linear fashion, questions and assignments were informed by the reading and what students chose to pursue which I greatly appreciated. It provided a structure to further magnify existing interests (as well as produce unexpected new ones), which in my opinion is often some of the most enjoyable and fulfilling processes. ",
            "\u00a0Healthy dose of skepticism when reading statistics on aid and development projects. I feel like this class honed my \"B.S.-o-Meter.\" ",
            "\u00a0I developed a pretty good knowledge of the humanitarian space, something I knew little about before starting this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much, it's not even funny. I ended up writing my midterm/final on a subject that was brand new for me (zero prior relevant knowledge). It was a complicated topic, and I acquired just a ridiculous amount of knowledge in the process. ",
            "\u00a0I feel I gained a valuable primer on the history of humanitarian aid, a deep-dive into the language and culture of humanitarianism, and an awesome opportunity to follow my own interests and find their intersection with the humanitarian space. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the history of humanitarian aid. ",
            "\u00a0Having very little no no previous knowledge of the humanitarian field I feel like I learned a lot about the sector, from its history, evolution and the current challenges it faces. I also feel as though I was able to deepen my ability and confidence in looking for gaps in the literature when researching a particular crisis or issue. ",
            "\u00a0unearthed an incredible wealth of information about how the world has responded to disasters in the past and how we can improve "

            "\u00a0more stability in terms of knowing what we're supposed to do for homework and tests ",
            "\u00a0It was a new course so there was some miscommunication with assignments or shifting of assignments as needed. However as it was new it also allowed for pursuit of interests that may not have initially been a focal point but developed organically. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: As Prof. Raymond illustrated, professional or academic literature on this field is very disparate and incomplete. I really appreciated his guidance to what sources of information can be most elucidating: introducing us to ReliefWeb, self-assessment reports by aid agencies, etc., rather than relying on what news outlets report. I learned a lot about how the network of humanitarian aid operates by reading these primary sources, and being taught how to read between the lines of them to find gaps or hidden implications. The kick-off readings of the syllabus (Geneva convention, Red Cross code of conduct, Barnett) provided a strong foundation/introduction to the themes covered later.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In addition to weekly crisis assignments that reflected the theme of our readings that week, I wish we were required to write more of an actual situation report for our evolving crisis throughout the semester. Most of my active monitoring of my assigned crisis occurred in the first weeks of the semester, but by the end of the term I had an outdated knowledge of what was occurring on the ground there. I think a weekly sit-rep, not just historical-fact-sharing, is great training for folks interested in this field.\r\nI feel there were themes discussed later in the course that were critical / just as critical as ones introduced earlier, but covered much more briefly (i.e. civ-mil, clusters). I wish themes in the second half of the course were given a similar level of attention as the first half. ",
            "\u00a0Simply, this was the best course I've taken, across the three universities at which I've studied. By far the best part of this course was Nathaniel himself, hearing his stories and getting his insights, both in class and during the many times he made himself available outside of class. Taking ownership of a crisis was equally valuable, being able to become an expert in something and apply what we learned to actual events. The crisis briefings were less valuable, given how much time we had to dedicate to them. I'd rather hear Natty tell stories than from my classmates. However, briefing itself is a skill, so it could be worthwhile to practice that outside of class during a tutorial or something. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nathaniel's expertise/accessibility. Class culture. Structure (we each had our own crisis).\r\n\r\nWeakness/Area to Improve: The course sometimes was a bit unstructured. I didn't terribly mind it, because I found the topic interesting and enjoyed the tangents. But, I could see how more structure (particularly around assignments) could improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nathaniel's attentiveness, care, and willingness to customize the course to each student.  Improve: the course felt a little disorganized at times, but since the humanitarian field is chaos, that almost felt like an intentional lesson to be learned :)  I appreciate that Nathaniel taught this course as a true practitioner, and if given the choice between the way he taught the class and something more clear-cut and orderly, I would choose the former. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting subject matter, heavy reading load, somewhat chaotic. Difficult to get an overview of the whole course. Some sort of summary document might be good. ",
            "\u00a0the weekly updates were an awesome way to dive deeper with our own topics and learn from classmates about theirs. the lectures were easy to follow along because the instructor was hilarious and brilliant. use of the board to illustrate themes was much appreciated. other multimedia shown in class was also especially useful to learn.

            "\u00a0Absolutely, learned a ton and really enjoyed it. Favorite class I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. \r\nWhether a student has an interest in humanitarian aid or not it's still incredibly fascinating to learn how emergency response (triage) occurs on an organizational level and the geopolitical processes that both enable and mitigate those efforts. Provides further insights into the intricacies of historical and present day geopolitical events. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. While some kinks of the teaching and course organization should be worked out (which will happen the first teaching of any course), I came away with a truly altered view of humanitarian aid. Not only do I feel like my ability to critique it and discuss it will enhance my future studies and career, I also feel like a more educated consumer of popular media about humanitarian disasters and more educated donor to these causes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone either interested in humanitarian work, international development, working abroad, data and tech, or in just listening to an interesting person talk for a while would be well-served in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Nathaniel is an expert in his field with so much knowledge to impart. He's also very committed to his students - I've never had a professor take so much time to meet with students and mentor us. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I think there was some disjointedness between the history part of the course and the current affairs of the course that manifested in some time management issues, but I feel that was just because it was Nathaniel's first time teaching it and I'm sure he'll iron it out in future semesters.
