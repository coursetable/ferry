            "\u00a0The course emphasized the importance of viewing human and natural ecosystems as inseparable--a concept that I had believed in for a while, but was able to be fleshed out more in this class.  The assignments were also focused on developing scientific analytical skills, which I appreciate since these skills can be transferred to my future work in social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt a solid understanding of a scientific approach to research and how to implement it when addressing environmental issues ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a deep insight on seeing the bigger picture of human impact on the earth in the twenty first century. Although at times I felt like the class was lingering on the same few points, I realized that by the end I had sort of absorbed a new way of thinking about the environment, which I'm actually quite grateful for. Although none of the small conclusions made by the course seemed particularly  groundbreaking, they all  sort of came together to be more interesting and meaningful than they were individually. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to research information that is difficult to find and to write to convey scientific information to the public. Moreover, I learned about the significance of ecology in various aspects of society and how the actions of one region can affect another region. ",
            "\u00a0This class encouraged me to foster scientific research skills to enhance my perspective on global, socio-ecological problems. The weekly writing assignments, all connected thematically, were a great way to internalize the material learned in class in a personal manner. It was very rewarding to write the Op-Ed by the end of the semester, which combined our newly-gained scientific perspective and ingrained communication skills. Overall, really enjoyed how this class blended the natural sciences and social sciences--Professor Schmitz made the material very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how humans are interacting with the environment in the 21st century and future outlook for the planet. ",
            "\u00a0I developed many skills, including quantifying ecological services and values in different ways. I also developed great insights about ecology in general and  integrated thinking. The course helped me present solutions to problems even though they may be overly simplistic (i.e. a solution is better than no solution even if it is not the best solution). ",
            "\u00a0Learned what it means to couple human and natural systems instead of thinking of them as separate. Learned that cod fish stocks are declining. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how the environment is changing due to human presence and how we need to change our perspectives towards the environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a new way of looking at nature, how to interpret scientific literature, and how to write like a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about systems thinking, resource management, telecoupling, and the general interconnectedness of humans and the environment. I learned somewhat how to do ecological/scientific research online and write about science in a semi-formal way. ",
            "\u00a0Research, critically viewing the world and not accepting any and all fear-mongering news about the world but rather taking the time to get all of the information is crucial. The world is not ending just yet. We have the power to change the trajectory of things. Scientific knowledge must also be a lot more accessible and state actionable steps for a better tomorrow. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the importance of environmental stewardship and the fact that humans should live together with nature. I also learned a lot about the life cycle of a smartphone from my own assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the discipline of ecology as well as a view into some current issues in the field. I found that the theme of optimism about the possibilities for ecological recovery and sustainability came through as we discussed the inner workings of ecosystems and the boundaries and constraints of their success. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been more concrete in fleshing out more the connections between humans and nature rather than reiterating the vaguely interconnected nature of all living things between one another and the abiotic factors that sustain them.  However, this did provide room for personal autonomy in actually devising solutions to environmental crises using the broad principles of the course.  Nonetheless, I would have welcomed a more policy-focused approach. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were definitely Oz, who has a deep passion about the environment and sharing the insights he's gained. Oz was a great lecturer who pushed us to think differently about the environment. The material also came together pretty well at the end, which I realized writing our final op-ed. \r\nThe weakness was definitely the structure and the assignments. Having class four times a week was a lot and contributed to the feeling of not really moving forward with points. The assignments were also frustrating and painful and I think I would have been a lot more receptive to this course if they hadn't been designed that way. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and Professor Schmitz was an amazing lecturer. I really enjoyed writing the final paper, which was an opinion piece, since it let us synthesize what we learned about during class. It was occasionally difficult to find information for the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the fun field trips to the Peabody, Kroon Hall, etc. and that most of your grade is homework and there is no final. I did gain a new, more optimistic outlook on the Earth's future. Weaknesses are that it seemed like we could have learned the entire course in maybe 4-5 weeks instead of a whole semester so it started to feel repetitive towards the end. Also, when Oz tells you at the beginning of the semester that there are biweekly assignments, he really means that you will have 7 five-page papers over the course of the semester. These papers involve things like calculating the amount of different metals in your phone and where the metals come from. These papers will take you around 8 hours each because this information is very difficult or impossible to find online. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great, one weakness is that it is a self-selective group that takes this course. I wish it were more open to the public eye, especially to non-environmental studies majors. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments need to be changed because they are tedious, time-consuming, and not a source of learning for the class at all. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that there is a lot of emphasis placed on how environmental science has public policy implications. This was very important, as most of the students in the class were not majoring in the hard sciences. The weakness is that there is not a lot of clear communication between the professor and the TAs, and then not a lot of clear communication between TAs and students, so often my classmates and I were confused or receiving mixed messaged about what was expected of us on assignments. Another weakness is that the professor lectures in a very monotone way, and it's hard to get excited/engaged with the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was interesting it just could have been presented a little better. ",
            "\u00a0This course meets too much per week. Oz should get better at packing info into 2 50 min lectures, not three and give the TAs more criteria to evaluate the written assignments. The grading felt quite arbitrary. Much of the material felt repetitive. TOO MANY WEEKLY ASSIGNMENTS. 6 5-pagers with no direction and lots of ways to mess it up. Felt like I was stressed and confused every other week when I had to write them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Os has an innovative and optimistic outlook on the status of environmental damage that was encouraging--rather than a class that bogged you down with more defeating evidence than you already know about the environment, it instead suggested an action plan and tried to give some of the tools to enact it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: However, the guidance was minimal to a fault, and it didn't end up being a very accessible class for those of us with a limited/weak science background. Os's teaching only lined up in concept with the assignments he would assign, so you'd know abstractly about the system but not about how the numbers work inside it. I ended up having to teach myself a lot just to get the assignments done. The exams seemed to also be graded fairly arbitrarily, for example requiring an answer with a diagram that he was hoping you'd think was obvious. Lastly, he's a great writer and I enjoyed reading his book; however, his lectures were more tangential and scattered, and I don't feel I learned anything substantial from them at all.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Give more explicit instruction on online scientific research (esp. for those of us with limited/weak science background), e.g. what search engines to use, specific terms that relate to the concept, examples that use numbers, etc. Put words on some of the slides! When reviewing, I would go back to read over slides but wouldn't have any idea what some parts of that lecture were about because they are just pictures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course is that you are forced to interact with real world content and research and deduct a lot of things on your own, which really makes you think about all of the information you consume and consider to be trustworthy. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is geared to a non-science major and it really allows you to integrate the lessons from the course. Instead of just learning about facts, I appreciated that the course focused on themes and bigger takeaways. However, I felt like the assignments were way too open-ended and vague, requiring a lot of time to make up something that would satisfy the requirements. Also, the readings were not very integrated into the course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures and found the course material very interesting. I particularly thought that the friday class discussions were rewarding to attend in that they were thought provoking and collaborative.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvements, I think the weekly assignments did not need to be quite as time intensive as they were to deliver the amount of insight that they did. Also, while the examples (moose in the boreal forest being one) of ecological problems and solutions were very compelling, I found that coming back to the same ones again and again did not excite me as much as new examples would have. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a Science requirement for students whose majors lie in the humanities or social sciences; I found this class very accessible as far as completing assignments and understanding the concepts are concerned.  Just be prepared to do a weekly 5-page research paper (which it turns out is manageable)! ",
            "\u00a0This is sort of a mixed bag . During the semester, having to do the assignments really weighted down on my experience of this course. They just required you to invest a lot of time in doing research that wasn't really exciting and I think the lessons from these assignments could have been instilled in different ways. \r\nOther than that, the class has left a pretty good impression in my mind and I'm actually quite glad I took it, but simply in retrospect. If you want an experience that will be tough but valuable then yes take this! Definitely not a gut. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was extremely interesting and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student (especially for someone in the humanities). Perhaps the best part of this class is that it combines natural science and social science disciplines to assist in understanding why we all should care about humanity's engagement with the natural world (helps convince those who are less interested in the natural world to understand the overall dangers of global warming). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have a pretty strong interest in environmental studies and do not mind a lot of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would, especially since Professor Schmitz presents ecology with a different point of view. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class ONLY if you are ok with spending 10-12 hours a week on assignments that don't teach you anything about the class. Basically a small example is taken from the class and you have to find data that may not exist or is spread in 10 different sources and then write the most rudimentary analysis trying to piece together the fragments that are even available. They will take you a very long time each week they are due and they are not fun or interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would not particularly recommend this course to another student. It requires a 5-page paper every two weeks plus a final paper and two exams, so while the workload is greater, I do not feel I learned much or was challenged intellectually. The assignments were often frustrating in their requirements, and the teaching staff was more often not helpful in clarifying assignment requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be more interesting to someone who is more invested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0No, I think the workload was insane. 6 5-page weekly assignments, two exams and a final project was a lot to work with. Take a different science for your science credit. ",
            "\u00a0yes! lecture is boring but its very easy; gut. the workload wasnt too much it was a bit time intensive but it was like mindless work so easy ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0In its current form, no. I really do like the concept of learning the nitty gritty of the course material through individualized assignments, but it was way too easy to feel lost and hopeless about your ability to find the required information. Os's lectures were also confusing and not engaging, and most students were doing other things on their computers. Definitely read his book, \"The New Ecology,\" though! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! It's a lot of work and writing if you do not start on the assignments early and if you're not familiar with scientific research, but the end result is absolutely worth it and the learning is student driven. Oswald is also amazing and does a phenomenal job at forcing you to think critically and is a huge breath of new hope. ",
            "\u00a0To be frank, I would not recommend this course unless you are prepared to invest in a lot of busy work calculating carbon budgets and estimating the costs of making a smartphone. The course has a very demanding workload that seems unnecessary to convey the message. The themes of the lectures are very important, but you could read about most of them in Professor Schmitzs book The New Ecology, which we also read for the course. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat repetitive but overall very informative and a good science class for those are not necessarily \"STEM-minded.\" Would recommend for a general understanding of environmental science ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone looking for an introduction to ecology- it may come off as a bit redundant or slow to experienced scientists, but it is a very strong first ecology course and I enjoyed the material. "
