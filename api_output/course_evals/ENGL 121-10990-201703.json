            "\u00a0I am not sure how much my actual writing improved, but I now have a great foundation in good medical writers. Before taking this class I had no idea who Oliver Sacks or Atul Gwande were. Now, I have clear examples to turn to for examples of different science writing styles. I also enjoyed the assigned readings! ",
            "\u00a0How to make my writing sound more like a story, be relatable to my audience, and how to keep a long piece interesting ",
            "\u00a0Great improvement in writing in various styles, understanding different styles, appealing to different audiences. ",
            "\u00a0definitely gained skills in medical writing for a variety of audiences ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write about technical science for a general audience, and more broadly, how to structure my writing to keep the reader engaged and convey my purpose. I came away from this class with powerful writing tools. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I was able to develop my writing skills and learn how to write with a scientific mindset. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to write about medicine in simplistic terms which is very interesting and fun you also learn about what Yale has to offer and how much you can weave education into going to different places instead of just reading a book. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome class that helps develop writing science for a non-science audience. I used to dread writing and writing classes, but this one got me excited for the pieces we worked on. ",
            "\u00a0I learned important skills in writing including writing nut grafs and gold coins. I will take these skills into my future writing.\r\nIn addition, I developed my observational and descriptional skills via the museum and pathology lab trips. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about writing, with a focus on writing about medical/public health/scientific topics but also a lot about writing in general. We worked on a bunch of different styles of writing: hard news story, personal narrative, fiction, and patient profile, with the greatest focus on New-Yorker style feature pieces. I learned about how to frame scientific/medical information for the public, and about journalists' responsibilities to the public. ",
            "\u00a0I developed so many skills while taking this class. First of all, I better honed my ability to read medical writing for craft, and correspondingly I improved my ability to write and assess my own writing for craft, and not simply content. I learned about the power and meaning of each word in a piece of writing, and it was both fun and challenging learning about more of a journalistic approach to writing; in my courses, I feel like I have mostly focused on expository and scientific writing.

            "\u00a0A major strength is how often students are writing. I also loved how open ended the final paper topic was because it allowed me to research a topic I have always been interested in, but never had the time to learn about. Something slightly frustrating was that our writing always had to be written at a level where the general public could understand. The general public apparently has no understanding of basic science, so I spent a lot of time diluting down my work. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: no regular office hours, although Professor was always willing to meet; having a set time a week would be nice to drop in \r\n\r\nStrength: multiple meetings per week, critical analyses of readings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great and very helpful instructor (Prof. Epstein rocks). Very interesting course if interested in medicine and public health. Final project allowed us to explore our passion. Highly recommend this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A bit too much reading and emulating instead of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I am not a particularly good writer, but this course definitely helped me to improve ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the breadth of writing assignments and activities we were able to do and the ability to write two drafts of most assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was incredible. I loved every minute of it. It could maybe be improved by having a more clear structure. I was a little confused about certain assignments and due dates, although Professor Epstein was very flexible. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall great it was definitely a challenging course but I loved every single field trip we went on and I really enjoyed every conversation we had in this class. There was nothing bad about this class it was just a little more challenging for than I had expected. ",
            "\u00a0The variety of formats introduces throughout the class were awesome. We worked on opinion pieces, new yorker style articles, patient profiles, etc. We learned a lot about medical history, and had the opportunity to go on several field trips (the British art gallery, a pathology lab, ...). The grading wasn't always super transparent, but overall the class was awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching, reading selections, variety of writing assignment types\r\n\r\nArea for improvement: more time for in-depth discussion of readings ",
            "\u00a0One major strength of this course is Professor Epstein herself, who is so dynamic and cares so much about the students and the class that her enthusiasm is contagious. Because she was so engaged in our reading and writing, I felt myself very naturally feeling extremely engaged and wanting to put forth my best work. On that note, the readings and assignments in this course were also a strength, because the readings definitely enhanced my understanding to write well, and the assignments gave me the opportunity to try my best to do so. I think the biggest weakness of the course was the slight disorganization of each class and some of the intermediate assignments, because I did sometimes feel a bit confused about what I was supposed to be turning in at certain points.

            "\u00a0Most definitely! You learn a lot about medical writing, and you get to do some pretty cool supplementary trips. My favorites were visiting the Cushing Center and the Brain Basement! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A must for anyone who wants to go into medicine and public health ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in medicine and ethics, this class is a must-take! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, it was a very engaging course ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! My writing improved, in-class conversations were interesting, and Professor Epstein goes above and beyond to help her students learn and improve. This class also provides the unique chance to take advantage of Yale's resources, including the Center for British Art, the pathology lab, and the Cushing exhibit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great class whether you are interested in medicine or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes just because it was an engaging class and you learn a lot about medicine and how the general public can view ideas stated by journals without thinking twice about it when they really should. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The class is really interesting and fun, and actually improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course; I actually have to several of my friends. It is interesting and I felt that my writing improved. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend English 121: Writing about Medicine and Public Health to any other student. I did not expect to like it at all because it was a writing credit, but it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. Really, just take it if you have the chance. Read on for an excessive amount of details: We read some amazing pieces of writing about medicine/public health/science, analyzed their strategies and style, and applied those findings to our own writing. We did a wide variety of assignments: a news story, a segment of a play, a personal narrative, some short explanatory writing, two patient profiles, and the final paper-- a New-Yorker style piece about a topic of our choosing. I learned a lot of writing strategies (how to not freeze when staring at a blank page) and a ton about style. It was a lot more journalism-focused than I had imagined, which meant that I ended up learning a lot about research and how to interview people in addition to learning about writing. Most of the assignments were short (1 paragraph to 3 pages), other than the 8-10 page final paper. There was a fair amount of reading (mostly short pieces) and we usually had just a few days for each draft, which forced me to work on writing quickly-- which was super useful for my growth as a writer. In addition, Professor Epstein is brilliant. She is very knowledgeable about both medicine/public health/science and writing/journalism, so I really trusted her, and she gave very useful, detailed feedback on my writing. She offered a ton of support during the writing process, and I also had fun talking with her about various topics after class. Plus, our class of about a dozen students grew pretty close over the term and we were able to have interesting discussions and share helpful feedback during workshopping sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student strongly interested in health and medicine and how to best communicate it to different audiences. In the future, if I ever want to write news articles or New Yorker-style articles about relevant health topics, I feel that this class really prepared me to do so. "
