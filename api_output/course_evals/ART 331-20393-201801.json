            "\u00a0yes!! if you have prior painting experience this class is great!! it is very much not representationally focused so you won't be getting much critique/help on those aspects, but it is amazing for helping to develop critical thought about your own work/art in general.  there is ample studio time in class so you'll have in-class time to work, but much of what you'll do will likely be in your own time.  you really do begin top develop a studio practice which is critical for any developing artist! the readings and discussions are not too overbearing and are all super interesting and help direct thought and keep everyone on similar pages.  overall an amazing class!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure ",
            "\u00a0this is an amazing class  molly is a great teacher! youll spend tons of time in studio, which can be frustrating, but its incredibly worth it!! ",
