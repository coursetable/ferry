            "\u00a0The ability to scrutinize global systems and structures that impact health care in diverse contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill to sort through texts to draw out major themes across them. I also got broad knowledge of a few global health case studies. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into many currently relevant topics in public health and learned how to engage with literature through an anthropological lens. "

            "\u00a0great course, very well organized- best I've seen in terms of small seminars. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is AMAZING. On a weekly basis, I think a least one reading was seriously thought-provoking. The syllabus and structure was also tied together well, so that things built off of each other but rarely felt repetitive. Discussion also had a nice rhythm, probably because everyone seemed engaged and into the material. I do think Prof Newman could have been a little more explicit in terms of expectations for the class, but she did amazing at ensuring that discussion remained engaging, considering she's relatively new to teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The course was benefited by the small number of students, which created a productive, intimate seminar setting. The syllabus was well organized and made sense thematically as the course progressed. The discussions, however, sometimes felt unstructured and could have used more direction. It might be improved if the discussion leading component of the class had more structure and guidance, rather than be completely freeform. ",
            "\u00a0The course would be improved by altering the Sunday noon deadline. In other Monday morning seminars Ive taken, the deadline was 5pm and those responses were graded. I think the tumblr deadline needs to be later and more feedback given. It was hard every Sunday to get my response in by noon and I only got feedback on like 3 responses. "

            "\u00a0the class is great- very interesting subject matter\r\nthe professor is a bit of a hardass though, even if she doesn't come off that way. she isn't always easy to talk to, even though she makes an effort to pretend like she is. ",
            "\u00a0yes, i think this was a great introduction to public health, and it really encouraged me to think about health infrastructure in a more critical and productive way. great class for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in the health. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in public health, this is 100% a worthwhile class to take. I think everyone was engaged because the class and Prof Newman really allowed us the space to work through complicated public health questions that people had already been thinking about. ",
            "\u00a0A strong medical anthropology seminar that is reading and discussion driven. Our sessions were aimed at interrogating the structures and systems that impact health and health care on a global scale, ranging from the production of risk to stratified reproduction to humanitarian reasoning and practice. The course heavily emphasizes the political nature of health care provisioning, and facilitates critical thinking about medicine, health care, and public health. There are weekly reading responses (blog posts on tumblr), leading on discussion, a very short midterm paper, and a 10 page final paper. I'd encourage anyone interested in health to take this class, especially those who have not gotten the chance to think critically about the sociopolitical dimensions of public heath and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0A great seminar diving deep into medical anthropology and the issues of humanitarian reason in global public health circuits. Professor Newman is an incredible discussion leader and really kept us on topic. Highly, highly recommend to anyone who enjoys great seminar discussion and eye-opening readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Anthropology of Public Health to any student interested in engaging with a diverse assortment of anecdotes, articles, and chapters that bring light to issues in public and global health and anthropology. "
