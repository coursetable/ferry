            "\u00a0This course is a fantastic look into the history of photojournalism and how the genre has evolved over almost 200 years. I learned about the role of images in thinking about media, information, and documentation. Throughout the course, we routinely thought about how the photos defined and represented the world, what was considered true and how that truth changes, and about how empathy is involved in the viewing process. The class makes you think and examine your position of a viewer and a witness of these images and makes you think about your role as a viewer of difficult images. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of the aesthetics, history, and politics of photojournalism in America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to analyze, identify, and compare photos. The ability to write about photos and magazine articles and synthesize contextual and photographic information. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to look at a photograph and quickly interpret it, its value, and why it might be so famous. ",
            "\u00a0I gained good background into the development of photojournalism in America through war photography, photo techniques and photo analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first art-history class I have taken, so I learned a great deal of new skills in the class, from analyzing the contents of a photograph to understanding the driving force of the photographer, the political implications of photojournalism, and the way photography and photojournalism have shaped important aspects of our society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze photography both visually and technically, while taking into account how the photographs were shaped by their times. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a knowledge of how the media impacts on historical events. How to analyze a photograph, and how different photographic mediums affect images. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze photos in context, and to think more historically about journalism, especially as it relates to its visual and photographic components.  I learned to think creatively about editorial work, and and I learned how to memorize large quantities of information. But I also learned that the very memorization helped me have a better store of analytical context, and now very much appreciate all that I memorized for that sake. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic lecture, good experience working with primary sources\r\nWeaknesses: Expected to know details of 120+ photographs for final exam, plus an additional final paper, weekly discussion sections didn't have much use beyond allowing us to visit YUAG. ",
            "\u00a0Though I did really like and see the worth in trips to the YUAG and the Beinecke, sometimes these visits felt more like, \"let's look at these cool objects\" rather than talking about them critically. Other than that the class is amazing. The readings and the lectures fit together well without getting repetitive and lectures are interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course! Professor Raab is a fabulous lecturer and I consistently looked forward to lecture. She strikes just the right balance of providing both historical/political context for the images she highlights and doing thoughtful and comprehensive visual analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were informative and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent because of how well Professor Raab lectures. The readings are also mostly engaging, and not too heavy in load. The only weakness I can think of is the disparity between the TA grading - some harsh, and some more lenient. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings, I thought the complemented the lectures very well and made for good discussion. I do think that the amount of slide identifications for the final could take away from further learning regarding bigger themes, etc. I liked the connection to more contemporary photojournalistic styles and would enjoy further discussion of those topics. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Raab is a fantastic lecturer and sections were helpful. The course teaches so much, in terms of how to analyze and interpret photographs, to the specifics of hundreds of iconic images, and the historical moments that framed each one. The course could have focused slightly more on the mechanics of writing about these things. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very well delivered. They were interesting, engaging, and clear. The sections were also very hands-on and educational - they made full use of the wide variety of resources available at Yale, from public exhibits in the YUAG to rare collections at the Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the timeline of historical events covered, the planning and organization of the course, the interesting and engaging projects and essays. The weaknesses were the section discussions which were often badly timed or didnt discuss relevant information to that weeks readings or lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include a lot of the materials taught and the way in which they were analyzed for our benefit, the lectures, and the readings. Professor Raab is an excellent professor and she has deep respect and thoughtfulness about the politics of the works she engages. It could be improved with more conversation based in the theory we were reading in section. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't feel like the sections provided much. Prof Raab always ran out of time during lecture, so I think the course would be better off as 75 minutes with no section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content was immensely interesting, and presented in such a fun way as a learner! \r\nWeaknesses: none! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Raab is an AMAZING lecturer. She is so knowledgeable and her lecturers are always so engaging. \r\n\r\nNo weakness, I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0The class does a nice job of organizing material/themes and I felt that the class was well structured. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing, largely due to Professor Raab's style of lecturing and her ability to summarize such incredible pieces in only a few words. The memorization was doable as she doesn't ask you to memorize every image you have ever seen, and the readings are engaging. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would take the class because Professor Raab is a fantastic lecturer, but I would not take it if you are a looking for an easy Hu credit. There is more work and involvement necessary than one would anticipate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this class. Be prepared to have to work hard and memorize a TON for the tests. But the material is super interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Raab is amazing and her analysis of the discussed images makes you think harder and more critically about images that surround you every day. The class is engaging and I found myself looking forward to class every week. ",
            "\u00a0American Photojournalism was a great art history lecture taught by a phenomenal lecturer in Prof. Raab. The images span a period of ~100 years in American history, from the Civil War through Vietnam. This course benefits from Prof. Raab's eloquence and treatment of the photographs, which include some of the most seminal works in recent history. Readings for this course nicely complement the lectures, and you have the opportunity in a weekly section to engage with some of the photographic material at the Beinecke and the YUAG. All in all a great art history lecture for anyone interested in photography, visual strategy, or American history from the Civil War through Vietnam through an incredibly unique lens. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great mix of history and art for those who would like to take an art history course without knowing much about art before hand, or wanting   history and not just art. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is VERY important, and Professor Raab's delivery is always incredibly engaging. Take any class with her that you can! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this as a great introduction to Art History classes, especially for political science or American studies majors, as it adds a new perspective to these areas of study. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely illuminating and I feel it is a fantastic way to learn about the United states and the world through a different lens. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Raab is amazing, you should totally take this course - if youre interested in recent American history, this class is a cool way to learn how the events youre familiar woth were perceived at the time they happened ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! As an international student, I learned about American history through a unique, elucidating, and fascinating medium: photography. Professor Raab is a wonderful lecturer and her office hours were very helpful. In general, I thoroughly enjoyed this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was a fantastic course by a superb lecturer. I have taken away so many skills related to essay writing and analysis: and a greater insight into the media impact on American history. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think that it's a great course for someone who is particularly interested in this subject area, or for someone for whom art history courses are new. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of memorization for the tests, which is kind of lame but not that hard if you're good at memorizing. Prof Raab is a great lecturer, but the sections feel kind of pointless ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Taking this course was such a fun way to go about learning history... there are so many lenses (no pun intended) for how to look back at the past, and photographs are such an important one. This course really opened me up to the power of the photograph and the role of the photojournalist. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you are interested in photography, or even history and world events - take this class. It was so interesting and Professor Raab is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course. "
