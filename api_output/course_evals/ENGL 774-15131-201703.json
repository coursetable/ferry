            "\u00a0Professor Brisman provides an excellent example of how best to close-read a poem, of how to use theory as a way to illuminate rather than diminish a piece of literature. His division of Romanticism into larger subjects -- such as education, religion, and politics -- provided invaluable scaffolding for understanding Romanticism as a whole. His sessions with graduate students were structured thoughtfully and carefully.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Professor Brisman always manages to bring out the best in his students. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were in the tight focus on poetry and the insistence on close-reading. Whereas other graduate courses have focused too much on theory or have spread themselves out too far, Professor Brisman has found the Goldilocks position. Seminars with the undergraduates are great and insightful; graduate sessions are, similarly, tightly focused on a particular piece of criticism. The only improvement I could imagine is an increase in graduate sessions, which are a real treat. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! It sure is a special treat to study Romanticism at Yale, and I cannot think of a better professor than Leslie Brisman. He has an incantatory power to bring poetry to life, and has an unbelievable ability to come up with analogies and anecdotes to help clarify even the densest passages of Shelley and Blake. You will learn more in a single class than in several weeks of other professors' seminars. Finally, Professor Brisman takes such time in providing careful and exhaustive feedback. "
