However, I do not feel like the structure of the course actually helped these skills develop due to the short amount of time to become acquainted with the disparate topics covered each week and write the specific aims.

            "\u00a0Very little time was spent discussing the aims that were developed and no opportunities were given to revise developed aims. I think the act of revision and more of a focus on in depth critiques (perhaps in small groups) would better help future students develop the useful skills the class is intended to provide. ",

Because the topics discussed were seemingly picked at random, none of the specific information discussed was relevant to my research interests. I do not believe the structure of the course was useful for developing the writing skills intended. "
