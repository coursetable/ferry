            "\u00a0Because I have never taken an environmental studies course before, I think that this class gave me a good introduction to issues like climate change, global governance, and environmental policy.

            "\u00a0Definitely learned how to write a policy memo, which isn't something I knew coming into the course but looks like something I'll be using in the future. Learned how to connect different content areas into themes, since it's something the lectures don't really facilitate and you kind of have to do yourself. Learned the importance of energy and oil to how our world functions, and learned how nearly every challenge our world faces today relates to sustainability in some way. Learned about some mindsets, attitudes, and strategies that can and should be used to solve problems in the world we live in today (in a political and policymaking sense). Overall, learned a lot about the dimensions of sustainability, its history, and how we should proceed as a nation and as a society. ",

I'd always thought that environmental public outrage alone could be responsible for shifting the world to a sustainable mindframe..this was actually a failing of the 20th century environmental movement. A combination of smart policy incentives and economic engagement (with corporations and businesses as well as the working class) will yield transformative technologies and business practices that can forward a sustainable future.

            "\u00a0This was a great class to learn not only about climate change and the effects that it is having on our world, but also, how it is possible to integrate technology to combat and adapt to it. I found the course very engaging, the material current and relevant, and the professor charismatic. I think that one of the major benefits of the course is that it is not fatalistic and it does not rely heavily on the typical \"climate change is bad\" refrain, but rather accepts industrialization and technology, as well as the economy, as facts of human life and instead explores ways to synthesize everything to create a more sustainable future. Great class overall! ",

            "\u00a0The main strength is that Professor Esty is extremely distinguished in this field (formerly in the EPA), and it was cool to go to his office hours just to talk to him. It was also interesting to hear about his personal experiences working within the sphere of environmental governance, but him being cool doesn't make the entire class. I felt that the topics were really repetitive, and that anyone that raised their hand to get points for participation was just regurgitating what was in the readings (which often times were written by Professor Esty). I did, however, enjoy writing the policy essays, but it would have been really practical and helpful to have had maybe a workshop where we got direct instructions and feedback on how to write them because for many it was our first time doing so. ",
            "\u00a0A few weaknesses:\r\n- Professor Esty has a penchant for repeating the same concepts over and over again in lecture, while ignoring other topics on our syllabus that might be worthwhile to discuss. This is unfortunate because he and the TF team expects us to know a lot of content for the exams, but not all of that content is explained in-depth in lecture. \r\n- The TF team is extremely slow when it comes to grading, which is a problem when it concerns the policy memos we have to write. Esty and the TFs encourage us to write the memos in advance, but doesn't give us feedback on previous papers in time for us to start writing the new ones. In fact, we barely got 1 grade back in the class in time for the course-drop deadline, making it nearly impossible to make an informed decision about whether we want to stay in the class. \r\n- Considering the time we were given for the midterm, Esty had unreasonable expectations for the answers he wanted, especially in regards to the short answer questions. The guidelines for the exam said we should answer in 4-6 sentences, but most of the answers required at least 8 sentences if we were to write everything that Esty and the TFs expected. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Esty and his TF staff are really strong. Esty is a great lecturer and the TFs are really helpful. I really attribute my success in the class to all their help. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course is a good introduction to sustainability. Going to class is pleasant and lectures are engaging. The syllabus is dated and should be updated. ",
            "\u00a0Broad overview over topics. However too centraliser on US issues for a Global Affairs class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the material and the Professor ",
            "\u00a0The material was a bit repetitive - and the material discussed in the course was a bit different from the reading material -- and the lack of powerpoint or class outline made it difficult to recuperate from a missed class.\r\n\r\nStill, the class was really interesting, and the policy memos were fun to write. ",
            "\u00a0More essays and papers rather than a midterm and final (which functions mainly as an essay and paper). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it manages to cover a pretty broad array of knowledge, and does so pretty effectively (for most of the topics). The TAs give you a lot of detailed feedback on your policy essays and the essay you write on the midterm. The class isn't super difficult. The material he covers is all super relevant to the challenges the world is facing today, because even if you're not super into sustainability and the environmental, you'll realize that sustainability connects to just about every challenge we're facing today as a society. He does a pretty good job of selecting these challenges and exploring some examples. // Weaknesses: gets repetitive, as others will say. He repeats some of the buzzwords a lot, and I mean a lot. The readings are kinda long which means I never really did them, and they weren't really essential for the class. I would have preferred readings that were shorter and more essential to class discussion, because the ones I did do were all interesting, I just didn't always have time. Also, I wish that they didn't just assign an entire policy brief, because it can get tedious and I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to get out of it. But I digress. The TAs can take awhile to get the policy essays back to you. The topics are too broad sometimes, and you walk out with a general overview but not to the point where you can engage in a full-fledged conversation with someone, because you don't know much about technical things. Just what you need to know from a policymaking perspective. And finally, the lectures are kind of structured. Which means that some lectures are really enlightening (and given that Esty doesn't use notes or a powerpoint at all, Esty does a remarkable job of keeping the majority of lectures on track), but there are others where he kinda just rambles about things, especially stuff he did back when he actually negotiated climate deals (but that's also the cool part about the class!) ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to sustainability and environmental studies. Everyone should take it!! \r\n\r\n\r\nIt can get a bit repetitive at the end, but the main points are really clear. I thoroughly understood the course material just by going to class. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been really helpful to get more guidance on how to write a policy essay/what the TFs were expecting from them earlier on. The TFs were also very slow at grading and turning back our essays so we had to wait a really long time in between before writing the next one with feedback from the previous one. Because of these two things, people who wanted to write a fourth policy essay at the end were really pressed for time and had limited options. ",
            "\u00a0I think the policy essays are the strongest feature of this class: they promote concise political writing, a deep level of engagement with the topic and texts, and freedom to hone in on a specialty area or research an entirely new one. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of important material, but felt a bit redundant at times. Although Professor Esty is clearly very passionate about the material, it could feel as though a substantial portion of each lecture was culled from the same stump speech rather than providing new material. The course could be improved by making the lectures a bit more focused and organized so that the class is only covering one topic in an in-depth way. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not as focused on international sustainable development as I hoped. The majority of the class focused on US related initiatives. However, it was very well taught and quite engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposed to lots of key thinkers and great readings relevant to the objectives of the course. Professor Esty has lots of experience in the field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of repetitive jargon, circular conversations and far too abstract. Not much application, and it felt that every lecture returned to these same intangible principles. Very little practical discussion which was disappointing given the breadth and depth of the syllabus marketed to us at the beginning of the semester.I felt that my grades were a reflection of the TF's agreeing/disagreeing with my opinions rather than with the mechanics or the tasks of the assignment. Some of the TFs openly admitted they weren't qualified to discuss some of the topics in depth (great law students, but not economists) which made preparing for the final difficult. VERY slow feedback on our short policy papers - one took over a month to receive a grade on, and the frequency at which we need to submit them makes incorporating feedback very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I think that one of the major strengths of the course was the path it followed of not emphasizing that climate change is bad but also how to adapt to it while still holding close other societal values. At times I found lectures to be a bit repetitive and the material was incredibly general. Assessments were often graded harshly in search of a level of detail that was not presented in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures felt very disorganized. It was difficult to determine the main goals of the lecture. Also, a lot of times the readings were disorganized and unhelpful. For example, there was a reading by Nordhaus on carbon pricing assigned at the end of the semester even though that reading could have been very helpful if assigned at the beginning of the semester. As shown in our policy essays and exams, many students were confused about the concept of carbon pricing throughout the semester. There were many times we did not discuss the readings in class or section. If possible, please go over the syllabus and choose more important readings. Would it be helpful for students to read the Brundtland Report, Limits to Growth, or other works that provided the foundation of sustainability? ",
            "\u00a0Being in lecture for 75 minutes was really tough because the professor doesn't use any visual aids- I'm not used to sitting and listening for that long with nothing else to keep me engaged, and it was really hard to stay awake and focused. Also, the course covered a very wide range of topics, but every topic was covered so briefly that it felt like learning a lot of facts and not actually thinking critically about anything. The environmental justice class was incredibly disappointing in particular. Everything we learned is the kind of stuff you learn and then think, \"well that's basically common sense\" - I didn't feel at all pushed to think deeply about anything. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really interesting at first, but quite soon seemed to be the same principles (market based approaches, green light instead of red light policymaking, innovation) applied to different concepts.  Midway through the semester I would leave lecture confused about what I had actually learned.  I felt like the readings were not really discussed in lecture at all and would have enhanced the course a lot.  The policy essays however were interesting and enjoyable to write as they were very topical.  However, a huge emphasis was made after the first essay that they had to be 90% making a policy proposal/recommendation to policymakers, not discussing history etc.  But considering that many of the questions for these essays were not conducive to these kind of answers, much more guidance and better thought out questions should have been made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n-course outlined in advance very well\r\n-easy to follow concepts\r\n-many important themes covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-the course material was too broad and too shallow -- maybe lessen topics covered\r\n-professor was a politician, which made his teaching style very much like speeches\r\n-in class, his \"questions\" was like a street-knowledge test, not info from the readings\r\n-MEMOS WERE GRADED WAY TOO HARD ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to get an overview of sustainability. I believe the workload is rather reasonable, and you are only responsible for the materials covered in lecture. While the readings can sure complement your responses during exams and policy essays, the exam itself will focus on the topics discussed in lecture. My only complain would be that each policy essay is worth only a small fraction of your grade yet you need to dedicate a lot of time and effort in order to write them; it would be nicer if they were worth a larger proportion of your grade. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a really great course! I've learned so much, and I'm certainly feel more equipped to analyze and discuss environmental policy from a 21st century perspective. Honestly, one could get by without reading any of the articles/reading assignments. Although many of the readings were interesting, they were too long and too numerous. At some point, I just stopped reading them altogether unless I had time or needed to write a policy essay. Moreover, the readings were not discussed very much in class, and making direct connections between our readings and the lecture material. There should also be greater attempts made to provide feedback to students on their midterms (I did receive good feedback on my policy essays though). ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized to facilitate student learning. The lectures are excellent and informative and the readings are useful, though oftentimes the lectures are so comprehensive that the readings become supplementary knowledge. Prof Esty and my TA Yume (Yume is my TA, so I can speak for him best) were both great. Sections were a wonderful time for close-knit discussion, and there were an abundance of office hours provided by the TAs. A lot of feedback was provided on the written assignments and midterms too, so a student basically had all of the resources they needed to do well. The policy essays were a challenging, but rewarding assignment because they are a very different kind of writing than what most students are used to. One thing I would say that might improve this aspect of the course though is that it would be good if the policy essay questions were written in ways such that the readings associated with them didn't answer the questions already. I know that one of the reasons why I avoided certain topics is because the readings answered the questions comprehensively from the point of view of an expert, and as someone who has little policy experience, I didn't really know what to add to that in 2 pages. I don't recommend changing the readings substantially since it's good that they provide so much knowledge, but what about if a few of the policy essay questions were more like case studies: Ex:the leader of a developing country finds out that a climate club is in the works and has been invited to add her country to the club but her country is a poor, industrializing nation--do you recommend that her country join the club at this time and why or why not? This is just my two cents on policy essays though. I was really happy that this class presented so many perspectives on not only how people and groups want to combat climate change and other environmental issues, but also different views on the roots of all of these problems. This class is also a gem in terms of refuting certain assumptions a lot of people probably make about the politics of climate change--likely not many Yalies know that a lot of most important environmental laws passed in U.S. history were passed by huge bipartisan margins. This historical perspective is important in terms of the political times that we live in today, and I think this class does a great job in teaching an understanding of sustainability issues that is well-rounded. The class draws on information from the humanities and the sciences to present the economic, political, and social dimensions of environmental issues, and we talked a lot about current events related to the issues discussed in lecture. Overall, it was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and lectures are very interesting and the material includes some of the most important issues coming in this century. Some lectures got a little repetitive. The policy papers were interesting to write but I think the organization of introducing them and then grading them could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of reading and slow grading but ESTy is a great lecturer and has a ton of experience in this industry ",

        [
            "\u00a0Not sure- if you have something else that you want to take instead, I would go with that class. This class isn't extraordinary, and it might be because I didn't engage that much with the readings or because I decided to keep it credit/d/fail and so it wasn't my priority, but I felt that every class was very similar and the themes were extremely repetitive. I don't think that I will take another class in the department of environmental studies unless it really appeals to me. ",
            "\u00a0I personally wouldn't take this class again. It was a frustrating experience as a student in terms of receiving adequate feedback. Not to mention, I felt that the lectures were often repetitive and did little to build upon what had already been covered in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Excluding prereqs, this is probably the worst EVST class. Material was consistently repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to students who are interested in sustainability or policy. This class really challenges you and you learn a ton about how to craft policy memos. In terms of sustainability, I would recommend every Yale College student to take a class about the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if someone were an Econ major seeking a way to integrate environmentalism into that paradigm. I would not recommend this course to students seeking groundbreaking approaches to sustainability. Estys pedagogy is really interesting because he will tell us information then a few weeks later ask a question he already gave us the answer to so then when we answer the question we use his information as our own, appropriating his ideology and blurring it with our own as students. The goal of the course I think is to lay a foundation for further course work, not to radically disturb student mode of thinking. ",

For a student with little to knowledge about sustainability and wanting an overview of the challenges our entire world faces today, yes. Really, for any student at Yale, I'd say yes, only because it's important to have an awareness about the challenges our world faces today, and nearly all of those issues fit into the concept of \"sustainability\" in some way or form  whether it's trade, technology, urban development, or poverty. The only people who shouldn't take this course are those who've already had courses (or just background knowledge) in this topic, since the lectures are pretty broad and don't give super technical knowledge in any one subject. The class isn't super difficult, the readings generally aren't important and it's not to difficult to do well without them (though they can definitely be interesting), and the insights you'll gain from it far outweigh the work you put in, even if you're not majoring in poli sci/env studies.

This class covers a wide range of interesting and relevant topics, of which you can write about in three 2-page policy briefs. The readings and lectures are really interesting and engaging. Overall, this is one of the best courses I've taken here at Yale, both in organization/structure and in content. ",

            "\u00a0If you actually want to learn and think about sustainability, this course will be extremely disappointing. It's a survey course for sure; you'll cover a lot and learn barely anything about any of it. It's also really hard to get through lectures because they're 75 minutes long and the professor doesn't use any visual aids. I've learned a little bit of history and terminology, but don't feel like I'm any better equipped to seriously think about sustainability. It's a practical class with no theory aspects, which is not inherently a bad thing but it was really disappointing. Also, there weren't really enough TAs for the size of the class. I waited weeks before getting assignments back, and they weren't always helpful in explaining what they wanted or how to improve. \r\nProfessor Esty is a really big name in sustainability and he's written a lot of very respected publications. That's also not inherently bad but the course was way too heavy on his views. There would be mentions that other perspectives exist, but no actual time devoted to explaining those views and their pros and cons. There were just a few themes that Esty really strongly believes in hammered into us throughout the whole course, and I wish we could've given some thought into other perspectives rather than brush them off as less legitimate. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in environmental governance and know nothing, this course will be informative.  If you come to it with some knowledge, some of the readings and lectures may be very interesting and you can get a lot out of the policy essays, but overall this course doesn't satisfy in what I expected to learn.

            "\u00a0Not sure if I would recommend. Course is laid out in a very systematic way, which makes it easy to understand the broader outline of the course. However, the material is, as my friends agreed, a mile wide and an inch deep. Way too much information touched on way to little.\r\nAlso, the readings were very expansive\r\nAdditionally, Esty is a politician if there ever was one. He speaks in that manner, which makes his Classes a setting I didn't really like. The questions he poses are knowledge you would only know by chance: his most common are \"where is ----- located?\" and \"what do we need?\" ...which ALWAYS has the answer of \"good governance.\"\r\n\r\nShop before you finalize your schedule! You may like the format. Warning: they grade the policy memos really hard. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES!! I think its a great course as an introduction to sustainability. Because Prof. Esty repeats a lot of the concepts in lecture, it is easy  to understand the main ideas from just attending lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The knowledge gained in this class can be useful/applicable to many careers. Workload is manageable. I'd just advise students to set personal deadlines for their policy essays ahead of the real deadlines so that they're not forced to write on topics they're not interested in at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to understand environmental and sustainability issues from the perspective of economic, political, and social issues, then take this course. Prof Esty is an excellent lecturer, and you will come out of the course with a well-rounded understanding about the different perspectives people bring to environmental issues. You may also come out of it with a lot more hope about bringing different groups of people together to fight for environmental issues, including across the Republican-Democrat divide. The workload is manageable, and there are abundant resources provided for understanding the material and improving, from section to office hours to feedback on written assignments. Policy essays can be hard, but they are a good sort of writing to be exposed to before you graduate from college, even if you don't necessarily see yourself running for any kind of office. A great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, particularly if you haven't taken environmental studies or something similar before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's nice ",
            "\u00a0Yes its v cool "
