            "\u00a0Having taken this course, I better understand the mechanisms and historicization of the global oppression of African Diasporic populations. Students considered literature from the foremost Diasporic scholars and perspectives that span thousands of miles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the African diaspora in contexts that I had not thought of before. ",
            "\u00a0This course was instrumental in developing my framework around the Black diaspora that I have been able to implement in other courses to think through and analyze relationships between social fictions and practical realities with which Black peoples grapple every day. Moreover this course helped build research and analytical tools for anthropological and ethnographic projects. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I felt that the \"Sex and Gender\" part of the course kind of fell through the cracks a lot.  We spent several weeks looking at theories of diaspora, but not a lot of them death with gender.  Some of the ethnographies also seemed to veer off topic a bit, especially The White Side of Black Britain.  Also the midterm was kind of a lot.  For example, a midterm in another course required 5 keyword definitions and then a single essay.  I think 2 essays is fine, but 5 meant spending most of Thanksgiving break just doing the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was really great insofar as inclusion of Black women, gender formation/performance, and sexuality outside of the US (Brazil, Cuba, France, UK) and it was great to read ethnographies alongside other short scholarly works and in the context of each diaspora's history.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the syllabus was rearranged a number of times, some readings were cut, some were added, and sometimes class was suddenly canceled, so often that I felt we weren't getting the full benefit of the syllabus. Classes were 50 minutes and not 75, so coupled with all the canceled classes and time spent in the classes we did meet trying to debrief new due dates and reading schedules, we lost a lot. At some point, Professor Barnes had a family emergency that lead to class being canceled which was understandable and not part of my critique at all, but in other instances we never knew what was going on or once she emailed us at 1:15 (class started at 1:30) to say class was canceled because she forgot she had a meeting (during our class time?). ",
            "\u00a0The course operates well with a small class size though attracts students with very different backgrounds in the African American Studies department. I would not necessarily recommend it as an introductory course. The class is heavy on writing and should offer a WR credit, though as of current it does not. ",
            "\u00a0It was too short a class, and I wish we had more time to go deeper into the material. ",
            "\u00a0Class time is too short! Class should be longer so that we can get through lecture but also have time to talk and discuss. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was the first year the course was being taught so maybe Professor Barnes was still adjusting and perhaps will be able to get a 75-minute lecture slot or make it a seminar but I'd say the syllabus is great and you can learn so much, just keep in mind you might miss a lot of class, have assignments come back pretty late, and might have long midterms and final papers compared to how much time you actually spent in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, particularly to an individual who perhaps does not have a robust background in the AFAM department or has not taken a similar class before. The subject matter is fascinating and incredibly illuminating. You're given the opportunity to critically examine the professor's own ethnography and engage classmates' conclusions concerning course materials. ",
            "\u00a0It was one of my favorite classes at yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a really cool niche class that is super informative and incredibly relevant and necessary always. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course as it practically relates seminal critical race theory with the mechanics of the diaspora and constructions of Blackness, two key components of the construction of modern society. While these areas of research may not seem immediately pertinent to any given study, they are quite core to all contemporary humanities. "
