            "\u00a0I learned a ton about early western philosophical ideas, and also learned how to read, write and understand philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of texts and information retention was improved, as well as my critical thinking skills. I learned to focus my essays better and write more concisely, and I learned a lot on the subject of the course (ie philosophy) ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of the pre-enlightenment philosophers and the context in which they wrote. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far the best class I took this semester. I learned how to think more critically, how to challenge my own beliefs and how to write clearly and concisely. I cant put into words everything I learned. ",
            "\u00a0How to think about thought, write in a linear and extremely clear fashion, and read with a macro perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of philosophical thought.  I also learned how to write philosophy papers; think critically about arguments; and learn from reading philosophical treatises.  The course has helped me learn about the nature of reality, morality, and knowledge, and further expanded and developed my understanding of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in philosophical analysis and critical thinking, and gained some understanding in ancient philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0You will improve in writing, learning to evaluate an argument methodically, and learning to comprehend and simplify difficult writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the key issues and ideas discussed by philosophers from antiquity to the dark ages. ",
            "\u00a0This class was my first experience with a philosophy course. I learned how to approach philosophical material, how to engage in discussion with my peers, and the basics of how to write a philosophy paper. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength is in the great material we read, and the enlightening discussions and lectures. I learned so much and this class was a great source of intellectualism, more so than any of my other classes, DS or otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well set-up. Due to the breadth of material, there were some complex ideas I would have liked more time to discuss and grasp. Otherwise, it was amazing seeing how each subsequent philosopher took/altered ideas from their predecessors. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was a strength. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is undoubtedly the syllabus.  The syllabus could still be improved, perhaps by taking out some of the less important works and spending more time on the important ones.  This is more of a problem with the other DS courses, particularly Literature.  Overall it is a very strong course. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers an excellent survey of western philosophy. However, I found it difficult to gain more insights into the intricacies of the arguments due to the lack of time. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course overall. I thought that of all the DS courses, actually covering the material was prioritized the most. Professor Kronman is a wonderful, intelligent, and passionate teacher. You are very lucky if you get him. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very effective at demonstrating the general trends and key ideas in early philosophy. It could be improved by better coordinating that content discussed in the sections and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course included the breadth of material we digested during the semester, and the quality of discussion facilitated by my professor. If there were any weaknesses, I would say it would be the depth sacrificed at times in order to move through all of the slated material. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! The readings are fascinating and much of it, if you dig in deeply, will really mess with your mind in a fun way. It's a lot of work but it's totally worth it, and writing essays helps you understand what you think and allows you to deeply understand an argument which has much more depth than may originally meet the eye. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Taking this class with Professor Kronman has been one of the finest privileges of my Yale experience thus far. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend Directed Studies as a whole to someone who is already interested in the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, as it gave a comprehensive overview of Western Ancient philosophy, covering both breadth and depth. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend DS Philosophy without question.  I would hesitate, however, to recommend DS to incoming students.  Because all the courses are seminars, the section leader and the students in one's section can make or break that particular class.  Also, DS students tend to be a certain way that some may find more displeasing than others.  I would only recommend DS to someone who is genuinely curious about Western thought and is capable of dealing with the workload, which means both writing papers and reading long works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I genuinely enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Philosophy most changed my learning style and my way of evaluating the world around me. You will enjoy philosophy even more with Kronman as your professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, primarily because I feel better prepared to write about and understand the content in other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think both the course itself and the professor made this course phenomenal. I was exposed to a completely new tenet of the humanities and it fundamentally changed my thought processes for approaching this material for the better. "
