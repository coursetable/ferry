            "\u00a0I had never taken a film studies course, and now I wish I could major in the field! \r\n\r\nI developed knowledge about the Hollywood industry, the history of motion pictures, and how to close analyze a film! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about film. As a new comer to film courses, this experience opened me the door to view the films with different perspectives other than just a casual viewer. Also, I gained much insights about the future development of the film industry and also the past history of it. It is indeed a delightful course for me. ",
            "\u00a0Just take this course. Masha is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Global Hollywood made me look at films in new ways. Instead of merely pointing fingers at the endless pitfalls endemic to Hollywood flicks, the course meaningfully explored how each film positions itself with the world and the different stakes involved from those relationships. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a perfect course in almost every respect. The only think I may say would be to contain discussions a little more- we frequently ran over time. But, then again, I loved all our discussions and I was frequently one of the ones going over board! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very interactive, students and instructor are passionate\r\nWeakness: could have better equipment, especially projectors ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses!! ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of Global Hollywood was by far the quality of teaching, and the resulting classroom environment which welcomed different perspectives and questions. \r\n\r\nThe only limitations of the course are those that come naturally with the abridged schedule of summer session.

            "\u00a0Sure, no matter you are a student studying film or a student from other major, as long as you like film, i would suggest you to join this course. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend Global Hollywood to another student because Masha is a fantastic instructor and incredible person! "
