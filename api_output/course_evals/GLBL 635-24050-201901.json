            "\u00a0My biggest takeaway from the course is that the private industry need not be detrimental to society to maximize their profits and many of its unique aspects can be leveraged to result in social goods. I learned how to analyze investment opportunities (though the final project) while also introspecting my own life regarding how my interests align with something that is greater than myself. My biggest insight from this course was the different ways in which business can align their profits with their mission and the tradeoffs associated with it. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: impact investing, entrepreneurship, social enterprise, theoretical frameworks for better leadership and decision making\r\nSkills: communication, some basic financial skills, presentation skills\r\nInsights: personal insights about career aspirations (from early and final classes) and about life philosophy ",
            "\u00a0Self-reflection on what I want to do with my life.  Good practice working with others and thinking from others' perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the various ways in which social enterprises, NGOs, philanthropies, impact investing funds, and other organizations deal with the tension between profit and purpose. I learned a great deal about how we can distinguish and categorize organizations based on their commitment to social impact. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a lot about business/investing/and finance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal in this course - I didn't know anything about social impact investing and/or much about social impact companies prior to taking the course, so it helped me to be able to (at least begin to) speak that language.  I also really enjoyed and benefited from working with others across different disciplines - to understand how they think about how to approach a given issue, how to conduct group work, etc. ",
            "\u00a0An introduction to what it means for a business to align profit and purpose, and think about purpose as an investor or future entrepreneur/leader. ",
            "\u00a0This class changed the way that I thought about the world, my self, and my future. I gained tools/perspective that I will carry with me forever. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings are interesting and don't require a significant amount of time. The guest speakers are wonderful and there was a lot to learn from them. Blair is also very accessible and her desire to present class materials in unique ways are also great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the case studies to require too much time from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly strengths! It is one of the classes where you get out what you put in. Blair is a great person and that comes out in the way she leads class conversations. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were good and the guest speakers were great.  I didn't find the assignments that interesting.  Would have enjoyed learning more about the projects and interests of my classmates.  Everyone in the class was very special but there wasn't time for everyone to shine and share from their own experiences enough in an in-depth way.  That said, it was still my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The initial few classes did an excellent job in priming the class into thinking about why and how we even start to think about purpose in conjunction with profit. Guest speakers were well-prepared and engaged, and they added a refreshing dimension to the class discussions/materials. The topics were also extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions could be better structured - sometimes I felt that the discussions were led astray, and it could be easily avoided if the class had a solid outline of how the discussions will take place. There was always a lot to talk about, and managing how these topics are addressed could be key to improved learning. The way the readings are discussed could be improved as well. Perhaps it would be helpful to provide students with key questions before they do the readings so that they can start thinking about these issues as they do the readings. The case study presentations were helpful, but I wasn't sure if we were entirely prepared to take on the final exam. The class would have greatly benefitted from Blair's expertise and experience, and doing a quick guided workshop/simulation on 'nuts and bolts of impact investing fund' (touching upon strategy building, creating frameworks for funding, key things to consider, talent recruitment, relationship building) could have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was great. The final project seemed a little disjointed from the rest of the class - there seemed to be too much focus on technical details of constructing a portfolio of impact investments that we did not cover. I suggest making the final project more focused on evaluation of investment opportunities and impact and less about constructing a fund ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - a wide range of topics and a diversity of readings/perspectives. The professor's perspective was also really helpful and interesting, and it's always beneficial to have a professor with real, lived and professional experience of the topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes the professor delved a little too deep into her own opinions of things, which was admittedly sometimes helpful but also sometimes limiting. In terms of content and readings, I don't have any weaknesses on which to comment. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a pretty general overview. It felt a little surface level, and I felt like it was commentary on businesses who dont fully align profit and purpose (which I dont think is fully fair). ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent, the readings are amazing, the class discussions are rich, the diversity of students is amazing, and the professor is exceptional. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this course teaches students how to think differently about the role of the private sector for the purpose on creating a meaningful impact to society. I believe that it presents an alternate narrative to current thinking about the private sector and encourages a more nuanced view about how we can leverage its strengths. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! One of my favorite classes! Again, you get out what you put in! 1) if you are at all interested in the \"social impact industry,\" definitely take this course. There are very few classes at Yale through which to get a broad overview of the industry, especially on the macro-scale.  2) if you are at all interested in development, take this course. There are some helpful readings/frameworks that apply to development and, of course, there is significant overlap between development and private sector impact industries. 3) if you are into business at all, take this class. Your opinions on good/responsible business might change; your views on capitalism might change; your views on consulting might change.\r\n\r\nThis class has something for everyone, and give you lots of very interesting readings/discussion from which to learn and take something. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I liked the introspective nature of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be advised that there is very little technical component to this class. You will walk away with general knowledge of social enterprises/impact investing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Blair is a fantastic teacher and the course allows students to reflect on their careers/ideas of success. ",
            "\u00a0Great primer into the world of impact investing ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning about social impact investments and, more importantly, some of the larger philosophical questions underpinning this practice, I would definitely recommend this course.  It really helps you to think critically about certain companies in this space and how they measure impact. The guest speakers were also on the whole really wonderful and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I think its a good course for someone who hasnt really thought about these principles before and for folks who dont already engage in these topics. The case studies are interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The class really helped me hone my personal methodology with regards to business and also allowed me to hone skills related to pitching business ideas and investment strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone/anyone. "
