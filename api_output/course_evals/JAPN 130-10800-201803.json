Nishimura Sensei is also a very dedicated teacher who gives a lot of thorough feedback.\r\n\r\nThe only 'weakness' is that it is quite a lot of daily work, which can be quite the time-crunch when it coincides with other activities that you may have during certain weeks, but I guess that's true for any language.
