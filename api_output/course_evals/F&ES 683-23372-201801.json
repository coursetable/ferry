            "\u00a0I learned about the ecological, social and economic components that should be considered when planning, designing or undertaking landscape restoration in the tropics. I learned to think critically about restoration projects and their impacts on the landscapes and communities in the area. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about tropical ecosystems and how to manage them. We covered some very interesting subjects and I grew and learning significantly from the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0How think about restoration ",
            "\u00a0This course was much more social science-y than I expected, in a good way. I learned a lot about balancing different values in tropical forests, and how to restore forest functions with different levels of resources. ",
            "\u00a0Theoretical and practical knowledge on restoration; insight into the lesser-discussed aspects surrounding restoration, such as social context, project management, and funding; insight into the many objectives of restoration ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the social dimensions surrounding a restoration project effect the project itself. I also learned about tropical ecology/silviculture. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Learned the specifics of restoration techniques and talked a lot about the social impacts of such techniques. I expected this class to be more straight lecture but Mark and Gillian introduced an element of discussion which was much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Better theoretical knowledge of the fundamentals of tropical forestry restoration, job opportunities in the space, and connections to working professionals. ",
            "\u00a0I had previously taken courses on tropical ecology, and this course challenged me in moving forward from single-sided scientific solutions to actual implementation of restoration projects in tropical ecosystems. The field trip to Panama provided me with enough practical tools that married perfectly with the theoretical background studied during the first half of the semester.\r\nAlthough there was an overwhelming amount of information provided by Dr. Ashton and by Elti, I enjoyed the flipped-nature of the course, having online materials provided in preparation for every discussion. ",
            "\u00a0As a practical course on ongoing forest restoration efforts it was nice to hear insights from around the world and also share some personal experiences. "

            "\u00a0I think they aligned pretty well with my expectations. I learned more about silvopastoral systems than I ever thought I would! ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: structure of ecological baseline at the beginning of the semester and then delving into components later; guest lecturers; ample time given to group discussion and student's own previous experiences in this field\r\nWeaknesses: some course topics were repetitive, especially the classroom lectures during the Panama field course\r\nImprovements: consider consolidating the amount of assignment for this class, or else consider designating this as 4 credits instead of 3 ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: readings were all excellent and class structure was great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: journals due at noon on Sunday was difficult. Literally any other time would be better. Perhaps Friday at noon instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include how well structured and organized the course was, the various perspectives that were brought in over zoom, the quality of the readings. Weakness was the regular discussion question postings and lit review assignments, which felt a little unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the course at times. Also asking for a final presentation, paper, and take-home is a heavy lift for many. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice of the presentations from the guests every week could be made available in the platform. Sometimes I felt that, because of the incredible amount of information available, i need some time to digest what was shared in class... "

The course resulted in a complete gain, given that many of the people enrolled not only were interested in tropical restoration, but many had previous relevant experience in the field. The discussions were fascinating and extremely engaging, and Dr. Ahton's expertise is invaluable. ",
