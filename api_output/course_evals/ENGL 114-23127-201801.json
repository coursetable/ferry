            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the organization and the pacing. \r\nThe weaknesses are numerous. They include the unreasonable amount of work compared to other sections, most of it busy work that did not improve our writing. Some sections of ENGL 114 had a 400 word annotated bibliography due, ours had a 1200 word annotated bibliography due. No other sections that I am aware of had to write cover letters for their essays, we had to write a cover letter containing very specific details for every draft and every essay. Another weakness is the unclear and unhelpful feedback. A third weakness is the arbitrary and extremely harsh grading. Some minor assignments received very low grades with basically no explanation.

            "\u00a0This course is extremely hard. However, you will learn a great amount about effective writing techniques, and be able to learn from one of the best professors in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. This course did teach me some writing skills, but was not enjoyable whatsoever. It was the worst class I have taken so far at Yale. The workload was completely unreasonable, especially given that much of it was busy work. For example we had to write a cover letter for every draft and every essay, something NO OTHER english 114 section had to do. For the annotated bibliography, something most english 114 sections must write around 400 words, we had to write 1200. This was while we were already working on another essay draft. I do not mind a large workload for a class but if it does not contribute to our learning (the cover letters seemed pointless) then there is no reason. Jami Carlacio gave very unhelpful feedback and was incredibly passive aggressive and rude to students, scolding you for being late if you arrived at 8:59 for a 9:00 AM section. Her grading is arbitrary and incredibly harsh, points were taken off of minor \"fun\" assignments for tiny errors or just without explanation. You get the feeling that she thinks that by giving students low grades they will be challenged to learn. However, this doesn't work if the students arent told clearly how to improve. "
