            "\u00a0I took Italian in high school and felt like I was losing it in college.

I also got a brief introduction to translation work and some of the specific challenges faced by translators from Italian to English. ",

We enhanced oral skills every class through both fun speaking and creative writing exercises and through discussing the readings.

            "\u00a0I liked this course a lot. Megan was so kind and was really interesting to listen to when she spoke about the semantics of language (she's a nerd in the best possible way!). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: quality and length of the texts are perfect for discussion, making entire works accessible (rather than only reading excerpts); size of the class; interdisciplinary nature of the lectures and readings; openness of the instructor to student interests; mixed media (songs, pieces, performances, plays, videos, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: none? ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely well designed and the texts were well chosen for readers levels and to accommodate the variety of levels in the class. Teaching was very strong, feedback was clear, direct and helpful, and class was consistently enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great-I felt intellectually engaged by the readings, discussions, and translation project, which were accessible to everyone, regardless of their major. There isn't a ton of work in this course, which makes it a great fifth class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, it was pretty great.  The workload was perfect, always just enough to keep engaged and on track but not too much to be overwhelming.  The small seminar was a fun group to be with and the style of class was perfect for improving our speaking and writing skills while learning about the great 20th century Italian writers. No complaints. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class to take as a fifth class. It is intellectually engaging and doesn't require too much work. The low workload actually produced better class discussions than more intensive reading classes that I've taken. Your Italian will improve a lot, especially your literary and descriptive vocabulary.
