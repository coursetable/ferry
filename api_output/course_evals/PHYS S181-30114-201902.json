            "\u00a0Professor is very passionate about the material and wants students to both appreciate and understand everything taught in class. Daily quizzes felt a bit much at times but helped reinforce the material taught in the previous class. Homework assignments and exams were fair but sometimes the due dates for homework assignments conflicted with the ability to prepare well for exams. It also would've been better if lectures included more problem-solving. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well set upin particular, Marco's teaching strategies were some of the best I have ever seen. It helped me to learn and master really difficult material in a condensed period of time. ",
            "\u00a0The content given, along with the instruments used (book, homework, problem sets, readings...), are two of the biggest strengths of the course. "

            "\u00a0Only as a pre-requisite, or if you're super interested in basic physics. ",
            "\u00a0Although like any summer class the course was fast-paced and wasn't able to cover all the topics covered in the same class during the regular school year, I felt the course provided a nice survey of the fundamentals of E&M. This is especially true since the few topics the course did cover were covered extremely in depth. Also the professor's number one priority is to make sure you understand the material, so there's almost no chance you'll get lost in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, because it teaches you many of the necessary physical and calculus concepts needed in a wide range of scientific disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Completely, as it helps the student gain a lot of insight on Physics, electromagnetism and waves, and make them interiorize those pieces of information so they can use them further in their degree and career. "
