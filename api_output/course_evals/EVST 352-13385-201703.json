            "\u00a0I gained insight into the making of documentary films, the portrayals and manipulation of information on food systems in contemporary documentaries, and into popular conceptions of food issues. It was also useful to be in a discussion course with mostly students with little to no prior coursework on food issues, unlike myself, to see how they approach the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I gained very important knowledge about the U.S. agricultural system and the current state of the multifaceted food movement (organic, local, no-GMO, farm labor rights, vegetarian/vegan) and gained skills in critical analysis of film. Insights included an understanding of the complex process of food production, the shape of rural America vs urban America, and the power of filmmakers to exploit their interviewees/characters as well as audience. ",
            "\u00a0Had the chance to watch food documentaries weekly and talk about them. However, I didn't learn a ton of content or analytical skills ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of how to watch/think about documentaries critically; how documentarians think of and produce their films; and just how many huge problems and inadequately small solutions exist in the American food system. ",
            "\u00a0So much! This is the kind of class where you don't realize how much you've learned until near the end, but I realized that I had learned so much about food systems! I mean, we watch a different food documentary each week, and they're very educational, so first of all you learn a lot from that. Especially if you didn't know much about food systems before! I also learned a bit about documentary filmmaking and the kinds of questions you must ask as a filmmaker and a viewer-big macro level stuff more than the details of the craft. It was really cool! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about food systems, particularly in the U.S., and how they influence and are influenced by culture, money, government, health issues, workers' rights, animal rights, and more. I came into the class having very little knowledge of the U.S. food system, but I now feel that I understand it much better and appreciate the complexities involved. Also, since we learned about food systems through watching documentary films, I gained a much better understanding of documentaries - including understanding how filmmakers can manipulate the information they portray. All in all, a spectacular class that portrayed a great amount of information and involved interesting discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about both the basics of documentary making and about various issues in the food industry such as environmental impacts, food scarcity, and obesity. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely phenomenal course on our food system. A class that looks at something so vital to our lives through an engaging lens (documentary films). ",
            "\u00a0Food and Documentary is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. A must take before you graduate. Basically gives you a basic rundown of our food process in the United States and how it is somewhat corrupt. Will open your eyes to many issues you may not have been aware of. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: diverse and interesting documentaries, insights from an interesting and relatable practitioner, a good broad introduction to food issues, reasonable workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussions not always very engaging, readings varied in usefulness (with Intro to Documentary book feeling mostly unhelpful)\r\n\r\nA main way I would potentially like to see the course be improved would be to find ways to better engage different experience levels with the topics. I think the course was far better an intro course than a discussion one. In some ways it could have been very useful and interesting to have at least a few more lecture-style portions of the course from the professor. Even just 20 minutes or so every few classes to hear from him on a topic would have been cool and more useful than the student presentations. \r\nDiscussions could also perhaps have been more directed at times, perhaps with occasional incisive discussion questions for guiding things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - relaxed atmosphere, every student had to give an individual presentation, mandatory film screenings, non-graded quizzes for accountability\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - less engagement with readings, less focused in-class discussion that left more questions unanswered or unexplored ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Ian picks great documentaries. Ian is an interesting guy and it's fun to hear his thoughts in class. Ian brings in guests related to the movies (often the filmmakers) to Skype to the class and these can be interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Ian is not a great discussion leader so discussions can be rambling and not very interesting. This year about 1/3 of the class was very knowledgeable about the food system and issues in food and agriculture while for 2/3 of the class this was their first introduction to the topic. This made having discussions that were interesting for the whole class difficult. The discussions also stayed very much surface level and didn't delve deeper into issues of the food system or the documentaries themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class overall! I found most of the documentaries interesting, and liked getting to know my classmates and Ian better. Class presentations were fun to create and watch alike. My main qualm is that discussion was somewhat scattered, and I felt as though we could have gone deeper most weeks. This complaint, of course, is in part my own fault: I study food and agriculture as my primary academic subject, and knew going into this class that it was more a broadstrokes seminar for seniors looking for a fun class to take. Overall, the class was a treat! ",
            "\u00a0This isn't really a \"weakness\" but I personally would have liked to have more of a film focus. I know this class isn't listed under the film department, but I think it would be really cool if it were. I would have loved more of a look into the filming side. I think Ian kind of assumed we weren't interested in that, but I think a lot of people actually would have been. Also, other than the Pollan book and a bit of Nichols it seemed like a lot of the readings maybe weren't super necessary? But I did appreciate that Ian didn't really focus too much on the readings. I super appreciated that. The little quiz thing was cute and the perfect accountability test for the readings because it was pretty no stakes and that was perfect for this course. The discussions were usually pretty good, although occasionally boring, but that happens. Ian was a great facilitator and I think the good discussions were a result of the people in the class who were really interested in it. I think however that as far as food systems debate, the discussions were pretty one-sided--everyone was pretty environmentally conscious and had generally the same take on what is \"bad\" versus \"good.\" This is obviously a self-selecting class, but I think it would have been interesting to have more two-sided discussions with a little more debate--ie from people who had different views of the environment and were maybe a little less crunchy. ",
            "\u00a0The movies selected were great and Ian is very smart. However, for some reason we spent the entire semester listening to the voices of our classmates instead of him. 2 15 minute presentations every single class by a classmate is an excruciatingly boring and intellectually useless exercise. Also, it would have been great to watch the in class movie excerpts he planned for but never had time for. I liked the class because of the movies - but more stimulating class and discussion would be great. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a good balance of understanding documentary filmmaking and  understanding the food industry. I think it could be improved by providing a little more guidance on the papers, especially the last one. ",
            "\u00a0Really good class overall. It was well structured and the documentaries were great and informative. Professor Cheney offered wonderful insight and gave good feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: hilarious professor, great central theme, well-selected students, good student presentations every week, fascinating documentary films\r\nWeaknesses: can feel redundant at times ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Extremely interesting and Ian Chenney always keeps things fun with his great sense of humor. Really opens your eyes to the food industry in our country. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend Food & Documentary, but depending on your background in food issues, you'll take very different things out of the course and it may not be for you. It's a great introduction to food issues and a low work-load opportunity to learn, watch documentaries, and get to know a great and interesting professor/filmmaker/alum. Ian is awesome and makes the course good. However, discussions were often uninteresting if you knew more coming in/had a more critical background on food issues. Watching the documentaries and seeing what people with less background thought of them were definitely worthwhile though. \r\n\r\n3 short papers, 1 low-pressure presentation, weekly documentaries, light readings. Definitely very doable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for someone interested in food and looking for a less stressful 5th class ",
            "\u00a0If you haven't studied food and agriculture before and are looking for introduction to topics about the food system I would recommend this course. Otherwise I would not ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Ian is really knowledgeable and entertaining, and, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the American food system, you'll learn a hell of a lot. Assignments and class presentations are rewarding and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend taking this course, its a fun and interesting way to understand the American food system. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was super fun and I also learned a lot! It's not a joke but it's also not too hard-the workload is very reasonable but the papers were really enjoyable to write. Really fun, great class. Ian is great! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you have any interest in food systems and/or documentary films, you will find this class very interesting. Food is a topic that is so relevant to all of us, and it is important to understand where it is coming from and who it affects. This course changed the way I think about food - I strongly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any study interested in learning more about what we eat and how the medium of documentaries can be used to explore a topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Food and Doc. Professor Cheney is wonderful; he is a great section leader and kept the conversation going. All the classes were well organized, and the two hours just flew by. The class was roughly divided into themes, and each week covered a new one. This was a digestible way of getting through all the material.\r\n\r\nSometimes the documentaries got repetitive, but some really stood out and gave me a lot of new ideas about food access and food systems. Would super recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0I implore you to take this course. Prof. Cheney is HILARIOUS (he could have had an alternate career as a comedian). The central question of the class is \"what should I eat?\", but we go much, much further than that. Our modern food system is of grave importance, and we need as many hands on deck to solve this problem as possible. My journey has certainly started with this class. ",
            "\u00a0A must take before you leave Yale. So interesting and open paper prompts allow for creativity. "
