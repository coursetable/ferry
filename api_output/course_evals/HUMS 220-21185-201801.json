            "\u00a0I gained insight about the process of collecting and creating museums, which I had never thought much about before this class. I also learned how to approach museums with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers the history of collecting, mostly focussing on the early modern period. We covered Wunderkammern (curiosity cabinets), collections involving anatomy, apothecary workshops, and the beginnings of the modern museum. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate primary sources from the premodern era with a much more informed eye. I also learned about museum culture and collecting precedents to museums, along with several insights key epistemic shifts in European culture. ",
            "\u00a0Looking at science and medicine through a historical, and critical lens is a very important skill. This course has allowed me to see more clearly the ways in which our current realities and institutions are rooted in history. I also learned important skills in reading and analyzing primary sources. After this class I am able to critically visit a museum, and notice certain aspects of the space and the objects that I didn't use to pay attention to before. ",
            "\u00a0On a practical level, I definitely acquired a greater understanding for finding resources in Yale's libraries, especially for rare materials. I also improved upon my ability to analyze primary sources and my general knowledge of history from the early modern period. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. The readings were very well selected and the historical texts that we looked at in the medical historical library and Beinecke really informed the readings and discussion. Definitely broadened my view of museums, collections, and their purpose. ",
            "\u00a0I feel I developed as a historian and as a writer. I also learned think about museums and artifacts in new ways, and to be conscious of how objects are presented to me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the different aspects of museums that I had never considered before. We discussed the development of the early modern museum and it was so interesting to see how the museum has evolved. It gave me great insight into how I view and define the museum today and what I think about as the ideal museum structure. I helped to curate an exhibit, which was such a unique, exciting opportunity. Learning about the research and design behind museum exhibits was incredibly enlightening. I also loved the opportunity to really take advantage of all of the wonderful resources and museums that Yale has. "

            "\u00a0This course was well organized and gave rise to many fruitful discussions. I also thoroughly enjoyed all of the museum visits, which I think are an incredible part of the course. I do think the midterm assignment was a little stressful because we had very little warning about it, but Professor Bertucci and Sarah (the TF) were really helpful in assuaging my anxieties. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very fascinating. Class time was split between discussing the readings and visiting various items in the Yale collections, in the Cushing Center in the Medical History Library, the Yale Center for British Art, Beinecke Libary, and the Peabody. This was a good balance and I learned the most from these various experiences. However, I felt like there were too many readings. They were not necessarily brought up or relevant during class. Some were repetitive and others were very confusing without context. It would have helped to have a bit of guidance or context for the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that at times the discussion got a little too theoretical and normative for my liking. In a history course I prefer to have the focus on forming historical narratives rather than making judgement calls about what a museum should or shouldn't be. That being said, our historical analyses were always good about adopting the contemporary head-space and refraining from linear type arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed, and one of the things I enjoyed the most were our field trips to different places on campus. Something I would've liked would be to know what primary sources we would be looking at before the class. Also, I would've preferred talking a little bit more about the readings, but I do understand the time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great! ",
            "\u00a0This course was really fun because we got to be out of the typical classroom setting a lot but some craziness ensued with people trying to get to some of the farther away locations. I loved the opportunity to work with rare materials and artifacts. The readings were super interesting and I loved engaging with the material! This was an excellent conversation seminar and extremely stimulating. I think this class has an interesting structure for a writing credit, and I'm not sure if I liked it or not. There isn't much writing but there is a lot of very specific types of writing. It was really difficult to write labels and text posts, which I wasn't expecting. There seemed to be a little disconnect between what we were directed to write and our final outcomes. I don't know if that was because this was just such a new style of writing for all of us or because there wasn't a strict rubric. I think there should be more specific feedback earlier on in the course, and with the think pieces in particular. Each week is different but they all link together so well. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Bertucci is great, and the museum visits are really fun. Although I don't know how much I actually learned from the individual readings, the conversations we had in class showed me how to think critically about everything I read and see in a museum. ",
            "\u00a0This was a pretty fun class! We got to create our own exhibit for the midterm project, which I found to be very exciting. This was much better than writing a paper. If there is another opportunity like this, I would recommend taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to any student who is interested in the history of museums as institutions, and/or the history of collecting. It is also taught by great instructors, so if you think it might interest you, you will probably enjoy the course. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Please, please, please take this course if you can!! It completely changed my worldview and my personal life choices. I now want to go into the study of history and museums. I wish that there was a museum studies major at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in museums or collecting. The course did have a focus in medicine, but anatomical collections were a big part of early modern collecting. Really interesting course that served to broaden my perspective on collections and museums. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend this course. I found it super fascinating, but I think you have to really be fascinated by the material to get a lot out of this class. Otherwise, I think it's just fun to look at if you don't necessarily engage with the material. I also would totally recommend it because the midterm project is so unique and cool. I loved being pushed to work with Yale's collections and primary source material. "
