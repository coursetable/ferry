            "\u00a0The course does well to get the material that it teaches across. However, I think the greatest weakness of the course is the inefficiency in how it's taught, particularly in the flipped classroom. I and some of the other students tend to learn best through other ways, and certain things like the online lectures and problem sets were actually very helpful; however, I didn't feel like I was learning much in class when this material was reiterated. That being said, I definitely did learn the material so the class did convey this well, albeit not in the most efficient way. ",

            "\u00a0The course was very well run. Lecture videos, class lectures, problem sets, logistics, etc. were very clear. Only suggestion I have is adding a transcript to the video lectures- sometimes, I want to refer back to the video lecture to verify something and it can be very very tedious to find that video segment in the right video. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- TEAL classroom made collaboration very effective and fun, I liked the flipped classroom for this class as well\r\nWeaknesses- none ",
            "\u00a0Pertaining to the structure of lectures, it is as though the quantitative questions are sometimes not fully explained or left without a clear answer. Going through each question posed and then reiterating the correct answer after attempts by students would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Flip classroom may be a pain if you don't have friends taking the class with. It also sometimes feels frustrating and inefficient. Homework can sometimes take up to three hours. Strength is that Professor Faison is a great guy, knows what he's talking about and has an amazing sense of humor. ",
            "\u00a0A really tightly designed and run class. The flipped classroom worked well. Class sessions were always engaging and helpful. My table bonded! I do wish we had a chance to do some real life observation ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the subject matter, the professor, and the flipped classroom format. I appreciated having multiple ways to learn the info: the videos, the textbook, the problem sets, and the lectures themselves.\r\nThe weakness was the cross-classroom groupwork. Having us walk halfway across the room, leaving all our stuff behind, was disruptive. My original group at the table I sat at was always fairly productive, and it seemed like other groups were as well, so there wasn't really a need to mix things up. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that it was very in depth and highly engaging. A weakness is that a lot of information was covered in such little time and there was a lot of reading ",
            "\u00a0This course is interesting in that it is taught in reverse, where you learn via video lectures out of the classroom, and then do group work in the class room. It was nice getting to know people in the class and I feel like I made genuine friends. On the other hand though, I'm not sure this type of learning was conducive to me. For some reason, I really struggled to digest via the videos and ended up reading the textbook to learn the majority of things. That said, there are so many avenues to learn this information--the videos, the psets, the text book, the professor, the group work, the TAs. You are not lacking in resources in the slightest. ",
            "\u00a0Doing problems in class definitely helped me with doing the problem sets. Overall I think the class was well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I think having the discussion sections as a resource for help was very helpful and having the videos before hand as well. However, I think it would have been better if we did more practice problems that were similar to the midterm and final questions and also if the students were given access to those questions so we could review them. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the lecture videos but they were very time consuming. I wish we had spent class time more effectively. ",

            "\u00a0I think more lecture material could be covered in class ",
            "\u00a0I think that doing problems in class was very helpful and the flipped classroom worked well but I wish their had been more opportunities for concepts to be explained. The TAs did a great job of explaining things during office hours but I feel like sometimes I was confused on the application part. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs did not really know what was going on and did not provide that much help. The lectures were adequate but the professor could have done a better job of explaining the material. ",
            "\u00a0Definite strength was the flipped classroom - I loved being able to practice problems in class after watching videos for homework. Psets were really hard for the first quarter, but were more doable after the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Math was my weakness. Everything conceptual was a strength. I think for those who suffered from not knowing the content because of the Math could've done better if the professor had gone over how those concepts work in class. There are schedules office hours for anyone who needs help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\nPSETs: The PSETs are manageable in length and content. Its nothing too difficult, but it does take a lot of time to find the answers in the textbook or in the lecture videos. The majority of questions were straightforward. Overall pretty easy. \r\n\r\nParticipation: The participation component of your grade is easy to get. You get 4 absences in the semester and you just have to watch the online videos and show up to class. \r\n\r\nContent: SPACE IS INTERESTING. This is a really cool class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nExams: The questions on the midterm and final are not similar to what we do in the PSETs. The midterm and final are really short, meaning that one mistake can cost you your whole grade. You study multiple weeks worth of materials for only 4-6 questions its literally a game of luck. You may be unable to do a problem and your grade will go down DRASTICALLY. There should be more questions work less amount of points, so students grades arent based off of such a limited number of opportunities to exhibit what they learned. (This is not a gut class!!!!)\r\n\r\nFlipped Class: I did not like the flipped version of the class. Although it was nice having the lectures online to refer to, it gets extremely difficult to motivate yourself to watch 1.5 hours of lecture material before the class. Asking students to commit that much time (in addition to time doing the PSETs) outside of class is too much. \r\n\r\nGroup work: We formed groups in the beginning of the semester, and all group work was done through the groups. But, after the midterm, we were randomly placed in groups. This was REALLY uncomfortable and unnecessary. I understand that the professor was trying to spice things up but doing group work with students you dont know sucks. I found myself hesitant to ask the group questions about how the answer was found. I was also pretty confused, and there were times where the group did not communicate and none of us knew how to do the problem. Overall, it was a bad choice to switch everyone's groups after we had already become comfortable with our original groups. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom fit my learning style well, and I thought Professor Faison's emphasis on systematic thinking and conceptual learning instead of rote memorization was effective for a intro-level science course. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want some basic astronomy knowledge but aren't trying to dive super deeply into it. However, if the flipped-classroom structure is kept, you could probably learn all the material much more efficiently by reading a textbook or watching the lectures online. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a fun science class that answers many questions about the basic operations of celestial objects. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any non-STEM majors in need of a QR credit that wont completely overwhelm them. I had my doubts about how well I would do, but I found it to be very manageable. As long as you attend class and watch the videos, you can do decently well without exerting too much effort. ",

            "\u00a0Well-prepared class, great teacher! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course should be for everyone. We live on this planet/galaxy and I knew so little about it before taking this class. Initially I, as a pre-med, didn't have too much interest but I am so glad I took this course. There are weekly problem sets- straightforward and even easier if you go to the 1-hr/week TA sections for help. Professor Faison is very clear and makes a lot of effort to make the class run smoothly. TAs were very helpful and take full advantage of them in class/office hour/sections and you are set for success. There is not much stress about grades since Professor Faison set anything above 90% an A. Given that 50% of the class grade comes from pset and attendance, it is not that stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, great class if you're even remotely interested in astronomy. Learn a lot of interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! I took it for Science credit and didn't expect much. I ended up deepening friendships with old friends and making new friends over hardcore astronomy. Really enjoyable science credit. Exams are fair. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting and challenging and broadened my perspective of astronomy ",
            "\u00a0I would, only if you are looking for a SC or a QR. It is pretty manageable, and pretty interesting subject matter. I enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class for non stem majors looking for a science or qr credit or anyone who has a mild interest in astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course, especially for those who are not STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fun and not-too-challenging science credit for non-science majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Causing is amazing, and this class is so fun.  Watch lecture videos and do psets at home, and in class you do problems with people at your table, which can be really fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great intro course for non-STEM majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think Dr. Faison made the material easy to understand for people who are not otherwise interested in science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class for a science credit. The thing that stinks is you dont know what your grade will be because he grades everything on a curve at the end but the class was fun. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe--course readings and material were interesting but class organization/structure left a lot to be desired. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend for a fun and interesting science/qr class for non-science majors. Its not a total gut, you do have to have a solid grapse of the material to do well, but I appreciated that in many ways the course was more theoretical than problem-based. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this for anyone who needs a science credit. For me this class was a good step into a field that I did not know that well. The class was a lot of fun and the content was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. If you are a liberal arts major looking for a QR or science credit, this isnt going to be easy. The class is a combination of both science and math, and if both of those subjects are not your strongest fields, then you will have to put a lot of effort into to course to get an A. The PSETs are easy, participation is easy, but the midterm and final SUCK. Youre better off taking a class that's solely math or science, rather than a combination of the two. This class is a lot of work that I didnt expect. HOWEVER, its really interesting. If I wasnt constantly worried about the assignments and exams, I would definitely enjoy it more. The topics are interesting and stimulating, and the concepts are challenging. If you have an interest in science, then go for it. Its genuinely a cool class, burt its a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0I'd highly recommend this course to a student without significant science experience willing to engage with the class's content on a consistent basis and interested in gaining a thorough overview of the workings of our universe. "
