I also found my final paper very interesting to research, and learned a lot from that experience. ",

            "\u00a0Weakness: It felt the course was a little disorganized at times, partly because of time constraints. Slide show presentations at the beginning of the class providing a general overview could've helped, especially w.r.t taking notes. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class and the content. I just wish the textbook had been a bit less expensive, though I know that there isn't necessarily anything that can be done there. It was also a really good level of difficulty for having no legal background. ",
            "\u00a0As mentioned, I didn't feel like I had a strong enough law background and Marjorie often presented information very quickly and without powerpoint or visuals, so it was hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Students were allowed to speak freely on any topic. \r\nWeakness: Only a handful of students regularly participated. \r\nArea of improvement: Perhaps, having student centered discussions would increase participation. For example, on alternating class sessions, one student will lead the discussion on the course topic at hand rather than the professor. ",
            "\u00a0should be less focused specifically on cases and less time in class should be spent going over specific cases. rather, it would be useful to more broadly speak about environmental policies and how they came to be ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a very manageable reading list, with a great variety of cases. Marjorie has lots of great experiences to draw from, which always keeps classes interesting. ",
            "\u00a0There was a bit of a learning curve for me in this class, since i had not previously engaged with this type of material. Therefore, I felt a bit lost at the beginning until I got my footing. The learning environment was supportive, though, and the material built on itself in a logical way. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers were very helpful - I greatly enjoyed their visit. More of these would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed when Marjorie told us about cases she was currently on, it really helped give context to the concepts I was learning. Perhaps one or two case studies as a class provide more of this type of learning. ",
            "\u00a0There was a ton of reading, which was difficult, but that's also why the class was so effective at inducing learning. I took a class in the School of Management this semester as well, and that professor required lots of reading. However, each week a small group of students were assigned the readings for that week and tasked with leading the discussion. While every student was expected to do some reading each week and participate in the discussion, the budget of doing all the readings and providing insights was rotated among small groups of students each week. This might be a useful tool to consider implementing in this class as well. Participation grading would be a way of encouraging every student to do at least some of the reading each week, which is already part of the class, but it might be a way of more evenly distributing class participation. Just something to consider. ",
            "\u00a0The class was really enjoyable to be a part of, the professor was kind and had great candor and a very positive approach to the learning opportunity. The class could have been improved by placing more emphasis on the structure of the lectures. Some were well put together and clearly thought out, but some were hard to follow and seemingly unstructured. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was as strong as the participation on any given day. The text was expensive, but it is a new edition. With any luck the price will drop in succeeding years. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I think this course is perfect as is. I don't think it has any weaknesses nor could it be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include Marjorie's teaching style, which is open-ended while making sure that each class session communicates certain key concepts. Another: that Marjorie teaches law to non-lawyers, getting them familiar with the structure of a law class without a lot of the pretentious baggage that seems to attend such affairs. She's very down to earth and yet she knows her material really well.\r\n\r\nI think one thing that could improve the course would be offering a fact sheet or a few fact sheets on the concepts so that people had a succinct reference for some of the more technical questions that, by March, we really should have known down pat. I took careful notes but never wrote these up in a succinct way--and wish I had (or wish that someone else had, perhaps as their final project for future semesters' use).\r\n\r\nI also sometimes thought that certain students in the class spoke a lot (and at tangents to the material); Marjorie generally tolerated these interruptions, but on occasion these diversions were counterproductive to getting through the material (and not really relevant for most of us). So, figuring out a good way to both answer students' questions and move things along (to \"gently table\" students' questions) might help things. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this class is that it is based on learning very applicable and practical knowledge. The class has a great flow throughout the semester. It is also designed well to be taught to people with a law background and without one. I think it could be improved through the use of more powerpoints as we discuss cases - even just a few summary slides of the main points would be helpful just in case non lawyers missed a key point in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shansky is a very talented teacher and one of the course strengths is her real-world professional experience. One of the weaknesses was the legal jargon - was a little hard to keep up as a non-lawyer. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a solid understanding of general land use law but could be focused more specifically on environmental issues. I would've loved to learn more about climate change adaptation. ",

            "\u00a0If you're interested in land use issues, take it! No other class at FES covers this material and it's really valuable. I think this will be really useful in my work post FES. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class if you are looking for an introduction to land use law - no introduction to law is required. Great for people interested in urban and land use planning, climate adaptation, and resilience. ",

            "\u00a0Try reading some of the cases and make sure you enjoy these (or at least find value in some of them) before taking the course; virtually the entire workload is reading through the cases before each session. I also recommend working on your final project as early as possible, because Marjorie could probably provide really good feedback on these--that I don't think I really got because I waited until too late in the semester to write up my first draft. ",
            "\u00a0Great course if you are interested in land use! Do the readings every week. You will get much more out of the class if you do and very little if you don't. ",
            "\u00a0if you've previously taken land use law, it's very similar.  it helps a law student see what nonlaw students don't know about legal issues. "
