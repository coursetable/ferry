            "\u00a0I improved my german speaking, reading, and writing skills as well as my comprehension ability. ",
            "\u00a0You will improve your German language skills in terms of speaking, writing, listening and reading. A natural continuation of first semester intensive. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my proficiency in German grammar, learn relevant vocabulary, practise conversation and learn cultural details. ",
            "\u00a0Continued development of German speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0I acquired a greater facility with writing and reading, and listening and speaking in German. My ability to comprehend has increased, including my ability to figure out what someone is saying even if I do not know every word that is spoken or written. ",
            "\u00a0German speaking, reading, and writing skills. Cultural knowledge of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course has very few weaknesses, if any at all. An engaged and talented professor makes the hours fly by, and the fact that everyone in the class was committed to learning as much german as possible ensured that the classroom environment was maximally conducive to language learning. The textbook exercises might have been the only weakness of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job of building upon L1/L2 grammar while also introducing German culture. While we got a lot of practice speaking, I would've maybe liked to work on proper pronunciation more. ",
            "\u00a0Frau Sippel is the main strength of this course!!! If she is teaching, I couldn't recommend this course. She is a highly intelligent, patient and kind professor. She does a great job providing supplementary materials outside the textbook which makes class more exciting. She also does a good job providing individual feedback. The textbook exercises at times can get tedious (as can the homework) but beside that I cannot imagine a better course to improve German language skills. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, well taught. Quia is the only downfall - it's a horrible homework tool. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course is Professor Sippel and her engagement with her students. The course is also always well organized, and concepts are explained fully and clearly. I also always love when we discuss culture or history, or look at authentic German sources, whether it be a movie or article. Perhaps the only thing that I would change would be focus on the textbook exercises. Many of the exercises are simple or repetitive and while they of course provide practice, we perhaps don't get as much out of them as we do from the more interesting and challenging activities from Professor Sippel. ",
            "\u00a0I would have preferred to work with a different textbook. I enjoyed learning about the different cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but I think I would have been more excited with another textbook. \r\nIm really happy with how much learning was interactive. This was one of the best parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course, and especially Frau Sippel, was amazing. The greatest strength was Frau Sippel-- her patience, thoughtfulness, and intentionality in teaching the class. She made the class fun and engaging through the games we played and the creative activities she produced. The greater emphasis on hearing and listening, whether through movies or videos, was an important element in course.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time constraints might not allow, the only improvement I'd suggest is incorporating more review throughout the semester. The book did have some review built into its structure, but I think if we had an hour each week to review sentence structures, vocabulary, it would have enhanced our retention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There was a lot of time in class to practice speaking German (group activities, class discussion, etc.). Daily homework and weekly tests provide constant feedback. Frau Sippel cares a lot about her students. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you finish GMAN 125 then this class really is a must-take. Especially if Frau Sippel is teaching it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have any desire to reach a B1 level of German language skills, I could not recommend this course more! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to get to L4 quickly. If you want to develop proficiency it might be worth your while to take the longer cycle. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Intensive German is such a great way develop German skills in a shorter time without any sacrifice or missing out on the foundations. ",
            "\u00a0If anyone was interested in learning German I would (and have) highly recommended not only German but the intensive German section. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that are passionate about learning languages and are willing to dedicate a large chunk of time to learning German. Having a class every morning for 100 minutes can limit other academic opportunities, but it is worth it for students that are serious about learning German. "
