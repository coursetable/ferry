            "\u00a0Writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic structural niceties like MLA in-text citations, \"Who Says What,\" how to create an annotated bibliography, etc. I would also say that I got some of the best feedback in memory on my writing in this class, from my peers and from Professor Kreiner, along with measurable ways to improve that were neither overly ambiguous or overly formulaic. ",
            "\u00a0Topics covered include Rousseau's Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, feminist and gay rights movements, and the Black Lives Matter movement.  There are three papers with which students receive detailed feedback on their writing, so writing skills certainly improve over the course of the semester.  There is also a final presentation and participation in class discussions is required, so oral communication skills are developed, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I've been able to better understand the complexity of the history and contemporary state of issues in social inequality. Through class discussions and course readings, I have been exposed to topics which I had not learned much about. In addition, I feel as though I am a much better writer after taking this course. I am better able to compile relevant sources, write more clearly and effectively, and become more engaged in social inequality issues. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to get much more comfortable with MLA format than I was previously, and I was also able to learn a lot about the topic of the course! This course was my first seminar-style course and I found the environment to be really enjoyable and the professor to be professional but supportive and humane. ",
            "\u00a0Through the readings, class discussions, and research, I learned about a variety of historical ideas and movements focused on social equality and analyzed how they relate to current issues. Through the writing assignments, I improved my ability to organize pieces of evidence, clarify logical arguments, and connect my analysis to a theoretical framework. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about current events and underlying themes in society on an academic level that I would not have otherwise. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating material\r\nWeakness: my section was quiet which made it boring ",
            "\u00a0One strength was the workshop-style classes, as well as the wide range of topics covered in the readings, and the intermediate partial-draft deadlines for each paper. (please keep the partial-draft deadline structure, it was so helpful for workload management and getting feedback early). The structure of the P3 assignment was well set-up to allow you to write about virtually anything that interested you, and the P4 was fun and stress-free as promised. I think the class could be improved through more debate and dialogue about current issues within class, as opposed to less of Professor Kreiner explaining the readings, although for texts like Rousseau, that was also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0very interesting readings, engaging discussion facilitated by the instructor, many opportunities to meet with the instructor to discuss papers and more, extensive feedback given on essay drafts and final copies ",
            "\u00a0The course is not too demanding but also not too lenient- the topic of interest was really captivating as well. I do wish that there had been more of a clear \"conclusion\" to the central discussion behind the course - we never really did get the final word on \"the trouble with equality\" and I think that may have been very nice to have. ",
            "\u00a0The English 114 approach to writing assignments is difficult, but it works: it provides many opportunities for feedback, lots of time for revision, and chances to improve for each essay. I found discussions with Prof. Kreiner during office hours particularly useful. The selection of readings for this section provided useful examples of different perspectives and issues related to inequality. Class discussion was useful and frequently brought up new ideas, but I wish the class could have facilitated wider participation, particularly toward the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that there is not enough introduction or guidance into doing the academic essay and how to distinguish different types of analysis. There could be more workshops. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class as a good intro, first-year writing course about an interesting topic that will measurably improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend it.  The topics covered are very interesting and lead to engaging class discussions.  The essay prompts are also captivating and leave room for creativity on the part of the student. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to be a better writer and learn about issues regarding social inequality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Kreiner is wonderful and gives really great feedback. The topic and readings are really interesting and allow for a wide range of discussion so students with a variety of interests are able to contribute to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The high expectations for writing assignments are definitely a challenge, but they're manageable with the guidance of Prof. Kreiner, and the topic is very interesting. I was initially scared by the stories of overly heavy workloads and erratic assessment that I'd heard about English 114, but none of them really turned out to be true. Prof. Kreiner provides detailed and actionable comments on drafts, and he is frequently available for extra help at office hours. While the readings don't provide any kind of full history of approaches to inequality, they provide provocative examples of ideas and events that are central to our discussion of equality today. Class discussions were sometimes slow, but almost always pointed out an idea I hadn't considered before. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. Professor Kreiner is incredibly insightful and engaging with his students. He approaches current events in a non partial yet informative way. "
