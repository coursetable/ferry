            "\u00a0I learned about different experiments in the novel, both in 18th century literature and modern literature. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to ask questions about the novelistic form and to question what exactly makes a work a \"novel,\" as opposed to any other form of literature. I learned how novelists are pushing the boundaries of the form and how they have been challenging it since the 18th-century, and I also gained an appreciation for these older works and how they can influence the new. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything else, I gained a greater appreciation for the continued relevance of old literature. The unique structure of this course - pairing old and contemporary literature - made me think about the books we read in a very different way, and it made me much more conscious of the evolution of literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to reading and thinking about 18th century fiction. We learned about the conventions and concerns typically present in the fiction of the time, and the way that experiments in narrative form allow those novels to deviate from those conventions. I also developed insight into the way contemporary fiction draws on the same subversion of convention. Broadly, the most important question we continued to raise - and perhaps never answered - was exactly what \"is\" a novel. We also considered what the value of fiction is, what a novel \"does\" and why we read them. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot more about the history of the novel as a form and the 18th-century novel as a genre. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed reading works that were both contemporary and from the 18th/19th centuries to compare them and to see where there was thematic overlap. I developed skills to analyze connections between the readings and to formulate comments in discussion about the style and format of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0This class was my first exposure to 18th-century novels, and I enjoyed the opportunity to read four key works from this critical period in the development of English prose fiction. I also developed an ability to compare experimental novels from two very different cultural contexts, with attention to political and social issues, print (and digital) culture, and even medical technologies. Thanks to our short in-class presentations, I learned about a host of topics from punk rock to PowerPoint. And, as an upper-level English seminar should, this course helped me refine my writing skills -- particularly through Professor Campbell's detailed comments and helpful office-hours advice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the form of the novel has changed overtime, and I got better at thinking about novels and their structure critically. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Campbell is so kind and amazing! She is so willing to meet with her students and very willing to give feedback. She also provides \"creative writing\" options for both papers, which is amazing for aspiring fiction writers! Also, there are only two official papers the whole semester, which is great (as long as you take them both seriously). We also have to drop our papers off physically in the LC dropbox, which I found kinda fun\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't so much a weakness, but just be aware that some weeks you will be doing A LOT of reading. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were always wonderful and well-guided, and the syllabus was great overall, with the exception perhaps of Tristram Shandy (which I enjoyed but felt that it was a bit time-consuming). I really loved going to the Beinecke and the Yale Center for British Art. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list, while excellent, was perhaps a tad over-ambitious. I might suggest removing a book. Also, while Professor Campbell was always insightful in classes, I wish that she had spoken slightly less frequently; at times, the class felt closer to a lecture than a seminar. I have no other complaints. The readings, primary and secondary, were all excellent. Professor Campbell also gave me incredibly comprehensive feedback on my pieces. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were a well-balanced syllabus, a professor who was prepared with important critical discussion points that made use of both close-reading and thematic synthesis, and fruitful discussion. The reading load, while rigorous, was not overwhelming. I appreciated that we made use of the resources we have here at Yale by having excursions to the Beinecke and the YCBA. Another strength was the emphasized placed on our own individual choice and interests; every student got to do a bit of research and present a topic of their interest, we could opt to do some creative writing in our papers, and we conducted \"book-club\" style discussions on books of our choice at the end of the course. I also found the class to be fairly well-balanced between group work and larger seminar-style discussion - although we had around 18 students, so for a larger seminar, perhaps more small group work would have been in order. The only other improvement I could suggest would be to write three papers instead of two, to give us more of an opportunity to progress in thinking about these 18th century texts. For someone like me who did the critical option first and the creative option for the final, I didn't really get a chance to incorporate Prof Campbell's feedback - plus having more assignments in the course helps ease grade-related worries. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course overall -- Professor Campbell was great, and the mix of contemporary and 18th-century texts was well balanced and ultimately really interesting. I really appreciated the creative options for papers. Discussion was lively and thoughtful, with lots of really interesting questions asked about genre and craft (unsurprisingly) as well as various themes and social issues. I wish we had read a broader selection of \"experiments\" in the novel -- most of the contemporary texts (while all good!) shared a similar structure, with multiple rotating main characters. I wish we'd read things that experimented more with language as well as form since that felt slightly repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Two things. First, I could see a version of this class that interwove novels and literary theory: how did people talk about novels in the 18th century? What do literary critics think now? Why was the \"rise of the novel\" theory disproven? Second, I love reading responses because they are the first stab at articulating abstract ideas about the readings. They don't take long, and I would have loved the chance to practice my writing more in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Campbell is an amazing professor who gives a lot of attention to her students. At times, some students in the class spoke much more than others, so maybe trying to allow the quieter students to speak more often would be valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I especially enjoyed that we read a mixture of 18th-century and contemporary novels. Class discussions were always interesting, informative, and focused. The reading was a bit too much, in that I think the amount we had to read was sometimes unrealistic and pretty much no one completed it in full. That being said, I found what I did read (which was most of the assigned material) to be beautiful and fascinating. I also appreciated that Professor Campbell offered creative options for our essays because creative writing is often overlooked in academic classes as unserious. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Campbell is a great strength of this course (and, I imagine, of any course that she teaches). Her deep interests in both eighteenth-century and contemporary fiction set us up for excellent discussions. The opportunity to visit the Beinecke (twice!) and YCBA augmented my experience of experimental and (for me) unfamiliar eighteenth-century texts.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that a future version of this course might focus more on eighteenth-century novels. It seemed that the class as a whole was less excited to discuss Pamela and Tristram Shandy -- our two longest eighteenth-century texts -- than the comparatively reader-friendly contemporary novels. I wonder whether a greater emphasis on eighteenth-century texts (perhaps a 2/3 to 1/3 split, for instance?) might have helped our group of readers feel more commitment to and enthusiasm for the older selections on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I loved, loved, loved class discussion and the creative option for essays! That's the best way for me to engage with texts, and I really enjoyed it. I also liked the reading list; however, Pamela and Tristram Shandy were not very compelling for me. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you are looking to satisfy the 18th/19th Century requirement, and even if you aren't, I would definitely recommend this class. You get to read a lot of awesome 18th century (and especially modern 21st century works). I would also highly recommend this class if you enjoy writing fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I read wonderful books, wrote really interesting essays, and had a wonderful professor who allowed us to pursue our own interests and develop our own lines of thinking and connections to the texts. The presentations were a really great way to see how the texts we read are relevant to the outside world, and it inspired me to learn about the contexts in which books are situated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A lot of reading, but Jill is incredibly committed to her students, and the seminars were almost all great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Professor Campbell is great at pulling out the interesting discussion points from really dense 18th century texts, and also balances out the syllabus with contemporary works that provide both a fun break and a fresh way to think about the novelistic experiments. I left every class meeting feeling like the discussion had been focused, productive, respectful, and natural. Perhaps that's a testament to both a wonderful cohort of classmates and a wonderful professor, but the class structure and the way the syllabus progressed also made for discussions that built on one another. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course if you're genuinely interested in the material and/or if you need an 18th century requirement. The course is great, but it's a LOT of reading very old and difficult texts. Like, Tristram Shandy is a slog. Pamela is a slog. Make sure you really, really consider whether you want to read a 600 page shaggy dog story before you take the course. But if you're an English major who usually prefers contemporary literature or creative writing, this class is a great option for filling the 18th century requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class if you love reading fiction. Take this class if you want to work with one of the best professors at this university. Take this class if you are an aspiring writer, English major, or STEM person--anyone is welcome. Or, alternatively, if you want a book club for credit, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a challenging course in that you will read a lot each week consistently. You also will be expected to compose an informational report in addition to the readings for one week of class. This is all enjoyable work, but it is a considerable amount of work and not an easy course. We read great novels in the class--I especially enjoyed A Visit From the Goon Squad. It's really interesting comparatively to see how works across time period can relate. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great course that focuses more on the novel form in general than just on the 18th-century novel, though of course that period was critical for the genre's genesis. It was great to discover that many of the experiments being performed in contemporary literature were already happening in the 18th century; it introduces a much needed historical perspective to literary analysis. Professor Campbell is awesome and dedicated and any course she teaches is worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in a challenging and unexpected English seminar. If, like me, you have little to no experience reading eighteenth-century novels, you may be as surprised as I was to discover their constant experimentation and their resonances with today's cutting-edge fiction. If you have only minimal interest in eighteenth-century novels, know that they are interesting but also quite long and often challenging in a variety of ways. But know, too, that Professor Campbell is an excellent teacher! If you come to this course at least curious about eighteenth-century fiction, then you will surely enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It's a very experimental course, as per the name, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone without experience in more traditional English courses, but for English majors or people with a strong interest, it's a no brainer. "
