            "\u00a0I improved all aspects of my Spanish knowledge-- writing, speaking, listening. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a ton of grammar. I also became a lot more comfortable reading and understanding long and more difficult texts in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to speak and read Spanish definitely improved. It was very helpful to have the review of my first two semesters of Spanish and apply that knowledge to the books we read and movies we watched. It was nice to have daily practice speaking and reading Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Spanish grammar and vocabulary. There was some engagement with Spanish culture. ",
            "\u00a0OMG! I'm not exaggerating by saying that my Spanish improved exponentially by taking this course. ",

            "\u00a0Very good course-- has the perfect amount of homework and all of it is helpful and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Reymundi was definitely an asset for the course. It could have been improved by including more relevant/realistic to read texts for the lecturas. Also the quizzes were an unreasonably hard compared to the other assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was heavily focused on grammar. I certainly learned a lot of grammar, but I wish it wasn't quite so rooted in the textbook. I liked the end of the course a lot, in which we read a book and watched a movie. I felt like my ability to read texts definitely improved. ",
            "\u00a0This class is just a ton of mundane work. The major strength was the instruction from Professor Reymundi, but be prepared for constant assignments, many of which feel minimally helpful. I will be an anti-Supersite evangelical until the day I die. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: speaking in Spanish every day, grammar lessons, reading and writing in Spanish\r\nWeaknesses: too few opportunities to practice speaking and listening in Spanish ",
            "\u00a0The professor was absolutely amazing! She was a major strength of the course. I think one of the weaknesses of the course is that some of the readings were extensively long. But other than that, the overall course was great. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could spend a little more time on the bigger sources we've read but other than that everything else is strong ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: variety of assignments, covers a lot of material, very few peaks in work\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes speeds through lessons and material, requires constant attention and work, homework was not always helpful ",

            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you want to improve your grammar and your ability to read long texts in Spanish. It was certainly a bit tedious at times, but I definitely improved overall. I'd recommend taking it over L1 of a new language if you placed into L3 Spanish. If you do the work and study for the tests, you should get a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think I still would despite my reservations. My Spanish has certainly improved, and because this is the only way Yale offers to get better at Spanish at this level, if you're looking to learn the language I'd take this course. ",

            "\u00a0If you are trying to fulfill a language requirement, then take this course. The course is very dependent on the professor, though. I really liked my professor so class was often engaging and interesting. ",

            "\u00a0yes for span 3 but it was a lot of work and would not recommend if they didn't have time to put in more work than they would expect. "
