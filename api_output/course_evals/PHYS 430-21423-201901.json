            "\u00a0This class helped me solidify my knowledge of vector calc, not to mention I finally learned about Maxwell's equations, waves, radiation, B and E fields in materials, and covariant E&M! ",
            "\u00a0This class is a sprint through Griffith's Electrodynamics textbook. This class covers electrostatics and magnetostatics in detail before diving into Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics. Some time is devoted to optics and radiation with any time leftover going towards the potential formulation of electrodynamics and electrodynamics and special relativity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of electromagnetism, basically straight out of Griffiths. ",
            "\u00a0E&M - all chapters of Griffiths EM ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you the modern theory of electromagnetism, including Maxwell's equations in matter and in vacuum, EM waves and optics, with some relativistic (covariant-formulation) electrodynamics.  The course gives you a working knowledge of EM theory, and covers several examples, drawn from various physical situations. ",
            "\u00a0The same E&M as in intro physics but with more math (multipole expansion, differential equations, tensors) ",
            "\u00a0I developed tons of knowledge about electrodynamics. I especially liked the part about maxwell equations and its application to optics. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught the theory of electromagnetism but I felt that my overall physical intuition developed by taking this course. A lot was spent trying to formulate the theory around co-ordinate frames, training me mentally in finding the best way to solve an equation or express a vector. E&M provided the training and technical skills needed to solve spatially-dependent problems. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you everything you need to know about electromagnetism to graduate with a bachelors degree in physics, no more, no less. It covers everything in Griffiths, although we had to cram all of special relativity into one lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned far more new material than I thought I would, and now feel like I thoroughly understand the E&M concepts I had already been exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0Classical Electrodynamics ",
            "\u00a0This class is an overview of electromagnetic theory. We learned how to solve for the electric and magnetic fields of various arrangements of charges and currents using Maxwell's equations and other useful formulas. We also studied electromagnetic radiation and briefly discussed electromagnetism from the perspective of special relativity. ",
            "\u00a0You get through basically all of fundemental electrostatics and magnetostatics. Then you get an intermediate to advanced level of electrodynamics, an intermediate level of discussions of E&M waves and radiation, and a taste of time dependent fields and potentials and relativistic E&M.

            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Prof. Moore is a legend. He's very nice and super receptive to student feedback. He actually listened to our mid-semester feedback about the psets being too long and shortened them. No other professor would do this. Very willing to meet you in office hours and talk, which is huge. I feel like this class really helps you get a solid grasp of a subject you've been getting in bits and pieces since high school.\r\n\r\nIf I were forced to come up with a weakness, I'd say perhaps Prof. Moore could give more examples in class that aren't from Griffiths. Nothing wrong with his teaching, I like that if I don't understand something in class, I can go back to the book and study it more carefully. Like I said, pretty much no weaknesses. This is Prof. Moore's first class, and he's only going to get better, so if you're reading this in the future, take it with him! ",
            "\u00a0This course did feel a bit fast paced at times -- especially towards the end where we had more advanced topics being covered very quickly. I feel like adjusting it so that the pace is more uniform throughout the course of the semester may be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this class (besides the excellent teaching) is the use of the best textbook for learning E+M. Griffith's is the industry standard -- and for good reason. Griffith's explanations are clear and concise (and sometimes humorous); his textbook problems are also fantastic. The drawback to this class is the pacing. Its goal is to get through every single chapter of Griffiths, a mammoth task -- especially when half of the semester is spent on electro-and magneto-statics (topics that are usually covered pretty well in depth in intro classes like 181 and 260). This leaves only half of the semester to cover the more conceptually challenging concepts like special relativity and the potential formulation. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were good, but some of the problem sets in the first half were long and overly algebraic. Test questions could also be more clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well taught, open book exams allowed us to understand instead of memorize, I liked when the prof wrote his own questions\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of content to go through ",
            "\u00a0The course covers the subject in-depth and comprehensively.  Lectures were engaging and helpful. The course was excellently taught, followed a standard curriculum, and the assignment-and-assessment structure was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0clear textbook ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is that we cover the second half of the materials too fast and the first half too slow. The strengths are responsible instructor, interesting problem sets and reasonable grading policy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great instructor with good notes. Everything flowed in an understandable manner. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Moore did an incredible job, however it would have been nice to stray away from Griffiths (the textbook). Most of the in class examples were just from the book, and although explained well, were not always the most illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0There is a tie between Professor Moore and the Griffiths textbook as to which one is the strongest part of this class, as both are great at facilitating student learning. The lectures are clear and follow the textbook to a T. I'd say the biggest weakness might actually be that there is no extra information beyond Griffiths, which is made as a normalized textbook for all undergraduates. I think we could handle more interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are phenomenal and filled with examples and full derivations, which I find helpful. I don't know how I feel about the open-note exams: they certainly feel like what we would be faced with in the \"real world\", but in studying for exams I focused more on writing down equations than on larger concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course's greatest strength was in how well organized it was. The textbook (Griffiths) is very good and the class followed the textbook very closely. The homeworks were generally of reasonable length, and solutions were provided online after the due date. Lecture notes for every single lecture were posted online as well. The midterm with solutions was posted online after we had all taken it. And, there were review sessions and extra office hours to help us prepare for every single assessment. ",
            "\u00a0We adhered to Griffith's E&M for essentially the entirety of this class, which was in some ways a strength and in others a weakness. It was easy to review material and the class was well structured, but we also did not study much outside the scope of the book. It may have been nice to learn a few more interesting things that were not found in the book. "

            "\u00a0Yeah definitely. Coming into this class, I was very scared it was going to be killer work, but I felt it was a comfortable challenge and I'm so happy I finally understand E&M! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0If Professor Moore is teaching this class, take it in a heartbeat. Professor Moore is an engaging lecturer and cares deeply about his student's experience in his class. His psets are not time-consuming at all. In fact, when he solicited feedback and learned that the problem sets were taking a little too long, he actually cut down the length of the assignments to make them more reasonable. He rocks! The only drawback is that his exams were a little on the long side, but they had a generous curve since most people did not even finish them. Also, a free piece of advice if you're reading this review: basically all of his exam questions are taken from Griffiths, so if you do enough of Griffith's practice problems you might do a problem that comes up on the test. If Professor Moore is not teaching it, then I'm assuming you're taking this class for the major; in that case, you're just going to have to buckle down and trudge through Griffiths -- it's a rite of passage. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre a physics major, its requires, but Professor Moore is probably the best Professor to take it with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a must for physics majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. For anyone interested in physics, this is an essentially important and helpful course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course if it is taught by Professor Moore. He is highly passionate about answering questions from students and enthusiastic about introducing us to the world of electromagnetism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is needed for mental development of the physics discipline. It provides a very sound foundation of electromagnetic theory and prepares one for additional physics courses. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to major in the physical sciences, take this class. It's really your choice between this one and PHYS 402, so it'll come down to who is teaching each course. If Prof. Moore is teaching 430, take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for physics majors and any other engineering major because you do gain a much greater understanding of these topics. If you're not going to be using these topics in depth, though, and you've already had E&M in a course, you probably don't need this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the subject matter take the class ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to know more about electromagnetism. It is an important subject which every physicist ought to know well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely to anyone interested in physics! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Especially if Professor Moore is teaching it. I know everyone hates E&M but the class is actually really fun, and gets you to see it in a new light. I think what generally makes E&M annoying is how hand wavey everything usually is. While there still is a certain measure of that, you mostly go through everything quite rigorously and end up understanding a lot. "
