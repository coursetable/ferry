            "\u00a0I learned about how chemistry pertains to global trends as a whole and learned about the science behind reactions I use in my daily life ranging from testing pool chemicals at the facility I work at or the chemical reactions I use to heat up food during military training. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a fundamental understanding of chemical change at the molecular level. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me all the skills needed to master in general chemistry with a fast pace. It allowed me to develop a fast way of tackling all kinds of analytical chemistry problems. ",
            "\u00a0Not many. Was mostly reviewing my high school chem. ",
            "\u00a0Significant figures, solving for asked quantities in a single mathematical expression using multiple scientific concepts and formulas, the chemical/physical properties of matter that affect their characteristics (especially those of solutions, then gases). those three I believe were the highlights of this course for me. ",
            "\u00a0I had taken Chemistry in highschool and in my first year of college. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are the rate at which we are able to finish the course. It is nice to finish in just 5 weeks, however that's also the greatest downfall. The pace is killer at times and provides a great deal of stress. It might be nice if the syllabus was accurate as well. The meeting times in reality were not reflected by the syllabus and that can be troublesome, especially as a commuter. ",
            "\u00a0The course effectively covers all the material, but it is very dry. Nothing is done during the lectures (save the occasional rhetorical question) in order to engage the class. The material is interesting, but having the same format of lecture every day for 5 weeks becomes uninteresting after a certain point. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Solid lectures, helpful TA. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the way its organized and the discussion sections. The weaknesses I would say that the instructor sometimes goes way beyond the scope of the class (both in material and time). ",
            "\u00a0The course is really cramped up together in a short time and with a really bad professor who keeps drifting off topic. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: not enough lecture time to go in depth. It's neither a beginner's course nor is it an intermediate course. To elaborate, it would be unrealistic to expect a student with no high school background to succeed nor does a person who has the high school background to learn much compared to the time they put in class. I could've learned much more (having high school background). Those who don't would've faced problems at the beginning when everything was covered but so shallowly and fast. \r\nStrength: i liked how the assigned homework cover future material, so we come to the class prepared to focus on what we found problematic and also because we can contribute to the class more that way. Prof. Cramer is amazing and willing to answer all questions. He gives chemistry insight from real life that directly relates to the lessons so effortlessly (an example would be when he came to class on a foggy day and then explained the restriction of temperature and pressure for fog to exist and linked it to solutions). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that the professor would always be willing to have office hours ready for students to come by. The weaknesses were that the the tested concepts were often quite difficult and the professor would often go off tangent during lecture. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they are serious about finishing intro chemistry or need it. It is not a leisurely course and requires motivation to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for a general introduction to the subject. It is a good method through which to determine if you are interested in Chemistry, but if that interest is already set, than the course is a bit non-engaging for that category of student. ",
            "\u00a0Indeed, especially if he or she is interested in learning about chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would tell them that its a very challenging course. ",
            "\u00a0The same course maybe but only if its with a different instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the level of the student. I would recommend it for people who want to finish credits, but for those who are taking the course just to learn, I would rather recommend a more in-depth course with more challenging questions and concepts. "
