            "\u00a0Gave me perspectives on a field of study that I never would have been exposed to otherwise! It was good at helping inform me of the construction of gender history  how we can look at texts as a way of reconstructing what a woman's life could have been like. ",
            "\u00a0We learned so much about Ancient Egyptian society and how women lived during that time. I really enjoyed reading the ancient papyrus letters--how cool that Yale's Beinecke Library has some of the papyri! ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills and insight into ancient society ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of looking closely at the point from which documents are written and the impact this cabn have. I also realized how malleable yet resilient a society can be under outside influence. Most importantly, I learned how our ideas of people and women of a society are shaped by what we know, but looking at materials of the time can help one to discover an intricacy and universality to a society.

            "\u00a0Professor Manning made this class extremely accessible which was incredible. He also did a good job of making the discussion inclusive for anybody who wanted to contribute. I think that one of the weaknesses was that it felt that Professor Manning made it so inclusive that some never felt the need to speak, which was frustrating at times for those that consistently did the readings and wanted to engage in more of a debate with those from other disciplines. Overall Professor Manning is truly passionate about the work that he was doing, and he did a really good job of allowing the students to take control of the conversation and talk about what they wanted to talk about. Overall, this felt like what a seminar should be at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-organized and covers the important aspects of society one could hope to learn about from the time. The readings are understandable and well-explained by Professor Manning and his knowledge always proves helpful to expanding the depths of the readings. It could be improved by having a bit of a crash course in the beginning as a general introduction to the time and society. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Manning is an expert in the field of Egyptology, and he is passionate about what he's teaching. DO THE READINGS or else it really won't be interesting. This should go without saying, but if you do the readings, you can really help steer the conversation since Prof. Manning allows the class to decide what interests them which is a total blessing. This is TOTALLY a class for folks who have no exposure to the subject matter but are willing to learn! Prof. Manning makes this a very inclusive space. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend it. It's a fascinating subject and Prof. Manning is a really great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not unless the class becomes more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Prof manning is so fun to learn from because he is so engaged in the material. The freedom he allows in the essay topics made the class and the work super enjoyable because you could basically take it any way you wanted. Not a lot of other classes like it at yale. I liked the round table discussion. Manning is so informed on the topic, you can pretty much ask him anything and he will be able to answer it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a very interesting course ",
            "\u00a0Course was interesting and chill ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was very insightful and I learnt a lot in a relatively lower stress environment ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The papers are short and prompts are quite open. The readings are light and interesting. The material is relatable to the present in a surprising manner. Also, Professor Manning knows a lot about the material and has his own interesing input that adds to the course. "
