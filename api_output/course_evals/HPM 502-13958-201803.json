            "\u00a0The course was poorly structured and did not help me learn the material at all. The only way I learned was through homework assignments, which were also poorly structured because we had to do them in advance of the homework material actually being taught in class. So if there was no Investopedia and Google in general, not sure how I'd ever get through this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized very well in the sequence. The textbook is helpful, and the daily homework is essential to mastering the material. WIth that said, the lectures were not very helpful. PowerPoints didn't add any value to the course ",
