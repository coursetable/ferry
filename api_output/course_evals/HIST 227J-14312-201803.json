            "\u00a0This course revolutionized how I thought about the Crusades. Admittedly, I knew very little about the Crusades, for a history major. The objective of this course is to instill a comprehensive understanding of the Crusades, using recent scholarship. The result is a much more sympathetic view of the Crusaders. Unfortunately, they are generally depicted as greedy conquerors or backwards zealots, but such characterizations are misguided. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this course! ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent overview of the crusading period, and helped me to understand the myriad social, religious, and military factors that contributed to the campaigns and their aftermath.  I found it to be a very strong course and enjoyed the focus on class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Entering the class as someone with relatively little background in medieval history I certainly felt as if I gained a greater understanding of not only the crusades, but the political and religious contexts they were situated in. Additionally I felt my writing skills were greatly improved throughout the course of the class, especially my ability to conduct in-depth research on a single issue for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the Crusades, their place in history, causes, and effects, both then and in our historical consciousness ",
            "\u00a0history and especially historiography of the Crusades. "

            "\u00a0Classroom discussion was robust. This might be the first seminar where I felt that everyone was actually doing all the readings. Every student participated in discussion. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I could not do all of the readings most weeks, and I believe cutting one reading from the middle weeks would be preferable. \r\n\r\nWere the short essays in the beginning useful? Probably not, but they weren't the end of the world. I would have preferred an assignment related to our final paper that was due before the midterm. Maybe a primary source analysis? Maybe the historiography? Anyhow, I would have preferred something relevant to the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were an excellent instructor, very well-chosen readings, a thoughtful course structure, and engaging discussion. I thought the 500-word essays were an effective way to prepare us for the final paper. The only suggestion I have is to supplement the short papers with a slightly longer one (maybe 2 to 3 pages) to help us practice developing arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was a little ridiculous that there was not a basic narrative of the crusades assigned for the course as reading.  The Tyerman very short introduction was nice but optional, and we never went over the basic timeline and events of the crusades in class (except for the first crusade, which was great).  I think it would be nice if there were required readings from a more robust introduction to the crusades that we went over briefly, for example, at the beginning of class.  Though many students came in with a solid nuts and bolts knowledge of the crusades going in, some like me had very little experience with them, and the class was not designed to give you that knowledge.  I think the above would be a nice equalizer for the class so that everyone is at least on the same page.  Other than that, great primary sources and great discussions in the course!  Very fruitful dialogue and disagreement between both students and professor. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class was definitely the dynamic which built over the semester between the students and instructor, I felt this helped to guide our discussions, especially when unpacking the readings, and made for a generally productive learning environment. One area for improvement I would highlight would be the reading selection at some points. While overall excellent, it felt at times as if the readings focused on more specialist issues such as craftsmanship or church architecture to the exclusion of more general histories of the crusades or accounts of what the crusader kingdoms really looked like as a whole. To someone without an extensive background, this led to some confusion for me but on the whole it was not significant enough to hamper my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. It was super interesting, the professor knew a lot about the topic, and the students showed up to class prepared and interested ",
            "\u00a0Maybe slightly more chronology just to help put some more events in context. "

            "\u00a0This is from the perspective of a Senior History major who likes taking seminars.\r\n\r\nAt times, it is intimidating how much background knowledge most of my fellow classmates had in the subject. I knew very little about this era of history, so I feel like I learned a lot. Nevertheless, I do not believe this disparity affected the grading whatsoever. \r\n\r\nLord is a good professor, fair grader, and kind person.\r\n\r\nClassroom discussions were robust, as it seems that everyone did at least most of the readings. This is NOT a class where you can get away with not doing at least some reading.\r\n\r\nThe workload was average for a history seminar- nothing exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe class is formatted in a way that each week is a different deep dive into an aspect of the Crusades. Consequently, you learn the basic facts as you go. Most Yale history seminars are like this.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm happy I took the class because:\r\n1. the classroom discussion was good\r\n2. I learned a lot about a new type of history for me\r\n3. the workload/grading was fair ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. I took it as a nonjunior, nonmajor, but I still found the course rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Great primary sources and topics, although the course is not designed to give you nuts and bolts knowledge of what actually happened on the crusades.  That will require some extra work on the student's part by doing optional readings and other introductory readings about the crusades. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is not only interesting and edifying, it changes your worldview about the Crusades and presents many useful perspectives on the Crusaders, their beliefs and stories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the crusades at all. "
