            "\u00a0I learned about women's health, birth, conception, menstruation, menopause, sexual arousal, menstrual taboos, and everything in between. This class taught me things about my own body as a female-bodied individual that I most definitely should have known, but didn't because of how little we talk about these things. I ADORED this class and recommend it to all genders. ",
            "\u00a0A very strong overview of the biology of reproduction along with the ability to consider the social implications of reproduction on women. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about my own body! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about important topics in women's health like pregnancy, menstruation, breastfeeding, etc. I learnt to develop critical thinking stills and to question statistics and come up with hypotheses. ",
            "\u00a0You definitely learn many things about womens reproductive lives! As advertised. some really surprising things about ones own body, some unsurprising things about how patriarchy shapes the way we do science and the way reproductive medicine works. The class is totally decent but I dont understand why it has the hype that it has take it if youre interested, but dont be sad if you dont get in! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the intersection between biology and society, and how the ecological worlds we occupy impact and shape women's experiences of reproduction ",
            "\u00a0Class was really insightful into the evolution and biology of womens reproduction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about my own body, about anthropology, and about an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to a hotly debated issue. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about both the biology and the culture aspect's of women's reproductive health. The course material included biology, anthropology, WGSS, and other disciplines; we both read scientific journal articles and engaged with documentaries/journalistic coverage. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more than I could have possibly imagined about women's bodies, their reproductive lives, and their evolutionary history. From sexual response to birth control to birth, I know have an actual understanding of women's reproductive lives and why things work they way they do. ",
            "\u00a0I really gained a lot of knowledge on women's reproductive biology, especially around common myths regarding the topic. Additionally, I appreciated the scientifically-critical as well as cross-cultural approach the course took on the subject and feel that I came out of the class with a much more nuanced view of related contemporary issues around the world. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me essential knowledge about female body wellness and reproductive health across cultures and societies. ",
            "\u00a0Women's reproduction, from birth to post menopausal. A focus on evolutionary theories that might explain menopause, birth, etc + a surprising amount of pure bio facts. Comparison across traditional/industrialized societies. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL CLASS, you question everything you think you know about being a girl, but more importantly, you question everything you think you know about being human. surprisingly, you do this through the lens of science instead of philosophy and there's something amazing about the intersection of objectivity and human vulnerability. DO IT ",
            "\u00a0Learned to apply evolutionary thinking to human biology and integrate these lines of thinking with a biocultural approach to thinking about societies. This was my first time studying humans in any scientific way, so that was a little bit of an adjustment, but it was very rewarding. "

            "\u00a0great focus on pedagogy (limited enrollment, while unfortunate, is intentional and improves the class experience) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Claudia Valeggia is an angel and very helpful professor, the journal assignment allows you to grow and track your growth, lectures were comprehensible, Prof Valeggia knew when we were having a bad day and would tailor class to our level of engagement, 5 minute meditations at the start f every class, seminar discussions about topics students were interested in... god I could go on forever about this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: absolutely nothing ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is in the community it builds. This is a class where you will truly learn from the other students, the TF, and the professor. It's also Valeggia's favorite class to teach, so she's always on the ball.\r\n\r\nThe ways that the course could be improved vary from year to year because of how much it adapts to the students, who are enrolled. But Professor Valeggia asks consistently for feedback and is super responsive, so I doubt there will ever be any major failings in the structure of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that Claudia is an amazing and incredibly sweet professor who has great command over the subject and who has undertaken various research and teaches from experience. The class is capped at 30 people and so that mostly everyone in the class knows each other and Claudia makes it a point to get to know you personally as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the truly incredible class discussions, an engaging and brilliant professor in Dr. Valeggia, and the importance (and novelty) of the subject matter. Weaknesses would be the long and scientific readings (as a non-STEM major, not something I'm super used to!) which sometimes would never come up in class. Assignments all seemed reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0I think all the assignment were very fair. I wish there was more time for class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Claudia, the small class size. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the body, and I enjoyed learning the biology of different functions and explanations for various phenomena. The course ended up having a lot of material, so studying for the exams was difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a single improvement to this class. Professor Valeggia teaches this class like clock work - her material is organized and engaging, the assignments are challenging but not at all overwhelming, and there is the perfect amount of reading. She lets her students guide her lectures, and more than once she spent entire classes answering people's random questions or hosting discussions about topics that were on our minds. The only weakness is that not everyone at Yale can take this course. ",
            "\u00a0There were really no weaknesses to the course in my opinion. It was highly engaging, covered both a breadth and depth of issues and was overall really geared towards student learning and an enjoyable student experience. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Valeggia is outstanding and made every class an adventure. She was so willing to let each lecture become whatever we as the students wanted to make of it; we engaged with the material in new and interesting ways every class and she answered all of our questions thoughtfully and candidly. No weaknesses I can find. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really interesting course material that is very relevant, a lot of room to learn things every! one! should know about women's reproduction but don't. Claudia tries to be inclusive, and everyone is clearly engaged and curious.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was honestly kind of confused about the expectations of the course, esp when it came to the critical reviews (although the feedback for the 1st CR was very clear on wha I needed to do to improve). We often drift away from the lecture topic, which I think it a strength for some, but tbh just left me less engaged and unclear about what the focus of the lecture is. ",
            "\u00a0there were moments when we weren't quite sure what exactly we were supposed to know for the course i.e. in how much detail we need to understand certain mechanisms or the methodology of certain papers and because of our more theoretical conversations or personal anecdotes, some of the lectures felt rushed. either way, I loved the experience. some confusion while studying for the exams was worth the amazing class dynamic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class discussions are great, and the class is a good mix of biological facts and social/cultural implications to be discussed. I think it would be better if more emphasis were placed on forming evolutionary hypotheses: i.e. more in-class exercises or take-home work focused on building the evolutionary thinking muscle. Also would of course be better if it were smaller, but I understand why that is not possible. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you can get in, you'll learn a lot and enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you can take this class, TAKE IT! I didn't make the initial cut of 30 students but was able to squeeze my way in off of the waitlist. The best class I've taken at Yale. Prof Valeggia really cares about you, your learning, and your experience in the class ad I don't know if I can say that about any other professor here (at least to her extent of caring). The material is fascinating and the environment Prof Valeggia creates is one that is safe inviting, enriching, and though provoking. Seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS!!! If you don't get in, she also teaches a larger lecture on overall human evolutionary bio in the spring and I hear it's great too. ",
            "\u00a0It is one of the best classes you can take. You will walk away with a far greater understanding of women's bodies and lives, something for which you will be immediately grateful (and probably more thankful for as time goes on). You will also feel close to, at least some of the people you had a chance to learn with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class if you can get in! Claudia is a gem. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is the best class I have taken at Yale and discusses seemingly controversial issues related to women's health extensively. ",
            "\u00a0I had some pretty wild expectations for the class based on its reviews and the number of people who shopped it. There are things that are great about it: Claudia is lovely, its super nice to start with a meditation each day, and the material is interesting. That being said, I found the discussions to be entirely lackluster, and really missed the critical thinking I thought would be a part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an excellent experience and Dr. Valeggia is a truly amazing teacher. I learned a lot, and I find myself thinking about the course material very frequently in day-to-day life. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! I didnt take it for a science credit but I think its a great class to get one! In general it was a really pleasant course and the material seems relevant especially if you identify as a woman! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this classit changed my relationship to science courses in general and really empowered me to make better decisions about my own body. Claudia is a gem as well! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great science credit, but you still get to learn and engage with some really interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I'm a senior and this is the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Honestly, there should be a lecture version of this so more people can take it. If you have the chance to take it, DO IT! You won't regret it. Prof. Valeggia is the most caring, kind, and charismatic professor I've met. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Valeggia is amazing and you will learn so much from her! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There's not much new I can add to the already gushing reviews that exist about this class, but I can tell you that everything you've already read is true. It's not often that I take \"life changing\" classes that turn out to actually be life changing, but this one is. I never realized how much I didn't know about my own body and my own life history, and I am so grateful to this class for opening my eyes and my mind. The information and experience this class will truly stick with me for the rest of my life. If you get in, take it. Do not hesitate, do not think about it, just take it. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this class to anyone considering it!! It was absolutely one of my favorite courses at Yale (even despite being very different from most of my other classes as a humanities major). Prof. Valeggia is so knowledgeable, kind and passionate and makes the course and subject a truly meaningful and relevant experience for all her students. You will definitely not regret taking this class and learn so much!! The workload is very fair and the material is really accessible for anyone who doesn't take many SC credits. I honestly wish the course didn't have to end, so take that as your cue to take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fun and not too challenging SC credit. I'm a WGSS major, and so from that standpoint, I would have preferred more theory in our readings and discussion -- it seemed a little bit that the class was crosslisted with WGSS simply because it is on women and sexual health, but we spent very little time actually talking about gender and sexuality in any sort of critical way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would fully recommend this class. The information I learned in this class has changed my life already in so many ways. I think almost everyone regardless of background or academic interests would find this class intriguing and important. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in women's reproduction, definitely. You will learn a lot. However, be warned you do need to study for the exams and the class kind of just runs as Claudia wants on that given day. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL CLASS, you question everything you think you know about being a girl, but more importantly, you question everything you think you know about being human. surprisingly, you do this through the lens of science instead of philosophy and there's something amazing about the intersection of objectivity and human vulnerability. DO IT ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the subject from any angle. I took this class as an E&EB student with no anthropology background other than an enduring casual interest in observing how people act and how societies function. This course helped me develop the skills to think about human societies from an anthropological and evolutionary perspective. The critiques were enjoyable and informative to write, and the midterms were very fair, testing the material we had learned effectively. The final project is what you make it--I made the time to delve very deeply into one subject, and I think that if you do this, you will get a huge amount out of this course. Also, take the time to get to know Claudia. She is a wonderful professor and an incredibly caring person. "
