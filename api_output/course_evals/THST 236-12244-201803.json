            "\u00a0I gained a wider perspective on the progression of American musical theatre as an art form, and gained some familiarity with many individual shows. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to analysis of shows themselves, the class covers the theory and historical context of musical theater. As someone who wants to go into the field professionally, it's an incredible survey course to have taken. A great combination of show structure and analysis with the history itself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at the American musical theater as a whole and not just as a sum of its parts, and to analyze musical theater songs musically, which is huge for those who don't know music theory very well. The course doesn't try to cover the entire history in one semester, but offers a great survey of the form. ",
            "\u00a0American Musical Theater is a topic that has been a personal interest during most of my life. This course allowed me to take a critical look at something that I saw as a non academic interest and something which in reality has no relevance to my major. I found the course incredibly engaging and challenging, and it allowed me to develop a critical eye when looking at theater and music in general, by looking at musical theater through a series of different lenses. Also as a student with a major which does not require much writing, the two writing assignments and weekly blog entries allowed me to develop my writing skills further. I thought the class would be a pretty on the surface overview of musical theater history, but the depth of analysis I was allowed to engage in was anything but on the surface. In the end, this class allowed me to flex some academic muscles which would otherwise be ignores. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about older musicals and the significance of Rodgers & Hammerstein and Sondheim in laying the foundation for the musical theatre we see today. I gained a much better knowledge of the musical theatre cannon and the trends in music, form, and commercialism that have always existed and continue to evolve today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze a piece musically! ",
            "\u00a0I gained an incredibly rich foundation in the history of American Musical Theater. I learned how to better approach theater as an active viewer, as well as how to clearly express my opinions on the AMT tradition. I learned how to be more analytical and how to direct my thinking and writing to be concise yet convincing. ",
            "\u00a0Broad overview of American Musical Theater history, starting in the 1920s and going all the way into the present day. Moderate amount of weekly reading (40-50 pages on average) and 2-3 musicals to listen to per week (takes a lot less time per show than seeing the whole show, though, since you're only listening to the songs and not dialogue). Perfect amount of homework to feel like you're learning a ton, but not feel overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nListened to 20-30 musicals over the course of the semester, which is awesome. Gained a totally new appreciation for the genre. \r\n\r\nThe work, beyond the homework, consisted of two analytical essays (each 10ish pages) as well as several shorter blog-post entries about particular topics. \r\nThe course also included a free trip to My Fair Lady on Broadway (with NICE tickets) as well as free transport there and back....it pays to go to Yale :) ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to analyze all aspects of the American Musical Theater, from the performance to the commerce, to understand the motives, influences, and artists responsible for the shows we adore. ",
            "\u00a0A very good historical and musical understanding of the development of the American musical, particularly how the form progressed and changed. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of the semester we examined the origins of the American musical theater, identified how the form has changed over time, and developed tools for analyzing musicals/songs as texts themselves. ",
            "\u00a0How to write better, express my argument, conduct musical analysis "

            "\u00a0I think the biggest strengths of the class were certainly the content and the atmosphere. If you like musicals even a little bit, it's a ton of fun to be able to think about and analyze them in an academic context. If you're more of a musical theater dabbler like me, it can really open up your eyes to how broad (or narrow, in another view) the scope of American musical theater is. I would say that a weakness of the course would be the class format/organization. Although Dan Egan tries very hard to make the class accessible to everyone, I think a lot of class discussion relied on having at least a rudimentary familiarity with the musicals we studied. We studied American musical theater history in chronological order for the most part, and I wasn't very familiar with any of the assigned listening until we got up to Rent and In the Heights (the third- and second-to-last weeks of class). I personally found it difficult to listen to something once or twice & then discuss it in depth, so I think reducing the number of musicals assigned per week could help improve the experience for people in the class with less musical theater exposure. (That would also help to solve the issue of us never getting to fully address every show we study because of time constraints  I still can't believe how little time we spent discussing Fiddler!) Beyond that, I think many of the discussion questions posed in class were too abstract or vague to really be able to grasp onto, and I often didn't feel comfortable answering them (or really able to address them at all) because I couldn't figure out what was being asked of me. It would have been better if the Canvas discussions started earlier in the semester, as that would have been a good way to learn how to better answer questions and express ideas about the topic in addition to being a good way to get a sense of what classmates are thinking going into a class meeting. (It is a WR credit, after all  I was definitely hoping to do more writing about the topic than we ultimately ended up doing.) ",
            "\u00a0Dan runs a tight ship. Discussions are fast paced and efficient. Classes cover a lot of material and are a great combination of lecture and discussion. The only thing I would suggest is to incentivize the readings more, since it is easy to get away with skipping them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wide variety of musicals are covered, working on musical analysis, great professor\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is its breadth. Even as someone quite familiar with the musical theater canon before this class, I was exposed to so many shows that were new to me. Our class discussions were always interesting and vital. The course has few weaknesses, in my opinion. A couple of weeks the assigned reading/listening load felt like a lot, but it was always my favorite work to do in any given week. ",
            "\u00a0The selection of shows we listened to seemed pretty varied, but sometimes there seemed to be little relation from one show to the next, in terms of themes, narrative and timeline. I don't know if that's something that can be helped, however, as the musical theater landscape is so  diverse. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Dan Egan and the amazing students in the class made discussions both entertaining and engaging. This class really made me think about musical theatre in a new way and introduced me to a bunch of new musicals that I continue to listen to on Spotify. Prof. Egan is very approachable and is always willing to meet to help with papers. Also- we got to go see My Fair Lady in NYC featuring Laura Benanti and Norbert Leo Butz! Truly an amazing experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Some of the musicals on the syllabus like Floyd Collins or Hello Again didn't seem as important as other musicals we could have focused on. Sometimes I still felt that there was a bit too much discussion of music theory. Overall, if you can read music (which is a requirement I think) you will be totally fine but you might not always have as much to say in some of the class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0It is really well taught and I have like no weaknesses to point to. Pretty great that there is a musical we get to see. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly strong in all regards. It is engaging, engrossing, and functions at a level that is both welcoming to all backgrounds but also challenging. Although it is merely an introduction into the world of American Musical Theater, it provides a broad survey that equally discusses each epoch from its inception up through modern day. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly amazing class. The workload was manageable, curriculum is well designed and readings complement the listening assignments perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0I truly can't think of much room for improvement. Classes were an ideal mixture of lecture, free-form conversation, and music analysis (and appreciation). I loved the musicals we discussed, and never felt like I had too much on my plate for this class. Writing was spaced out perfectly, so we could spend ample time creating our ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about the way this course was run, honestly. Sometimes I found the reading and listening assignments hard to balance. I wish it met two days a week instead of one! ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the almost hybrid structure of the class between lecture and seminar. I think it was a good balance of having free discussion while also still getting to the point for each class. On the other hand a drawback of that was that a lot of times discussion centered a lot on looking at the problems of the musicals rather than using what we were studying to inform our knowledge of the form. It's a tricky balance. I also think the class structured well in giving everyone in the room room to contribute. Whether that looked like for some who are less inclined to speak in class, highlighting their contributions on the blog or cold-calling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing subject matter, amazing teacher, super interesting readings, flexibility in paper topics\r\nWeaknesses: I guess some would say flexibility in assignments was a weakness. I disagree. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course has been my favorite so far at Yale. Professor Egan's enthusiasm about the subject matter is contagious and every class is a pleasure to attend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a lot of fun, you get to see a Broadway show for free, and it's not a ton of work. Just be sure to manage your time so that you're not staying up until 2am the night before class trying to cram in 3 hours of listening assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! No matter your familiarity with the genre, if you're interested in musical theater definitely apply. It's a great way to meet like-minded people and study work that has influenced you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone interested in exploring the ins and outs of the American musical theater, and especially to those interested in making a career out of it. It's a great way to jump start your understanding of the field. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Whether you're new to musical theater or know it well, you will benefit from working through this uniquely American genre with a group of your peers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to other students ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course was extremely enjoyable because I got to study and listen to musicals, which is something I already like to do in my free time. There is a totally reasonable amount of work and you will get to meet other Yalies who like musicals and have fun analyzing them as a class! However, you should know that this course is intended for students with a serious interest in musical theatre, theatre, or music. I took it as a STEM major and I was totally fine, but I did have pretty significant background knowledge about musicals and knew how to read music. The course usually requires an application (it's a simple application) but Prof. Egan is looking for a diverse group of students, so you don't need to be a senior or a theatre major to get in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Dan Egan is a man with a good heart and it shows in his teaching. Plus a free show. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student. The seminar environment creates a space that is conducive to forming close, intellectual relationships with all of one's peers. The content that is covered is incredibly interesting, and the guests that are brought to this class provide unparalleled insights into the world of musical theater. This is the best class I have taken during my short time at Yale. In particular, the wide variety readings and listenings keep you excited for each and every session of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Totally delivers on what it aims to be--a non-exhaustive but thought-provoking survey of the history of American Musical Theater. ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in musical theater, or performance in general. The class is engaging, a very entertaining writing credit, and Dan is a stellar teacher. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Dan is the best and it's a great class. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Such a fantastic class! I can't recommend it enough. You'll learn to think critically about musicals and appreciate them so much more because of it. Prof. Egan is an amazing instructor and a wonderful person. Discussions are engaging and often fun, and readings are interesting and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to those either just a little bit interested in musical theater to those very knowledgeable. The discussions are really engaging and Dan is the best. ",
            "\u00a0THIS CLASS IS SO GOOD, TAKE IT. I'm so grateful Prof. Egan allowed me to submit my application a couple hours after the deadline as I had just found out about it. "
