            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Earth, its climate systems, and the history of the changing climate. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to Earth's systems and geology. We learned a wide vary of environmental vocabulary in addition to tools for analyzing environmental data. ",
            "\u00a0The class painted a pretty clear picture of how earth and earth's climate has changed over time through the analysis of various proxies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the techniques used by climatologists to reconstruct Earth's past, the key findings obtained by these methods, and the relevance of these findings to the current politics of climate change and potential mitigation strategies. Along the way, I learned about techniques used by scientists to combine data from multiple sources and manage uncertainty. "

            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor gives out list of possible quiz and exam questions. Really forces us to study if we want any chance of getting a decent grade\r\nWeaknesses - Professor grades on a strict rubric system, making it so even some thorough and well-studied answers can only receive minimal credit unless every single specific point the professor wanted mentioned was included. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is that the lectures are very engaging and it was easy to ask questions, especially to our TA or over email. Sometimes, the assigned readings were a little overwhelming so I wish we had some guidance about which areas to focus on. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures went over interesting things. Could have been taught a little better. Quizzes and tests were fair. ",
            "\u00a0This course presented the key methods and findings of paleoclimatology in a detailed yet accessible way, effectively emphasizing the causes, timescales, magnitudes, and impacts of past climate changes. Understanding these past changes is key to evaluating evidence for current man-made climate change. The lectures were engaging. The assigned textbook readings were long and often dry, but could be used mostly for review of key topics. The course's use of quizzes instead of traditional homework helped reduce the workload, but the course still required several hours of focused studying every couple weeks.\r\n\r\nThe course's detailed discussion of paleoclimatological methods was part of what made it interesting, but sometimes made memorization overshadow the big-picture lessons of the content. More synthesis questions on quizzes, instead of just on exams, would have helped. The small class size made it seem like a more interactive lecture style could have been appropriate, but I'm not sure how it would have worked with the fact-heavy content. I would have appreciated more discussion of how the course's topics relate to climate projections -- this seemed to be implied throughout the course but never explicitly addressed. More discussion of the feasibility of the mitigation strategies mentioned would also have been interesting. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's interested in learning about the history of the climate. Keep in mind this is very much not a current events type class and focuses almost entirely on how Earth's climate has changed over time, starting quite literally from the creation of Earth. It's fascinating stuff though if that's what you're interested in. The professor is passionate and tries his best to make lectures interesting. Be prepared for quiz grading on a strict rubric system, so literally write all the information you can think of, no matter how tangentially related, if you hope to get full credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is both engaging and challenging, but not too overwhelming. I think lectures were more interesting than your standard Yale lecture because the textbook terms were related to current issues and modern day phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in learning about the details of Earth's climatic history and don't mind some memorization. The really neat part of this course is seeing how past climate changes relate to current \"debates\" over climate change, though this wasn't explicitly discussed as much as I would have liked. The quizzes instead of weekly homework assignments make this course relatively light workload, but be prepared for significant studying every so often, especially before exams. "
