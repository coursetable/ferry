            "\u00a0At this point in my academic and professional career, I did not think I could learn much more about the UN but then came along Tony Banbury. This is the type of class that any global affairs major should take given how relevant to course material is. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the UN. It was fantastic to learn from a highly experienced practitioner. ",

            "\u00a0Having someone like Tony giving the course is extremely important. Other people with a UN background would not have been able to do this course justice. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, there were some weeks in the middle when the topics were just REALLY boring. This is fine, but there should be some strategy to get people involved, like an activity. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was excellently structured and every assignment/reading was thoughtfully selected. I really appreciated the UN trip Tony put together for the class. He is a fantastic resource for students. ",

            "\u00a0No weakness. The greatest and the most helpful class I have taken from my Yale education. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussion in this course were of a very high caliber.  Assignments were similarly relevant and useful for comprehending and operationalizing course material.  Some sessions might be made more engaging through breaking up longer discussions into segments, bringing in outside speakers, and conducting in-depth studies of one active peacekeeping operation. ",
