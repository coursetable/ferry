            "\u00a0How to reason about ethical questions in practical and professional contexts ",
            "\u00a0Wrestling with the ethical questions that have shaped and are shaping journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Like any good seminar, I think I gained a lot more questions than answers, which is definitely a really good thing for a class like this. It's exactly what it sounds like -- it really developed my ability to consider ethical issues in the realm of journalism & question the behavior of the media today as well as my own actions & the actions of my peers as student journalists on campus. I now find myself very often re-evaluating different types of writing & reporting from an ethical standpoint, and I think that's a really good thing for me to be thinking about as someone who's thinking about going into journalism professionally. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I was challenged to think critically about the practices of journalism and the many different unavoidable ethical dilemmas that journalists find themselves in. I got to read fascinating works of journalism and critiques of journalistic decisions and learned a lot from my peers during class debates. I don't think I necessarily learned new cardinal rules about journalist ethics (because for the most part, they don't exist  although of course I reaffirmed how I feel about things like paying for sources, and learned about new conundrums like shield laws) but I was definitely exposed to new ways of making judgements about ethical decisions. I particularly enjoyed being able to talk about current events and contemporary journalism through this lens and felt like the class was an excellent mix of theoretical debate and particular case studies. I also gained new insight into how complex the world of journalistic ethics really is and was both surprised and relieved to find that some questions don't get easier to answer over time. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course I have taken in my Yale career. I learned how to think like a journalist, and gained a greater appreciation for the amount of work and ethical decision making that goes into articles. This class made me question how I approach journalistic ethical dilemmas in my own life. ",
            "\u00a0This class reads very interesting and thought-provoking books, and asks its students to delve into ethical dilemmas that professional journalists face. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how journalists aim to practice their profession in an ethical manner. I also learned how to apply moral philosophical ethics to the field of journalism, using the lens of ethics to evaluate practices in journalism. As a student with a philosophy background who is interested in journalism, it was really interesting to apply this background to journalism. I gained insights into the profession, as well. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a thorough and engaging survey of issues in journalistic ethics. We covered things like undercover reporting, shield laws, and publishing classified information. Weisberg was an able seminar instructor; he kept classes focused and interesting, and struck a great balance between him talking and students talking. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very practical course. I basically just learned a lot of ethical nuance in looking at journalism and learned how to develop a framework to evaluate journalistic ethics. The course is aptly named, by the end you definitely learn a lot more about the ethics of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a variety of ethical considerations that journalists are faced with. "

            "\u00a0Strength: an excellent and thoughtful practitioner who facilitates effective discussion and offers incredible feedback on student writing\r\nWeakness: got slightly repetitive at points ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jacob Weisberg, who's the editor of the Slate group, had so much insight and personal experience to share with us that really added to the class dynamic & discussion. The discussions were always fascinating and the readings were usually pretty interesting as well. I also really liked the \"bring your issues to class\" element of the seminar, in which the professor invited us to talk about any ethical issues we might have run into ourselves as journalists on campus, or about things going on in current events. \r\n Weaknesses: Sometimes discussions kind of veered off-track (more often taking advantage of the debate format that we utilized several times might have helped remedy that), but I don't think that was necessarily all bad, because the things we talked about were still relevant to the overall themes of the class. Also, I think we could have done a better job defining journalism up-front. (That was kind of a question that was unclear throughout the class, which sometimes hindered the productivity of discussion.) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well organized both in terms of the different topics we discussed and the order in which we covered them. I also liked the balance between talking about current events/ongoing ethical questions and concrete historical examples. I thought it was a great idea to incorporate debates into each class and appreciated being able to argue for a particular side, especially in a class where I was conscious of how I went back and forth on different ethical questions during our discussions. However, I would say the debates morphed over the course of the semester into a kind of scripted, competitive affair between a few people that everyone else observed, and maybe there is a way to make the debates more impromptu/informal/inclusive. Overall, I got the most out of the discussions that we had (probably more than most of the other seminars I've taken) and learned so much from Professor Weisberg and the other students in the class that I would have loved more time just to talk about things together. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent. Professor Weisberg is the best discussion moderator I have ever heard. Our entire class was discussion based, and it never got boring. Professor Weisberg always moved the conversation along and guided it without making anyone feel as though they were not heard. He always asked follow up questions that made you re-consider your opinions. Each week's topic was engaging and different, so nothing ever felt stale. I don't think it had any weaknesses, I truly looked forward to it each week. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is its rigorous class discussions where students from different political/journalism backgrounds can speak their mind. The course materials are also both timely and classic. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Weisberg is a fantastic professor - he gave helpful feedback on drafts given to him in advance of the deadline and was always accessible as well. His professional insights were a huge asset to this class. All of the readings were really interesting, and I thought the class was very well structured. Seminar was always led very well, and discussion was always lively. I can't think of any ways for the course to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was constructed in a really strong way. Each week's topic was engaging and the readings were mostly reasonable and well-curated. Weisberg's thoughtfulness and insight were huge strengths. I also really appreciated his willingness to look at paper drafts and give full notes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Weisberg is brilliant and so experienced so it was a pleasure to be in class with him. The discussions were usually very interesting and engaging in that Professor Weisberg asked us students what WE thought and would try to push our arguments to their logical conclusions. I also thought the workload was light which was nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I enjoyed some of the readings I thought some of them were a little pointless in that you could not do the reading, come to class, and  be a perfectly fine participant. I think we either should've focused on the details of the readings more, or had different readings. Additionally, I really enjoyed discussions, but they often got really carried away in terms of going off on tangents and people harping on irrelevant points. Finally, the class discussions sometimes turned into anti-Trump venting sessions. I hate Trump and the Republican party sometimes frustrates me, but I found this to be unproductive and too politicized. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the syllabus was great, the discussions were well facilitated, but I think that more shorter papers would be a better approach than two long papers. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Jacob Weisberg is an absolute legend who ALSO is great at teaching. PLSC brings in practitioners often, and Jacob is actually knowledgeable on content and with real-world experience. If he ever teaches anything again, you must take his class. The feedback he gives on drafts is unparalleled and discussion is always comfortable and fun. Excellent class, one of my favorite of these types of classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, do it just for the chance to work with Weisberg, the Editor-in-Chief of the Slate group ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Like I said before, Professor Weisberg is fabulous. He's got such an interesting perspective but always seems open to changing his mind if people offer solid counterarguments. I think talking about these topics is essential if you want to be a journalist, but I'd also strongly recommend this class to someone who's not interested in pursuing journalism professionally -- I couldn't imagine a class dynamic without the voices of non-journalists being heard as well (it would make class much less interesting, I think), and whatever the media is up to is super relevant for anyone and everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to students who are at all interested in journalism, even if that just means they keep up with the news. I think this class is particularly useful for students who write for publications and/or hope to go into journalism themselves, just because it's a good primer in the kinds of decisions we might have to make. However, the material is really accessible and the course is so focused on participation/conversation that it's easy to come in not knowing much and develop a strong opinion relatively quickly. Also, hearing about Professor Weisberg's experiences is always fascinating, and he brings in terrific guests! ",
            "\u00a0If you have the opportunity to take this class, you should take it 100%. I think this will be the course at Yale I tell my children about. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in journalism, even if they are not interested in journalism as a career. As a student with a background in philosophy who is interested in journalism but does not practice journalism on campus, I found this course to be enlightening and fascinating. Professor Weisberg is a fantastic professor who led the seminar very well and always gave helpful feedback. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class, especially if you're even toying with the idea of going into journalism as a career. Most of the time, the class just felt like a group of people sitting around having really interesting and lively discussions about topics from Watergate to coverage of Trump. Weisberg tells some great stories. The readings are minimal compared to many other classes, and they're all worth doing. The two papers are a kind of \"you get out what you put in\" experience - can be very fun because they're super open-ended. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the class to other students. It dealt with an interesting and important subject in a compelling and thoughtful way. The discussions were well-facilitated and engaging, and the guest lectures were excellent. I got a great base of knowledge in the subject. This was the first year that it was taught and I feel lucky to have been a part of it; I think getting in next year will be a challenge. I had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an awesome opportunity to learn from one of the best in the Journalism business who also happens to be a great teacher. I would recommend it purely on the basis that you get to have fascinating discussions with Professor Weisberg about ethics in a field that is very important in the current political climate. For those who have no interest in journalism or political things, this may not be your course, but if that's your wheelhouse then go for it. ",
            "\u00a0lt is worth knowing that people who are going into journalism will probably get more out of this class than other students. Its a fine class if youre not interested in going into journalism, but its not a must take course. "
