It's unnecessarily difficult because nothing is explained well and questions are worded in such a way that they are actually pretty simple to solve, but it will take you a good amount of time to parse their wording and figure out what exactly is being asked from you. \r\nYou are also asked to answer many VERY broad discussion questions on homework and quizzes. If you don't take these extremely broad questions and answer with the one or two *specific* points the TAs (who have an axe to grind when grading -- who hurt them?) are looking for, you get an automatic 2/5 or worse on that particular question even if your answer is objectively more complete.

            "\u00a0I felt that this course covered perhaps too many concepts, many with an inconsistent level of detail - of course this is a difficulty in intro courses in highly mathematical, but I felt that Professor Bailyn could've done a better job critically examining his choices of lecture materials from a (hypothetical) student's perspective. The lectures sometimes lacked cohesion and I was sometimes frustrated that concepts were either explained superficially (e.g. spacetime diagrams) or far too technically (e.g. Kerr metric), and that Professor Bailyn seemed to be differentiating these modes of explanation purely by what he found more interesting, or what was perhaps more relevant to his individual work/field. I feel that the course needs a stronger structure/overall narrative and more consistency in lectures. The material, however, was generally fascinating and I feel that the course has potential to become one of the Yale greats with some modifications. Professor Bailyn is an excellent lecturer; perhaps he just needs more perspective/experience with this course. The one major fault I found was with the P-sets, which were generally difficult and graded based on standards that were extremely unclear to students. Grading expectations/standards should be made far more clear IN ADVANCE - students are not mind readers, and the rubrics felt quite arbitrary. This applies equally to the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Grading was very tough and often seemed unfair. Course title was misleading - way too difficult for an \"intro\" course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good organization, interesting material, reasonable grade distribution\r\nWeaknesses: the location, not a big fan of the way PSET's were graded (4/5 for being accurate), but understand why that was done that way ",
            "\u00a0Great content, super interesting. P Sets are challenging, but overall course grading is pretty fair. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course was clarity of expectations -- 8 problem sets in and I'm still not entirely sure what types of responses were deserving of full credit for more qualitative questions. Also, please use Piazza instead of Canvas discussion forums. ",
            "\u00a0Better teaching assistants and more straightforward problem sets. By straightforward I dont necessarily mean easier, but for a number of problem sets, it felt like the questions were worded in a way that would only make sense if you went to office hours and had the TA explain what it was asking. ",
            "\u00a0It has an interesting concept! Professor Bailyn is very interesting and excited about the material, and was constantly having fun relearning the material with us. The psets were fair-ish(more on that later), but office hours were limited for such a difficult course. In addition, most of the TAs were genuinely interested in helping us learn the material.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think grading needs to be fixed. Often, you could write the correct answer on a pset, or something that answers the question well - however, that wouldn't mean you got a good score. Good scores were dependent on giving the answers expected. This made the \"discussion questions\" rather difficult, as you would have an answer, but if it wasn't what was expected then there wasn't a chance of getting a decent score on the pset. I also think grading was extremely dependent on the TAs and there wasn't enough consistency. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the course was fascinating! However, as we got deeper in general relativity stuff, I felt we were just skimming over the concepts and formulas, and not fully understanding what were the implications of them. I also enjoyed the fact that Professor Bailyn added some historical background. ",
            "\u00a0The professor spent a lot of time talking about how scientific research is conducted and the philosophy regarding science, which was interesting but often a bit too drawn out. Often times, he would explain the process of scientific research through personal experience without really providing extensive research or detailed pictures of how scientific research worked. As a result, I only got a vague overview of science as a collaborative effort. \r\nFurthermore, in problem sets and midterms, we would be graded much more harshly on our written explanations on scientific philosophy, but I don't think that we really delved deep enough into that area of the course in order to answer accordingly.\r\nRather than spending so much time on the way scientific research is conducted, I wish we could have spent more time discussing the math related to relativity. I often had a lot of trouble with completing the problem sets, and that could perhaps be alleviated by having the lecture be much more focused on the theory itself and its mathematical implications. \r\nAlso, it was really difficult going back to the powerpoints to review the content for midterms and finals, because the powerpoints don't explain concepts well and are often very repetitive. I found myself relying a lot of wikipedia to understand concepts instead. ",
            "\u00a0The inconsistencies between TAs was terrible-- grading was so arbitrary! Psets were absurdly difficult to the point where I truly didn't understand anything. Lectures were boring and confusing-- didn't understand anything that was happening! This was supposed to be a course for non-science people and it absolutely was not. ",
            "\u00a0I think the Psets, midterms, and final were straightforward and fair. The lectures were also engaging and accessible, but the powerpoint slides could be confusing sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly struggle to find a strength of this course. The course itself was falsely  advertised as something that would be doable for non-STEM majors. I found that I regularly struggled to grasp concepts and the constant explaining and defense of the grading system only made me more confused. If he has to spend 30 minutes each class going over how hell grade the assignments and how he wont accept re-grading requests because he doesnt want to re-read your responses then theres probably something wrong with the system, no? He (being the professor) moved so quickly during the lectures that my notes are just refer to the powerpoint. Im sure the professor is a good person, he just has NO BUISNESS teaching a class like this while also serving his first year as Head of College. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: everything. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I'll let you know when I find them.\r\nWeaknesses: Everything. The arbitrary nature of the grading, the constantly-changing schedule, the final (expectations were NOT clear for this final -- it seemed to have been designed to screw everyone out of an A), the irrelevance of problem sets to lecture, lack of office hours times (T/W 10-11am? We have this thing called other classes during the day...). Prof. Bailyn seems like a very nice person, but this course was what a train wreck wants to be when it grows up. Also, he openly looks down on students who care about grades -- he's one of those professors who thinks \"grades don't matter.\" Of course they don't matter for him -- he's the professor...? ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Bailyn. At 9:25 MWF, it's hard to keep student's attention, and Bailyn did it with moderate success. He's at his best at office hours, however, and has an uncanny ability to kind of parse out what, exactly, you are confused about when you ask a question and give precise, targeted answers. The weaknesses of this course are the TFs, who seemed in general, unorganized and uncooperative. The weekly problem sets are challenging  I went to office hours every week and some of the wording and demands of the class were unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Bailyn is very knowledgeable and a pretty interesting lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures didn't help you do the problems on the pset that well and the psets and quizzes were graded very arbitrarily. The topics were very hard to understand and it did not seem like a course for non STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the professor is awesome and the material is interesting. The weaknesses are that there is only one of the professor and the material can at times be a black hole (pun intended). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Awesome course material. Great professor who cares about the material. Really interesting to go over the concepts of relativity, but the professor also focused on the history of these discoveries, decisions for Nobel Prizes in the field, etc. I really enjoyed this component of the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: MWF 9:25-10:15. Also, we spent a lot of time discussing the logistics of the course, I wish the professor just wrote this information in the syllabus (the most prominent being which percentages were assigned to which grades. Even now, I still don't know what grade an A is, only that the cutoff for an A- is 80%.) ",
            "\u00a0This course was AWFUL. Impossible to do well and I continueay got knocked down every day. Every class I was so confused that I didn't even know what questions to ask. And if you had questions to ask you had to go to office hours where there was one TA who couldn't answer any questions and 40 other students ahead of you. Th grading was abismal and you got half credit for the right answer. Definitely not for science majors and unless you want to major in astrophysics DO NOT TAKE IT ",
            "\u00a0Some of the math was brushed over in class, yet difficult on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in the breath of material covered. I felt like I learned alot about relativity. The lectures were engaging. Working out more problems in class could help ",
            "\u00a0The first problem with this course is that a correct answer would be a 4/5. The rubric and guidelines were extremely arbitrary. We had to \"impress\" the grader to get a 5/5, a subjective guideline. The problem sets were nothing like what we covered in class, oftentimes unnecessarily complex and confusing to the point where not even the TAs could answer them. We did not start doing problems of the day until the last third of the course, which should have been done much sooner. There were complaints about how we never did problems by hand in class (instead they were written on the powerpoint), yet we exclusively learned material from the powerpoint slides.\r\n\r\nAlso, I like that there is no curve so we are not in competition with each other. However, on the third quiz, the mean was a failing grade, which insinuates that it was an unfair exam, not that no one had studied the material. Points would be taken off for arbitrary reasons and after speaking to the graders, there was still no reason points should have been taken off, other than it was not exactly what the graders envisioned as the answer. The questions on theory were graded really hard and not well explained in class. We would often zoom through complicated concepts without full explanation.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate the problem of the day method for attendance. I also appreciate how this class was for non-STEM majors, but this class was still extremely complicated and difficult with a lot of studying. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were clear, well-organized, and very helpful. The level of difficulty in the PSets was not continuous with the level of content in lecture--often felt unequipped to tackle them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that you can drop one midterm and 2 psets. The professor was also very clear with instructions and held regular office hours. However the fact that you had to attend 9:25am lecture every day made the attendance component of the grade difficult and the final was also tedious. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty cool in the sense that it endeavored to teach a very complex topic (relativity) to those who wouldn't ordinarily gravitate towards classes in physics or astronomy. However, as cool as some lectures and concepts could be, I felt they were often taught in too little detail to apply during exams and in problem sets. Lectures at times veered off on unhelpful tangents, and while some of these could be interesting, they were not relevant and distracted from the core material. The expectations for problem sets and exams were very difficult to figure out, and grading of the two was inconsistent. In general, I liked the part of the class where I actually learned about otherwise inaccessible concepts, but the course had issues in actually conveying how much of those topics we needed to understand. ",
            "\u00a0It was marketed as a gut. It is not a gut. Do not be fooled. The professor should be more honest about the amount of work that this course will take. Additionally, the final should not be so difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized and engaging each morning. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: A few of the TFs were a bit frustrating to work with during office hours (while we were trying to figure out the problem sets), but not all. Professor Bailyn stopped showing up at OH near the end of the semester, so I struggled a bit, but also I understand fully because he's a professor and Head of College with tons of other stuff on his hands.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I love Bailyn's grading policy; it's forgiving, and makes the class more about learning than about stressing over points. Open notes policy for all quizzes and the final reduced my stress levels significantly, but don't get me wrong I still had to work to get good grades. Which I appreciated. His problem sets were challenging and a joy to think about. Lectures were captivating. Bailyn put his heart and soul into each class, and I showed up to every 9:25 a.m. lecture because of his contagious passion for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - grading policy was silly and TFs didnt know what they were doing. Explanations were rarely sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately this course was quite deceptively marketed, with easy early lectures to boost enrollment numbers followed by time-consuming psets and lectures that sometimes drifted into fluff rather than clear and detailed explanation of the material at hand. Psets were difficult to complete passably without going to office hours. The final was as hard as a pset. It's all very well to want to actually teach students something, but don't market it as a gut to get people signed up to buy your book. ",
            "\u00a0I found the tests extremely difficult in comparison to the problem sets and would have liked a bit more guidance on how to do the mathamatical problems and how to pick apart word problems to actually know what they are asking. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. Professor Bailyn is incredible, passionate, and very committed to his students' learning. The material is incredibly interesting. Two weaknesses: office hours (similar to all other office hours I've attended in STEM) are pretty stressful, and it is sometimes hard to get your answers questioned. The comments written by TAs on the graded problem sets were sometimes illegible, or just unclear. I was sometimes confused about what I had done wrong in a problem, or what I had left out. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, but the course was given extremely poorly. It was poorly organized, feedback was unclear, and the instructor was nonchalant at best about legitimate concerns and petitions for change. ",
            "\u00a0The main problem of the course was the lack of TFs. At times, a single TF would be grading more than 50 psets in one week. More than once, TFs would make simple calculation errors in tallying up the points for an assignment; then it would take weeks for Prof Bailyn to respond to requests for a regrade. Psets and midterms would be returned without a single comment, which did not improve my learning, since I didn't know what mistakes I made. Office hours were not helpful, as the TFs were not prepared to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0There are no strengths to this course. The multiple weaknesses are as follows: \r\n(1) Lack of clear instruction (on Prof. Bailyn's part). Completing the problem sets often required a lot of outside research to fully understand what the questions were asking, which seems unnecessary for a class that didn't require any prerequisites. \r\n(2) Frustrating grading schema. Bailyn did spend nearly 20 minutes of precious review time trying to explain his grading philosophy, but I still think that some of the grading done in this class was absolutely nonsensical. For example, with Quiz 2, we left the quiz knowing that it was out of 24 points. But the next week, we find out that it will be out of 25 points because someone answered a question so well that they got an extra point. So, everyone who got a \"perfect\" score on the quiz (24 points) ended up getting a 24/25. How is that fair???? That's also NOT how bonus points work. ",
            "\u00a0The way Bailyn designed the curriculum really allows you to learn for the sake of learning rather than spend hours memorizing formulas to get 3 extra points on an exam. Especially if you're even vaguely interested in astronomy or physics, the topics are really interesting, and Bailyn is also an incredible lecturer. The only criticism I would have for the course is the grading. The TA's had significantly different grading standards and the answer keys and their explanations would often be vague and confusing. I'm not sure how it will be in future years, but I found the TA's unfortunately unhelpful and unnecessarily harsh on grading problem sets and midterms. Despite that, Bailyn's teaching and the course topics definitely outweigh that minor flaw. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class was great and the professor engaging. The content was very interesting itself and the problem sets required you to delve deeper into what we learned in class. As a result, several times, the psets were extremely hard to do without going to office hours and getting that extra information and concepts from TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course, especially since I had never taken an astronomy course or anything similar before, but it felt like what we were discussing in class was inconsistent with what was on the problem sets and exams. This was particularly true for the historical aspect of the class, in which we talked about the development of the field of relativity. While this was definitely an interesting topic, it took up a significant portion of the lectures, and I wish that more of that time had been spent discussing the math, physics, and conceptual aspects of relativity, which the psets and exams tested much more heavily (though this got a bit better as the class went on). The professor did explain to us that good learning can come from teaching oneself, but (as someone with a basic knowledge of physics and calculus, and no prior astro knowledge) I felt like the psets were impossible to do well on without being helped by multiple peers and the TFs - which isn't exactly teaching myself. \r\n\r\nAlso, despite the fact that the class's curve is what makes it most accessible for non-science majors, the grading was sometimes unnecessarily harsh. Oftentimes students were given 3/5 points if they answered questions correctly based on what we had learned, and were only given full points for above-average understanding. Given that this was an intro class, students should be graded according to what they are expected to know based on the material taught in lecture and the readings, not for outside knowledge or the ability to put in excessive time and effort.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, it would probably be in the professor's best interest to cut out the last part of the course which, while very interesting, built less on what we had learned prior, making it much more confusing. I would have been content to learn just the first two parts on special and general relativity, at a slower pace so I could truly understand them, and leave the black holes/pulsars/etc. for a later course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was not feasible in its design. Relativity should not be taught as a non-QR, or at least the way that Bailyn did it. Things that were given, such as formulas and explanations, simply required a better mathematical explanation than we ever recieved. ",
            "\u00a0This course is advertised as for non-science majors and as an easy introduction to relativity but it is NOT. Only take this course if you are exceptionally interested in the subject but have no background in it. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest issue I had with the course was with the grading structure. I think Professor Bailyn's philosophy as he explained it in class made a lot of sense, but in practice I found it to be unworkable and frustrating. The conceit of allowing an 80% to be an A- is fine, obviously, especially in the absence of a curve, but the decision to then make a 4/5 a perfectly correct answer on a number of discussion problems caused a number of problems as did the fact that the discussion questions frequently extended beyond scientific concepts on problem sets and forced the TAs to deal with unfamiliar subjects and led them to resort to the guide Professor Bailyn provided, which is fine for purely calculation-based questions, but there is rarely one right answer to a discussion question and I found that the TAs frequently failed to grasp that or that the perspective taken in the grading was far too black and white. I also felt, as did a number of other people in the class, that the TAs were frequently out to \"get you\" and spent a lot of time looking to find ways to dock points rather than focusing on the content of the response. In addition, the idea to make the quizzes and tests open notes was not particularly helpful I think. Professor Bailyn's examinations took the whole class or exam period and didn't really allow for much opportunity to look at notes, so much of the work came from memory anyways. It felt that, especially on the third quiz, where the class average was like a 60, and on the final, that the fact that the examination was open-book was used to make it very difficult and deal with concepts that weren't really covered properly in class and that was to the detriment of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - excellent tuition, fascinating material, interesting problem sets, feeling fully prepared for the exam given the level of support.\r\nWeaknesses - no clear weaknesses, although some parts of the material can be a little tricky (both conceptually and when applying equations etc for problems) ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good lecture style and the professor definitely enjoyed the material. While sometimes problem sets were graded harshly/hard to follow, the grading curve made this a pretty fair class overall. Adding/dropping quizzes and tests is very fair. The worst things were probably the final exam (everyone got rocked) and the fact that TAs weren't given the problem set answers beforehand so sometimes office hours wasn't very helpful/ led to the wrong answer. This is definitely made for non-science students in mind. While the topics were difficult to understand, the problems weren't particularly brutal. The hardest part was the concepts rather than the work. "

This was the first time they offered it, and I'm sure improvements will be made for its next iteration - but I would inquire as to those improvements before committing. The course material really was fascinating and generally mind-bending, and it was a thorough introduction to the history of and current research in such fields as relativistic astrophysics, theoretical physics, observational astronomy and cosmology. Professor Bailyn is a fantastic and passionate lecturer with incredible stories of his adventures in the field (it does seem that he knows half of the course's notable figures personally). However, the course was rather inconsistent in the detail in which topics were covered, which seemed to vary randomly, and the lectures/course sometimes lacked cohesion. The grading on the P-sets and quizzes was quite arbitrary, as neither specific nor general rubrics were ever shared with the students and many questions were written discussion questions (i.e. subjective). Same with the quizzes. TAs were generally very helpful, especially Arthur Adams - he was a great resource. If Charles manages to fix a good portion of these organizational problems and gains a better sense of how undergraduates react to the materials he's presenting as new concepts, this course would be quite excellent; if not, be prepared to debate most of the grades you receive.

            "\u00a0I recommend this with caution. I enjoyed it to a certain extent regardless of grades because I enjoy this material, and I was looking forward to the material in a practical sense. However, this is strongly a science/qr geared towards those in humanities majors. In addition, I HIGHLY caution taking this if you have taken higher level math or have not done this kind of basic y=mx+b math in a long time as this is the fundamental of the math in the course. The weekly psets are also a drain as they often are not able to be started right away (as the lectures often get behind due to the nature of the material) and there aren't enough office hours.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this was the first iteration of the course. There are sure to be improvements and better organization as time goes on. ",

That being said, it's not the class to take if your looking for a gut, or something that will guarantee you an A.

The course lectures were not conducive to actually doing the PSET's and we often had to rely heavily on the TA's to learn the material.

Expect to have to teach most of the material to yourself (or have the TFs teach you during office hours) because Bailyn will spend most of lecture talking about the history of the field and its major players which, while interesting, is not what you will be tested on for the most part.
