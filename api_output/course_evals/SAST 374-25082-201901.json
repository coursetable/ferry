            "\u00a0South Asia arch and art ",
            "\u00a0What draws me to art history courses is that, at the end of the day, no matter what I learn in terms of themes and overarching ideas, I always end up at the very least learning a lot of specific information about individual works of art. However, this course was incredibly theme-heavy which really invigorated the experience of discussing specific works. Specifically, the historiographical discussions we had about South Asian art history taught me a lot conceptually, well beyond just the works that we were responsible for learning. Professor Kaligotla did an excellent job of interrogating the legacy of colonialism without allowing these discussions to overshadow the works + artists themselves. In particular, the article about French orientalist depictions of Algeria exemplifies the way in which we approached course material conceptually. Overall, I found the curricular structure to be excellent. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about sacred space, how it was structured and why, what it was made of, and what its historical significance was. I really enjoyed the material and I learned a lot from lecture and section about the Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic religions and their art and architecture across the Indian subcontinent. It made me want to learn more about Indian history. I would have preferred to learn more about different structures from an Indian perspective, rather than the couple of weeks we spent on British perspective. "

            "\u00a0I thought this was an odd fusion of lecture presentation and discussion. I think our engagement with the course would have been better if it was a seminar with a presentation component. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was a great course! Focusing on historiography and the region's history was especially great. ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of memorization, dry lectures with a lot of irrelevant names and dates. I dont feel like I learned very much about the actual religious lives and practices of people who worshiped in the spaces we looked at. And a lot of them were tombs or royal monuments that you could be looked at as sacred spaces, but we never discussed in class what it would mean to think of those spaces as sacred in their own rights. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great ",
            "\u00a0I think the way lecture and section were structured was great. They worked really well together and integrated the material in a way that helped me retain it from week to week, which I really appreciated. I also thought the readings were really interesting, and I liked that the course really asks you to interact with the authors' arguments, even in the exams, which isn't often asked of you in art history courses. It made the class really well-rounded. I don't think I really got anything out of the writing assignments, though. The prompt for the first writing assignment was pretty vague and graded weirdly. I didn't get any great feedback because it seemed like the prompt had changed since we had turned the paper in, which was pretty disappointing. The second writing assignment was fine, but felt more like a reading response than a writing assignment because we only focused on one reading, and we didn't have much background on the subject yet. So overall, I think the structure of the writing assignments could definitely be improved. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. This course has such a broad range of significant contentfrom the art itself, to discussions of archaeology (at the beginning of the term), to religion, to colonialism and historiography. For this reason, the class would be both interesting to students interested in art history and instructive to students who havent taken much art history and need a broad overview of what it entails.
