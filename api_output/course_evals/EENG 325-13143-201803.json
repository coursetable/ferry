            "\u00a0I *actually* learned how circuits work! ",
            "\u00a0I gained more experience with circuits, especially concerning transistors and amplifiers. We covered basics of diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETs, and their uses as amplifiers. Intro to differential amplifiers, current mirrors, multistage amplifiers, and frequency response ",
            "\u00a0I learned about circuits, specifically amplifiers, in depth. I felt that I also developed a stronger understanding of the machines in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0although not required for non-ABET electical engineers, I thought this course was fantastic for improving my ability to analyze circuits! This class went far beyond the intro sequence since it built to multi-stage circuit configurations. It also covered some of the physics behind semiconductors, in a way that provided a basic understanding of them, without becoming a semiconductors class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to build and use various types of electric circuits like rectifiers and amplifiers using non-linear devices like diodes, MOSFETs, and BJTs. "

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was Xia and the organization.  Xia is an EE prof who can actually teach(!!), and he did a superb job breaking down complex topics.  The biggest weakness of this course was feedback; I didn't get all of my labs back, so I'm not sure how I did with them. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: well organized\r\n\r\nWeakness: intro into diode physics was fast (but luckily not a main part of class so not really tested) ",
            "\u00a0It was pretty fast-paced and very in-depth, which is what I expected from this course, but still found difficult about it (which I supplemented with office hours). It was also very well organized. I would have liked feedback on lab reports earlier in the year however. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the professor and his ability to clearly explain the topics, the textbook with its numerous examples, and the labs which demonstrate the relevancy of the material to real-world applications ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear, effective instruction; interesting course material; homework and labs reinforced concepts covered in lecture well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Limited feedback on labs. "

He's a great professor, and thanks to this course I *actually* understand what MOSFETs, BJTs and diodes are and how they work together to create circuits.  This is Yale's best circuits course (out of EE200 with Reed, 203 with Hong, and 325 with Xia), so I recommend it wholeheartedly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good class taught by a good professor. I'm not the greatest fan of circuit analysis but still enjoyed this class ",
            "\u00a0would recommend to any EE or physics student wishing to improve circuit analysis and understand how transistors can form amplifiers. "
