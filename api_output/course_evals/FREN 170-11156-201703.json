            "\u00a0to discuss complex literary concepts in French, allowing me to improve my French speaking and writing capacities ",

            "\u00a0This class is a phenomenal introduction to the French literary canon as it was meant to be read: in the beautiful original French. In addition to reading wonderful French texts, we learned how to speak and write in French about French literature, too. This course, led by the fantastic Madame Pinzka, dug deeply into every single work we read and taught us how to perform rigorous critical analysis in French. It is a perfect jumping-off point for further study of French literature. "

            "\u00a0There were plenty of diverse discussions, materials and resources that made this course comprehensive and very helpful. I cannot think of anything I would change about the course's structure. I liked that the works we studied spanned a wide range of eras, topics and styles. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting discussion good workload ",
            "\u00a0This course is full of strengths, and I cannot think of a single weakness. The class's central strength is the discussion format: every discussion is fascinating and exciting, and the professor actively participates, facilitating the conversation without dominating it. The work -- one 1-page essay for each major new piece of literature you start, plus two extended essays -- is not at all overwhelming. It ends up being both enjoyable and extremely useful, and what you write in your short essays will go a long way in helping you know what you want to say in discussion. And finally, the professor, Madame Pinzka, is a truly wonderful professor and human being. I can't say enough good things about this class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall. No complaints. "

            "\u00a0Yes because it challenges students to expand their use of French to communicate more complex ideas ",
            "\u00a0Yes to practice french ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially any person at all interested in French literature or who thinks they might live/work in France or any francophone country someday. These works are at the heart of the French literary canon. References to them exist everywhere -- in novels, in poems, in movies, and beyond. This course will help you deeply appreciate the brilliance of those works, and you will dramatically improve your written and spoken French along the way. ",
            "\u00a0AbsolutelyI would encourage non-French-speakers to take this course if it were possible. "
