            "\u00a0While I think that Prof. Wininger genuinely cared about the class, the teaching style that he used was totally not useful to me. Instead of reviewing the material from the book in his own words to reinforce the ideas in a new way, he would just copy straight from the book. He also would not teach a lot of the material, he would just put it up on the board in his notes and then circle things that were hard to see even sitting very close to the front of the room. He rarely did out examples full examples in class, which are very useful for understanding material like statistics. This class was mostly about teaching yourself the material outside of class. I would often go to class hoping to gain a better understanding of what I had read in the book, but I would leave with no more knowledge than I came in with.\r\n\r\nI think that he relied too heavily on the book and used it somewhat like a crutch.

It is very challenging to teach this content to multiple levels. ",

The exams were inconsistent with class material and were significantly harder than any homework or assignments we may have gotten in class.  We had three different exams, aside from the final, and each exam was set up differently.  I understand that he was a new professor and was trying out different exam styles, but it was not fair to the students.  The TFs had to teach us R entirely by themselves during lab where they would often get frustrated (completely understandable) that we would all come in knowing absolutely nothing. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this was a very good, thoughtful course. ",
            "\u00a0This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. It is hard to express how much stress it gave me, unnecessarily. Math isnt really my thing, but I came into this course with a positive attitude. I couldnt believe how demoralizing and simultaneously useless this course was. Let me break down what could be improved:\r\n\r\n1. This was NOT designed as a core class. As a health policy student, I DID want to learn bio stats, because statistics can be really useful in policy, but in a broad way. It was impossible to get the main concepts out of this class with the lack of organization. It could be useful if it were more like  okay, heres an issue, here are the 3 things you would do/think as a public health professional if you see this. Instead he answered every q and proposed every topic as if we were in training to become statisticians. We, mostly, are not. All of the bio stats students arent even in our class. \r\n\r\n2.I left every lab for the first two months (and some towards the end) with a racing heart and cold sweats. WHY is this such a common things my friends and I experienced. I arrived to my first lab section and the tf (and mike!?!) expected me to just open up r and get some results. WHAT? I didnt even know whAt command prompt or r script is. To me, this is an unacceptable level of negligence, considering they quizzed us in the beginning of class so must have known some of us have never opened r in our lives. I dont think we should have had to learn it over the summer. I DO think there needed to be an intro class that was actually Taught!!! This could be way better if we worked over a longer period of time, maybe on more in depth projects that lasted a month or so.\r\n\r\n3. Noooo coordination of tfs. Some (okay, just one...) were excelllent teachers, others thought of themselves more as babysitters with advanced r knowledge. Mike supported this variation for some reason. \r\n\r\n4. The sheer amount of documents posted is unwieldy and it is impossible to actually keep up with this course. The homeworks are NOT useful learning tools. WTF are 13 page homeworks where new r code is introduced in every problems answer code. So if youre introducing new concepts in an answer key, thats not homework, its just a useless document that you will later unfairly test us on. I dont know anyone who found them helpful as written, though some found them useful to review the answers for. This was SO demoralizing, as it felt like there is always soooo much else out there to learn and Ive never really grasped anything. \r\n\r\n5. The assessments. Are. Ridiculous. We are tested on stray comments prof makes in class, they are for some reason all written like riddles, and I never once felt like I knew what the main concepts he was trying to test us on were. I got better at recognizing what random nonsense the professor will test us on, but not at actually learning. None of the above questions where we havent heard of the r code in some of the questions is just testing our guessing ability, not stats knowledge. Please do an assessment where you compare performance on these with how much people knew about stats before entering. \r\n\r\n6. I will review the lecture experience in the professor section, but spoiler alert: the lectures were useless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = learning R, which is very helpful \r\nWeaknesses = In the beginning of the semester the class was very unorganized in terms of instruction. R was not taught well and I think the professor would learn from other computing professors in how to initially teach this material. A summer tutorial through an online teaching software would be helpful so students have some initial exposure to the software. For example, swirl stats is a great example. Also, there seems to be a lot of trick questions on exams that don't test your knowledge, but rather test how well you can read the professors mind. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as though fairly basic and fundamental concepts and applications were made more complicated and difficult to learn than was necessary. I think lab primers could be distributed in advance of the class in order for students to truly gain critical skills in R. ",
            "\u00a0It is a difficult course that should have been split into two: biostatistics and R. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0Strenghs: review the basic knowledge of statistics knowledge carefully and  thoroughly; teach students to use R and write simple codes.\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe a little hard for people who don't have background knowledge and sometimes it's not easy to understand the line of thought in class. ",
            "\u00a0The labs and lectures can be more organized ",
            "\u00a0WOW, what a rollercoaster!!! Three major things I thought were very challenging: 1. The extra credit structure in the course. It wasn't until the last lecture that we realized the extra points could inflate lab/quiz grades to over 100%. Going through the course, extra credit was seen as a reward for students who were understanding course material, not as a help to students who were not doing well and really needed it. Left a large divide in the class with a perceived few number of students in the middle. Might reconsider this style? and 2. Document overload. Between study guides and homework, and answer and lecture slides and lecture notes and readings and primers and worksheet and and and it was sometimes hard to sift through. I found the documents that were easy for me to follow and the documents with little mistakes/missing information and went with those to study and supplement the course and it seemed to work out okay for me. 3. Test questions: I resolved to learn the material for the sake of learning it because thats why I decided to come to YSPH rather than to become proficient with R or biostats or even learning material to pass one of Winninger's mind game exams that was more like a word puzzle. Thankfully I did okay, but often left exams feeling completely defeated after spending hours studying and extra time outside of class to receive the grades I did. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The course was designed well to cover both coding in R and statistical concepts. it would have been nice to have a little more R coding in class and more time to do labs every week. It also would have been nice to have a smaller class size or a discussion session for small groups to meet with the instructor or a TF. Regardless though, Professor Wininger did an excellent job catering to the needs and demands of the students, adjusting his teaching style to make the class happier. Personally though, I enjoyed his original, organic, style of teaching. He went absolutely above and beyond to provide the class with the resources and materials to succeed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0It provided a good foundation in statistics and also R. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly, poorly designed, and taught in a completely ineffective way. ",
            "\u00a0I never say this lightly, but this class was one of the worst ones I have ever taken- \r\nthe material wasn't very difficult and in fact it is critical for our knowledge as future epidemiologists, however, the way the class was structured, taught, and organized was utterly horrible and unfair to us. biostats is the foundation of our data analysis skills and it is really unfair that we did not get a chance to develop these skills in a strong manner, instead we had to suffer due to the organization of this course.\r\nthe whole structure of where we HAD to read the textbook before the class, else we would have no idea what the instructor was talking about, was difficult and seemed like we had to teach everything to ourselves before even coming to class. the instructor literally would never go over stuff or actually \"teach\" biostats- it was more summarizing the textbook with the assumption that we know what's happening. Biostats needs to be taught on a whiteboard with examples, not using an iPad where the font projected on the screen is 12p and not even visible from the back of the room.\r\nthe whole merging of biostats + R is a very good thing but was done in the worst possible manner- without even teaching us anything, a lot of material was usually just posted online for our discretion and labs were structured in a way where we worked with data-sets. I think the labs were the best part of the course, since it helped us work with real-life datasets and practically develop skills, however this was again contingent on the assumption that the student has gone over the material and taught themselves everything.\r\nreally unfair for some students who may not have any stats background- for me, i did come in with some experience but still struggled to understand the organization of this course. i hope the appropriate people decide to change things for new students next year. ",
            "\u00a0I have mixed feelings about this course. I want to begin by saying Mike consistently went above and beyond, and his dedication to the course and his students could not have been more clear. I always felt comfortable asking for help, and I strongly believe that he wanted me to succeed . That being said, I struggled with the structure of the course and did not find it conducive to learning introductory biostatistics. Incorporating R, which is undoubtedly an important skill, distracted me from truly grasping basic principles, and I found myself at times trying to memorize R code as opposed to making sure I understood the concepts. I think this class would be best taught without an additionally language. Additionally, our textbook had no connection to R, but we were often asked to interpret book questions in R, which was a frustrating and timely exercise. ",
            "\u00a0Labs: should not be timed.  I wouldve learned more from labs, if I could have sat with them and worked on them at my own pace.  Or with a group.  And then come together for help from a TA.  Dont grade them if its too hard to sort out integrity.  Labs were my least favorite part of my semester at YSPH because they were so unnecessarily stressful.  Its weird to be tested on R content using multiple choice. \r\nExams: I did fine on them because I can memorize sentences from the book.  But that doesnt mean I understood it all.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for this course were overall a disgrace, with the exception of Savanah. They held office hours at inconvenient times, left their office hours early, couldnt speak English well enough to convey material, and expected us to know R with no introduction.  Other professors are crutched by a solid group of TAs...Mike didnt have that, and he was a new professor, so thats why there was so much angst.  Other classes have sections with TAs that ECHO course material that the professor teaches.  Dont get it with the professor? No big deal, you can learn it from your TA that week in an optional section.  But our TAs were too busy worrying about labs with us.\r\n\r\nProposal: \r\n-Labs happen, we get the lab ahead of time, and lab attendance is required.  Pass/Fail grading.\r\n-Hire two more TAs, that dont do labs.  They hold optional sections each week to go over lecture content.  Review sessions.  Like every other class here!\r\n-Keep exams focused on fundamental concepts and takeaways, not such granular details that I can memorize but dont even know what they mean. 4 exams is a good number.\r\n-Make all quizzes practice only. ",
            "\u00a0I think with it being a new course, there were some hiccups. I think it was too much content to be learning in one semester with trying to master the concepts and the R coding part of it too, especially for someone who had zero programming experience before. I think it was not set up in a way that fostered excelling for students-unless they had previous knowledge in biostats or programming. ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed very poorly and I did not enjoy taking it. Professor Wininger is a very nice guy but is very bad at teaching. I had to teach myself everything in this course, which took up a lot of outside of classroom time. ",
            "\u00a0I think a more thorough introduction to R would have been helpful. I feel that we were thrown into it during the labs and were not provided with a real introduction to the program. \r\nI had a major advantage having taken biostatistics before. I saw some of my peers struggling to understand biostatistics and R at the same time. It may be helpful to have some readings that are about R, or to use labs to go over any concerns we have with integrating the material and R. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good. The latter half was better and I will allow other students to share explicitly any changes needed as I was satisfied. ",
            "\u00a0MW is a great person and clearly very invested in us learning, but the lectures were very disorganized. He got better after the mid-semester feedback, but I still had a hard time seeing the point sometimes. I think the second module was particularly rough, and the third much better. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be relevant and important to the core curriculum but the delivery of this course was so problematic that I feel like that instead of learning the material, all I learnt was how the professor evaluates us and how to do well in his evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0Although the class covered the materials in all introductory Biostats classes, I felt that it was not very well structured. There were almost too many sources of information  lectures, quizzes, class notes, lab reports and as a student, it was hard to understand what was necessary to glean from all of this information. I would have preferred more example-based learning in class with R and less theory. I am shaky at math and so I really feel that examples in class would have been best. For example, Linda Niccolai's class cites theory and example within the same powerpoint and I feel like I've gained so much from her class because it was organized very clearly. With this class, it feels like it is two classes rolled into one with very little to tie them together (R and lecture). I really hope that the next person to teach this class has clearer power points/lecture slides, and spells out the important concepts rather than implying them and deferring to the book. The book is not easy to read nor is it intuitive. I think another text should be consulted in the future. ",
            "\u00a0There are too many materials in the course, some of them are repetitive and not very much helpful. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: The TFs were very helpful.\r\nweaknesses: The combination of R and biostats was hard to handle. More of the class should have been focused on R. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class, but it took me awhile to get there! Its the first year its being taught so I think a lot of the initial weaknesses can be attributed to the fact that the course was evolving and changing to become better. Overall, you really do come out with a good understanding of how to use R which is really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course felt disorganized overall. There were many working parts which did not fit together cohesively. The readings, lectures, homework, and labs felt unrelated at times. I think that the course should be restructured so that everything builds on itself. We were learning so many things at once and I think in learning details, the broader ideas and applications were lost. For example, learning when to apply a certain analytic method wasn't emphasized. I think that having practice with seeing different data sets and being asked how you should approach analysis would be useful. I think that needing to know mathematical details and specific R codes including arguments, etc. sometimes clouded the overall concepts. I felt as though I was trying to memorize details and equations instead of grasping the larger skills. I still do think that I gained a foundation in biostatistics and R, but the course was not as effective as I had hoped. I think that doing a lot of work outside of class and memorizing formulas, assumptions of tests, and specific R code was critical for success in the class because these details were tested. In my work going forward, I don't think these will be as much of an emphasis and I don't feel as confident in my ability to apply my skills in data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This course was more tricky than it should have been--preparing for exams felt like I was trying not to be outmaneuvered or confused by wording/phrasing which I think defeats the purpose of a stats class. In my opinion, the goal is to teach students how to conduct statistical analysis and how to understand which tests are appropriate in certain scenarios, but I felt like in this class I was constantly being tricked into giving the wrong answer even if I knew the topic and could apply it in a practical situation. ",
            "\u00a0strength: forced me to read the textbook\r\n\r\ncons: I learned the material by myself. The structure of the course wasn't optimized for meeting either goal: learning R and statistics ",
            "\u00a0Lot of reading and learning on own ",
            "\u00a0This course was a disaster. It was poorly organized and poorly executed. We were expected to to learn both R and biostats at the same time and it felt like 2 different classes for a majority of the semester. Neither of which I feel I have properly learned. Way too much was expected of us. 4 exams, 6 quizzes, and weekly labs. Really? Is ALL of that necessary? On top of that we would get \"optional\" homework in the textbook.  And then every time we were given an exam we were expected to have memorized exact phrases from the book, lecture, and R code. Totally inefficient form of evaluation. In what job will I EVER have to code by hand? That's not the nature of coding and not how you tell if someone understands coding. Also the format of every single exam was different. Mike changed it every time. I never knew how to study for this class. Sometimes he would say ignore the homework (after spending a month telling us to do it) then we had free responses thrown at us then matching questions. The really rich part about the matching was that this was Mike's excuse for putting in less free response. However, in the matching you can select from a word bank, but mike also said the right answer might not even be listed and we need to write it in. How is that any different than a free response? The quizzes were just excessive. The first half of the semester we had pop quizzes every week. I thought this was graduate school. Not some undergrad first year math class. Constant anxiety over these things I had to neglect all my other courses to constantly study for these. Also, why on earth would someone assigned a timed coding assignment? We didn't we have a week to do the code labs so I could actually process and learn on my own instead of just rushing to finish on time by blindly following what my TF said? That's not how to learn code.\r\nI was so looking forward to this class. I really wanted to learn stats. I've never taken a stats course before and needed this knowledge. However, I feel I haven't learned anything and waste time and a lot of money. ",
            "\u00a0I think that I am leaving this course with a solid understanding of statistics. I think that what we learned is very practical and will help me succeed in future public health courses. The weakness was mainly in the beginning part of the semester. I think it was very challenging to be learning the concepts of statistics in tandem with R. I think if we had more time to really understand the stats before beginning to use R, R would not have seemed as daunting. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this course was a big struggle. I felt that class lecture time was not used efficiently and that I had to teach myself the majority of the material. Specifically, I felt that sometimes the class got so conceptual that it failed to actually teach me how to use any tangible statistics skills. I was really hoping that I would leave with strong R skills, but the TF for lab did not offer support during lab sections and outside of a few lines of code here and there it was not discussed in class. It was frustrating to feel like I was constantly googling things or teaching myself from the book. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think the class was great. If you engaged with the work in a timely manner and were proactive in class and lab you were set up to be more than okay. My only issues came in two places. One, we weren't given the grade tresholds for certian disticntions, which made goal-orienting for the class impssible even after some grades had been given. Secondly, there was a negative echo chamber from other students who were not doing well that I think did a lot to take away from the istructor himself. He made himsefl wildly approachable, could speak to any topic, and is very kind. It was hard to learn when it seemed like he was backed into a corner by students, and I want to emphasize that I feel like this was due to no fault of his own. I am leaving the class feeling extremely well prepared to apply my skills in my professional life, and I think that is a wonderful feeling as well as outcome from the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course suffered from a lack of direction because it and the instructor were so new. I would have the lab assignments be longer-term assignments that we had 1-2 weeks to complete and then lab could be like a discussion where we review homework problems and ask questions about the the takehome R assignment. Tests I would want to have the same format each time. Online quizzes were fine. I liked that homework wasnt graded, maybe in discussion grade it for completeness vs correctness. ",
            "\u00a0This is the third statistics course I've taken at Yale, and it was easily the worst. Concepts were poorly explained in class, if at all. I understand that reading the textbook is an important part of any class -- it is a great tool. However, in this class, the textbook was the only way to learn. Many concepts were barely explained in class, if at all. IF they were explained, they were poorly explained, and they were often simply a copy and paste from the textbook. Class time did not add to my learning experience at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: A flexible instructor that wants the best for his students. That is it right there. If every class at Yale could have an instructor like Mike, I'd be beyond happy. He made the course. He made it approachable he made it doable and he made it fun. He took S&DS 103 and made it even better. This was my second stats course at Yale (after 103) and I am confident when I say I learned far more in this class than the other. Learning R was a HUGE benefit and I feel like I now have the basic skills in a language that I can build upon should I choose to. \r\n\r\nWeakness: It found its groove at the end. Any perceived weaknesses early on were adjusted and mitigated by course end. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed this course. The workload was fair, labs felt relevant to the lecture material (and vice-versa), and quizzes and exams were well-spaced. R was well integrated into the course and was taught as a tool not just for data analysis, but as a way to improve understanding of biostatistics. I've come away from the course feeling literate in biostats and prepared to use R in the \"real world.\" ",
            "\u00a0A lot of material was covered and I feel as if I have gained competency in both biostats and R. R came a little harder as we did not have as much formal instruction in it. I would recommend a separate R lecture or a discussion section just for R. Lab was overwhelming as I felt as if I had to learn on the fly and just get through the lab without much prior knowledge of the things lab was asking of us. ",
            "\u00a0The TA's need to be vetted before being assigned to teach. \r\n\r\nFurther, there should be some R prep materials given in the summer to incoming students. This would be very helpful. \r\n\r\nOverall assessment is that this is a good course, but it needs some renovations in regards to the quality of the TAs and initiatives on how to make R more accessible to the incoming students. ",
            "\u00a0It's difficult to combine R statistics with theoretical statistics so it might be better to offer them as separate classes. Adding a required discussion or having longer labs might be more useful than a long class period. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of R learning materials are provided which are very helpful, especially for new learners.\r\nOne suggestion is I think the exam could include R coding on computer. Actually, it's meaningless to exam the ability of writing R code by hand. In practice, when we make mistakes we can be alerted by the computer. Maybe take home exam is a proper way to check our R coding ability on computer. ",
            "\u00a0Course was disorganized. Mistakes in homework assignments and exams made learning more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult to critique a course that is under new instruction because the material was clearly newly developed as the course progressed. I think given the overhaul of the course, it was a fairly strong course. However, it was weak in the presentation of material, which lacked order and direction at the beginning of the semester. While this did get better of the course, I think it is imperative that the instructors consider adding a second lecture to teach R. I do not think it is effective to teach statistics and R in the same course lecture. A student needs to fully understand the statistical methods being applied by the R script and many students, I believe, were so focused on learning R that the statistical knowledge became secondary. Additionally, the course relied very heavily on the book, which is fine, however it would have been helpful for the instructor to synchronize the book with the lecture more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyed the lectures, especially at the beginning when it was more of a conversational setup. Appreciated the posted lecture notes and lab primers. I felt the quizzes and exams were fair and fairly graded. The only weakness of the course was the lab. I felt as though the actual lab assignments were very long, so the class relied on the TA to help guide us and we were not truly understanding why we were using the codes we were using for each step of the lab. For future, I would recommend an R primer be sent out either over the summer or during orientation so students who have never worked with R before have some exposure and familiarity before the first lab. Second, I would recommend that the actual lab assignments be made shorter so the class can submit the assignment early and then the TA can take 20-30 minutes explaining why particular codes were used for certain steps, so as to facilitate actual learning of R. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the content is very important and useful. Labs were fun and helpful to build coding skills in R. I enjoyed doing lab exercises and I actually felt like I got to apply my skills. Office hours were helpful, and I appreciate the Prof. Wininger was very willing to meet with students to check in with them or answer any concerns or questions they had about the material. Practice quizzes, study guides, and lab primers were helpful for students to study. Prof. Wininger is incredibly responsive and receptive to feedback. He changed his pedagogy throughout the semester to meet students where they were at. He genuinely cared about his students and wanted them to do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) This class lacked a lot of consistency in the beginning. The homework, lecture notes, labs, quizzes and exams were all in different platforms. Each and every single one of these had a different format, so students had to adjust their brains to each and every single of these formats (then, on the exams we were asked to code by hand, but throughout the semester we coded on our computer! These two formats were different). So, studying exams was difficult and overwhelming because the professor would test us on very, very minute details in the book (like a single line) or a code from some lab. BUT, all that said, exams 3 and 4 were much better in terms of directions to study as Prof. Wininger prepared for us the study guides, so we were able to narrow down the amount of material to focus on. But I wish there was more consistency - every time there was a change in the structure or pedagogy, people didnt know what else to expect. 2) I find professor Winingers lecturing style hard to follow if he wrote things on the iPad, and frankly, the classrooms setup wasnt super conducive. It was hard to stare at a small screen when the lecture notes were in font size 10-12. But things were much better when prof. Wininger explained things on the board using his marker! He did that during office hours and review sessions and it was massive improvement. 3) Although the class did better overall toward the end of the semester and prof. Wininger genuinely wanted us to do well, I felt that we were all caught up in the how-to-beat-the-test mentality rather than actually going to class to enjoy learning. In lectures, instead of going over the concepts from point A to point B, prof. Wininger would highlight stuff and tell us to know them because they will be tested on. I dont think that is helpful for us to learn because if we dont understand the material, it doesnt matter if well do well or not. It felt like we were instructed on how to beat the test than to understand the concepts thoroughly. 4) I didnt like how R skills were tested. I think it is quite ridiculous to ask students to code by hand on the exam, frankly because thats not how were going to do that in the real world. I dont think any employer would ask us to code by hand before hiring us. And a lot of the codes can be looked online. I think a final data analysis project would be a better way to test us on our R skills because wed get to actually code on our computers - which is what we actually do in the real world - while applying a lot of the concepts we learn in lectures. 5) I did not like how early the class was. It is hard for me to math that early in the morning ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaches you both statistics and ability to use R\r\nThe organization of how R was taught could be more succinct. The course just dove in to R without really going over the basics of what is what in the software itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It tries to teach a free analytical computer program.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is difficult to read if you don't have a strong math background, and the class in general feels like it's catered to biostats or stats students, which is unfortunate because very few of them take that class. It's also hard to evaluate the class because things kept changing all of the time, sometimes we would have a detailed lecture, sometimes it would just be chatting, sometimes the quizzes would test knowledge that was from the textbook and sometimes it would test us on things from the homework. This is especially upsetting because the homework was \"optional\"--direct statement from the Professor, but a vast majority of his lectures, tests, and quiz questions were based on the homework. We also rarely went over the homework, which made it even more difficult to comprehend. The course was also required us to complete an assignment in about an hour and a half, which was extremely difficult when your TF never explained what to do in the first place. We also only had exams, which isn't really conducive to testing us on our R capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0My overall assessment of the class is pretty poor. There were many weaknesses in combining biostatistics with R. Could be improved by offering a module over the summer and an extra hour of \"R discussion\" similar to how we have a discussion for Epidemiology. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was one of the worst experiences I have had in my academic courses. I do not believe it to be a representation of Mike's work with the class, but merely the setup and the lack of preparation for what this class really looks like. There should be a reevaluation of the textbook for this course, because it is not user-friendly, and doesn't address the use of R and the material successfully. There should really be powerpoint style slides, with the amount of theory and wordy rhetoric used throughout the chapters. As for the lab and the class improved after a lot of backlashes, communication with administration, etc. There were multiple situations where I referred to other university's biostats ppt slides, to teach myself the material, because we had no such resoures. It was too late for a lot of these students, including myself. The sole strength of the course was Mike's ability to respond to student's on a beyond timely fashion. But with that said, unless this course is changed completely and students are provided support prior to even walking into the class, I would not recommend this class to anyone, even though it is a core class. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Class time was used really poorly; grading was an absolute rollercoaster; homework was orders of magnitude more difficult than the exams, so actually doing it all was not time-efficient (I ended up just reading the answer keys to study).\r\n\r\nStrengths: I actually thought the labs were done pretty well. I liked the quizzes, since they forced me to keep up with the material, but maybe having them more consistently (i.e. weekly) would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Expectations for labs, quizzes, and exams were all extremely clear after adjustments were made mid-way through the semester. I was never taken by surprise by the structure of assignments or tests, which was a huge relief (especially compared to some other courses I took this semester). It made it a lot easier to study, and, more importantly, allowed me to understand how much time I needed to dedicate each week to ensure that I was fully grasping the material covered.\r\n-Mike was incredibly accessible. He went above and beyond to make sure students felt comfortable and his positive and encouraging messaging made a big difference for an otherwise challenging course.\r\n-Lab primers were enormously helpful.\r\n-Take home quizzes (as opposed to in class pop quizzes) were a much better way to test understanding of the material. If in-class quizzes are considered next semester, I think it would make more sense to notify students in advance so they could employ ample time to prepare.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Design and logistical structure of the course. This was addressed in a breakout session for constructive criticism in the course about halfway through the semester, but more specifically:\r\n1) There was a huge discrepancy between \"levels\" of my various classmates. If we all took a placement test prior to the start of the course, we could be grouped according to our previous exposure to the material (maybe by lab sections?). Ultimately this course would be better broken into sections based on previous stats/biostats experience, or as a individual statistics courses relevant to departments or professions corresponding to those departments. I'm not sure if this would go against accreditation standards, but it would be a more practical approach. \r\n2) Folded into this, the idea that we should be teaching one another in labs -- as opposed to the TFs -- was a huge problem. I was often distracted by other students who were struggling in labs if I felt like I understood the material and they needed help, or vice versa.\r\n3) Huge discrepancy between TFs and teaching styles. This was exacerbated by labs where (as mentioned above) students often found themselves teaching one another instead of the TFs doing so.\r\n3) No caps on lab sections, meaning some labs had upwards of 40 students, and others had half that. I was in a larger lab which made it nearly impossible for my TF to dedicate adequate attention to ensure that we were all learning and understanding the material (though she did her best!).\r\n4) Labs would have been better with additional time to understand and submit the material. If labs were used strictly to teach content and then students were allowed an additional 24 hours to complete the lab assignment, I know it would have made a huge difference for me. Sitting in a crowded lab setting with other stressed out students was not conducive to productivity. \r\n5) Volume of content was generally too high. Combining theory and R was too much at once, especially for those of us lacking a background in statistics.\r\n\r\nFor the class content, a few additional things:\r\n-Hand coding R on exams -- I didn't find this particularly practical as it's not how you would use R in the real world. \r\n-Little connection between theory learned in class and practical application in labs. I often felt as though every lab was like starting from scratch as opposed to building on material we learned in class or from previous lab sections.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n1) Provide a placement exam for incoming students next year.\r\n2) Split the course into two sections: one half of the semester an intensive focus on theory, the other on statistical software (or this could even be split into two semesters, though I suppose it would restrict electives for some departments).\r\n3) Uniform training of TFs.\r\n4) Caps on lab/section sizes. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great but there was to much material for students to go through. I understood it was from Mike's desire to provide us with as much as possible, but it became burdensome and not too conducive to learning the material. The textbook was excellent and served as a central resource when things got out of hand. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot. It was hard to learn R from scratch at the beginning which was discouraging but the lab primers later on in the semester helped a lot. It was difficult to have to translate R code for the test because that isn't how you figure out if the code is correct. Coding is interactive but the tests weren't. I thought the answer choices on tests were very difficult-a, b, a or b, and and b etc. \r\nStrengths-I feel like I learned a lot and it was useful. I can see the value in understanding conceptually a lot of what we learned in reading scientific papers etc. ",
            "\u00a0professor wininger really made an effort to listen to the concerns of the class and he addressed them accordingly. his passion for statistics is contagious and made the class even more enjoyable. he made the lectures understandable and was very open-minded. ",
            "\u00a0Having the outline of the lecture for the day was beneficial to takes notes during class. The tests and quizzes mainly follow the book which can be helpful because you mainly know what to look for but It can also take a few exams to figure how to study for the exam based on the types of questions asked. The beginning of the course was extremely confusing attempting to learn both statistics and R programming. For individuals completely new with R it would be beneficial at least for the first few lab periods to have to be taught R. The TF should lead a group discussion of how to solve the problem allowing students to answer it pieces together. ",
            "\u00a0Material tested did not align with material taught which made it difficult to study for tests. Material taught in class was significantly easier than what was tested on. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course content was reasonable. It was a typical intro stats course, plus learning a language. I think it often pandered too heavily to people who did not study well, and other times left prepared people behind. The mix of R and basic stats was a little clunky. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - good course content in regard to concepts covered, learning R is very practical and a good skill to have (lab sections facilitated all of this - taught by TFs)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - scattered course materials/too many course materials that were not concise, poor meshing of conceptual with R work, quiz questions often phrased in confusing ways that did not accurately test understanding ",

            "\u00a0This course presenting challenging concepts and topics and was structured in the best it could in order to try and teach the concepts it needed to. ",
            "\u00a0Good. We got to learn basic data science. However, it is mostly a conceptual level course, if students are looking for a course which can improve their problem solving skills, it may not be what they are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class SIGNIFICANTlY improved after the course recalibration after the 2nd exam. I think shifting the focus away from calculations and toward concepts and applications was very useful and made a lot more sense for this class. I also appreciated the addition of lab primers, class notes, and study guides to help students prepare before getting into classroom. I also think the grading structure was very generous and provided many opportunities for students to succeed, despite the course itself being challenging.\r\n\r\nThat said, this class was unnecessarily stressful in a lot of ways and could be improved for next year. First, providing students with an R \"crash course\" either before or during orientation would be incredible. I (and most of the class) entered the lab room on the first day with absolutely no coding background being told to \"figure it out.\" For someone who has never interacted with a coding platform before, this sink or swim mentality was unhelpful and did not facilitate learning in any way. I think providing a way to get comfortable with the software before working with it on a timed, graded assignment would be extremely helpful for students. Second, I would reduce the reliance on multiple choice questions that have \"both a and b\" and \"neither a nor b\" as possible answers. I think these kinds of exam questions confuse students more than tests their knowledge about certain concepts and leads to more frustration. Third, if possible (and I think this would be consistent with the course recalibration), I think it would be helpful for the instructor to provide more examples of how biostatistics is used in every discipline of public health rather than just Epi. Specifically, many health policy and health care management students are left wondering what the application of this material would be to their work, apart from understand basic interpretable concepts. Fourth (and I realize this was difficult to do because this was the first time the course was taught), it would be helpful to outline the expectations of the students at the very beginning of the course, specifically, what score is needed to pass. I think there was a lot of anxiety about this before Mike announced it 2/3 through the way through the semester. Fifth, TFs should be hired on their ability to teach labs as well as their knowledge of statistics. Some labs had a \"sink or swim\"/ \"teach yourselves and I'm here for questions\" mentality, and other labs provided more hands-on support. Unfortunately, students could not choose labs based on their learning style; we chose only based on compatibility of the lab section with our schedules. So, not everyone ended up in a lab that fit their learning style. I think having some uniformity about how labs are conducted would be helpful. Additionally, holding the lab sections in rooms that accommodate both the type of work (i.e. make sure there are enough tables), and the number of students would be helpful. Finally, I think the reliance on the book makes the class unnecessarily difficult. The book is very informative, but not always easy to understand for someone without an background in statistics. If the class is to follow the book exactly, I think the instructor should focus the class time on outlining expectations for understanding book material and explaining those concepts in terms other than what is stated exactly in the book to make sure students understand. Mike definitely did more of this as the semester went on, but generally, if the course is going to be book-heavy, the class time needs to focus more on explaining the book in a reasonable way. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution (though I'm not sure how feasible this is): Biostats is a very useful course, but applied very differently across disciplines. It may be beneficial to teach different courses specific to each discipline rather than having all 200 first years in the same room. This specific application might make the course more useful for students. ",
            "\u00a0Test questions were far too specific.  The test questions should reflect more real world Biostatistics problems.\r\nThere should've been lecture slides.  The lecture notes were too difficult to follow.\r\nSplit the semester in half and do Biostatistics theory learning for half and R for the other.  And give us more projects in R.\r\nGive us an R textbook. \r\n\r\nOverall, course was confusing to follow. ",
            "\u00a0This course went over a lot of relevant content and taught me skills that will be useful throughout my public health career. I think an R or stats bootcamp in the summer would have been helpful for those of us coming in with very little stats experience.  It would also have been nice to have the R learning be more take home project-based. Doing the R projects during lab was very stressful for people with little experience. ",
            "\u00a0-need standardized lab sections with TFs following the same teaching practices\r\n-need step by step instructions with R studio ",
            "\u00a0I believe it is well-documented that the course had a rough start, but I left the course with positive feelings. I feel I developed skills in Biostatistics that will be helpful to me in public health. ",
            "\u00a0This was single worst educational experience of my life. The course design was not conducive to learning. Rather, pure memorization was expected (like writing code by hand). I feel like I did not gain practical skills for using biostatistics. From the tests that contained erroneous material to the inconsistencies in what is expected to be known, this course was definitely the worst part of my semester. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness of the class was its design, which destined our instructor to be stretched too thin. The class design was to teach ALL levels of statistics knowledge and also pile on R, which felt excessive. At the beginning of the semester we took a skills assessment for the sake of Mike, but those assessments felt like they were never looked at again besides as a benchmark for progress. I feel those assessments should be used for placement into different stats courses to allow for the most amount of growth for each student. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the professor is really trying to help students to learn \r\nWeaknesses: the structure of this class is not well established. For example, evaluating students based on a weekly homework problem set probably will be more efficient than a weekly quiz. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting and rewarding course. It was also extremely difficult. I loved it though. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed disjointed. R programming seemed to be emphasized over actual statistics most of the time. It seemed like two separate courses. The instructor tried to remedy this in the second half off the course. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps have a discussion section similar to Foundations of EPI on fridays, and have 2 days worth of lab alternating with the MW course schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor was very dedicated and passionate about the course, interesting course material, exposure to both r and biostats was interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: lab was extremely variant in terms of quality and teaching based on teaching fellow, and learning both r and biostats at the same time was very overwhelming which was compounded by the fact that we were never really taught r (not in lab nor in lecture). Structure of the course was quite unorganized in the beginning of the course, but was improved by the professor in the latter half of the course (this improvement was very helpful- wish it could have been done earlier). Mistakes were often made in posted homeworks and grades (when I told the professor my grade was wrong he was quick to fix it, but of course it would be ideal if the mistake hadnt been made in the first place). ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely frustrating for many, including those that were very interested in the material. After each exam, the professor would change his teaching style, which is great in the sense of him being responsive to class feedback but extremely difficult for the students that were all attempting to navigate how to acclimate to him. I have always loved Statistics and was very excited to learn how to navigate a new language but I felt that most of the class I was attempting to learn how Dr. Wininger was going to test us on the material rather than actually learning the material that was presented. Additionally, it did not feel that the amount of work put into the class was rewarded in actual ability to answer questions that he wanted us to. In the end, much of the class had such a low moral concerning the course that we lost hope in being able to see the reward for our efforts. ",
            "\u00a0This was a frustrating course for me because I came into it with high expectations and very excited to lay a biostatistics foundation and learn R. I think the course in general was taught from a statistics perspective, and I think we could have benefitted from a more applied class with more connections to public health research and practice. ",
            "\u00a0It got much better towards the very end of the course.\r\n\r\nI wish we were taught the mechanics of the stats in class instead of spending more time on the more basic aspect of a concept. For example, instead of simply talking about how to run an anova, explaining more why you do it, why you type certain things in the code, and how it may be useful in a real-life application. \r\n\r\nI felt that the quizzes and exams earlier on were testing on very nitpicky details of the stats but not necessarily if we conceptually understand it and know some of the important aspects of it. There were questions on quizzes and exam that I felt were very minute and doesn't matter in the long run. \r\n\r\nI wish there was an R primer or something before the course started or more instruction as we eventually got in the course for the lab. R for most of us is a new language and trying to understand how to program on top of that was a steep learning curve. Along with the primers, it would be nice to know why we're doing certain things instead of being told that's how you run a certain line of code. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: use of R software, quizzes fairly straight forward \r\nWeakness: needs to be smaller, fairly weak/incompetent instructor and TA, unfairly administered exams, ",
            "\u00a0The course could have been much better with a supportive instructor and a more helpful teaching staff. The material was all very useful but it required a lot of independent learning. ",
            "\u00a0Lab is a critical component of the course, and I enjoyed learning R but would have enjoyed it more if the lab did not have a time limit to be due. We should have the whole week to work on it if the intent is truly to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0great! really learnt about the usage of R and stats. ",
            "\u00a0The workload for this class was outlandish, even for the average public health student who had background experience in the material, and in data analysis. I can't imagine how bad it would be for someone just entering the field. For comparison, I took a combined graduate level/ undergraduate level bio statistics course while I was an undergraduate (with grad students and undergrad students doing exactly the same work and material, minus the undergrads having a final exam and the grad students having a final project), and had to completely teach myself SAS for that previous course because it was assumed everyone already knew how to use it. I ended that previous class with a great grade, after putting in alot of work and teaching myself SAS. This current Yale class was MUCH more work, and my grades on exams were much worse in that class, despite presenting similar base knowledge. I do not feel comfortable using R at all ending this class. In fact, I think I would know how to use R better than I do now if I took all of the time I spent in this class and applied it toward learning R by myself. ",
            "\u00a0The course was designed to assess statistics and R skills but I dont feel that I learned significant R skills to apply outside of class. Also, I dont think we were given enough material to learn R outside of class. In regards to the statistics content taught in the class, it was more conceptual than any math class Ive ever taken and required more reading than I anticipated. If the goal of the class was to teach statistics concepts, then I think the course achieved that. But in terms of applying the concepts to math problems, there wasnt a lot of that. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the textbook provided a good introduction\r\nWeakness: the course was a little disorganized, concept materials should be taught clearer, and maybe learning SAS would be more helpful than R\r\nImporvements: doing more problems in class ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the grading scale for this course. The fact that quizzes and labs were 40% of our grade and each exam was worth 15% of our grade took the pressure off of exams. I really liked how Professor Wininger dropped three of our lowest lab grades and two of our lowest quiz grades. It is a difficult and stressful subject, but the grading scale was fair, and it decreased the amount of stress associated with the class. Moreover, I liked the textbook for this class. Its explanation of the statistical concepts were really helpful. I also liked how Professor Wininger provided us with a detailed study guide about what exactly is going to be on the exams. In addition, I liked the multiple choice portion of the exams, but I didn't like writing out code by hand. Another improvement I would suggest is going over the R material in more depth during the lectures. Many of us have never coded in R, so we were going into the labs with little to no foundation in coding, which made keeping up with the work difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the course really emphasize on R, and combine the practice with learnings. This is really great, and I feel I am not that afraid of R anymore.\r\nWeakness is, the examples of the book are great, but why we use some other examples that are more confusing in class? ",
            "\u00a0This remains controversial - I thought that the textbook provided was very useful, and easy to comprehend. Many of my colleagues however, thought that the textbook was dense and did not complement the course material. I would say that reading the textbook chapter before classes definitely helped understand the more conceptual course material. However, without reading the textbook, and relying solely on lecture slides, was a little confusing.\r\n\r\nThe course tried to balance between our comprehension of R software, conceptual biostatistics knowledge, and the application through labs. I thought this was good, but perhaps the course structure could be better.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lab section was often confusing and rushed. Since we were only given 1.5 hours to solve a short-to-long assignment set, during the first weeks, when most of the class had 0 R knowledge, we had to rely on the TFs to guide us through the session. In later weeks of the semester, if we were stuck on bugged code or forgot some concepts, we would run out of time to finish the assignment.\r\nI would suggest to reformat the Lab section into take-home assignments, so that students can have time to look at Stackoverflow, course content, etc. so that everyone can do it at their own pace. I think that this method would make the material stay longer in the students' brain too. ",
            "\u00a0This class wasnt my favorite statistics class I have taken. I felt as the material was all over the place especially when including r in the course outline. There really should have been separate class for r and this statistics class should have stuck to the foundations of statistics. I believe the lab should have furthered the material taught in class instead of solely focusing on r. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Adaptive teaching style, Covered important material\r\nWeakness: Incorporating R coding into exams. I felt our familiarity with R could have been better assessed in a lab/test environment. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I am incredibly disappointed in this course. I had (have?) no background in bio/statistics and was excited to learn and understand how to apply statistics to the work I have done, am doing, and will do. I got nothing but struggle and strife from this course. The material was dense and not presented well at all. Lectures were very scattered/aimless, homework was assigned without review or guidance, there was no connection between statistics and the R coding and programming.\r\n\r\nThe lectures and lab sections have nothing to do with each other - one did not help or even connect to the material in another (unlike my other classes). Using R in lab was stressful and disjointed. I wish there had been some sort of primer or review in the summer to have better prepared me. \r\n\r\nWe took a sort of diagnostic test at the beginning of the semester, presumably to gauge our skill level - but i dont know that anything came from that. It would have been nice to have sections for beginner/intertermediate/advanced - based on student experience and skill level. \r\n\r\nAfter talking to some of the AP students who took biostatistics in the summer, they did not have the same complaints /sentiment - wondering why admin/the department didn't just use the same Professor/design of that class instead of testing this out on us. I know i'm not alone in feeling this way. \r\n\r\nafter a semester of hard work, I don't understand biostatistics or statistics any better/at all. ",
            "\u00a0it's interesting material but the lectures were not conducive to learning - relied heavily on the book ",
            "\u00a0This was the most frustrating course I have ever taken. I felt like there was no way to learn the material because the instructor was ineffective, and with other classes, seminars, and a job it is impossible to spend hours and hours each week teaching yourself the material. First of all, the class was much too big to be able to effectively teach this subject. Some subjects are better suited to a lecture style and others are not suited to it at all. During the lecture, it was difficult to hear everything the professor said because the room was so long. The lecture notes were not helpful because they did not explain the material differently than the book had. Criticism about teaching style was met with defensiveness. People without math/science backgrounds were made to feel inadequate. We were promised the first day of class that we did not need to have any experience with R, but it was never taught well. In labs we were left to struggle through the material with minimal guidance. In other lab sections the TFs taught R code and guided students through the labs. Other TFs even provided review sessions for their sections! The instructor said that TFs could decide their own teaching style but clearly some students had an enormous advantage because they had helpful TFs. The room where our lab was held did not have adequate table space and when we brought this to the instructor's attention, he told us that he would see if we could switch rooms. Nothing happened and I though that there were no other available rooms. Then one day towards the end of the semester our TF didn't show up to lab so the instructor came. He claimed to be surprised by how bad our room was and that he had no idea of the issue. His office hours were held at a time when many students had lab for the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was a good overview of statistics. However, I feel as if it should have had more of an R focus or integration. It would be useful if one day of the week was used to review material from the book and explain concepts and the second day of the week was to go through a homework-like problem together/using R. I think that it would be a great class if it better integrated R into the statistical theory. As well, it would be nice to use math more rather than simply theory. In the end, the tests were good about setting up equations and applying the math. Overall, the greatest strength of the class was the number of resources that were available to the students and the fair testing on concepts. All information on tests stemmed from the lectures and homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good opportunity for R learning starters. With labs focusing on practicing data cleaning and data analysis, I was able to get a primary understanding of R coding. However, this course spent a lot of time drawing graph and some too basic concept like mean and median. The time arrangement could be better. ",
            "\u00a0By July and the timing of theoretical text book learning and practical R learning so that the learning curve for both components are equal and complementary. Otherwise, can be overwhelming, especially to beginners. \r\n\r\nCourse difficulty and demand is comparable \r\nto a non-math major pre-med math undergrad course at Dartmouth (my alma mater). \r\n\r\nTherefore, this biostat course is  very reasonable for an Ivy League graduate program in public health. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course but the workload was equivalent to that of at least 2 courses and not just one. There were too many assignments/activities required for completion in order to truly do well: 1) Reading of assigned material in the textbook, 2) Homework assignments, 3) Lab primers, 4) Labs in addition to quizzes and exams. It was overwhelming and I eventually gave up on trying to master the material. \r\n\r\nLab sessions were very stressful. The graded assignments were too long given the amount of time allotted for the session. It felt like a stressful race to figure out the material together with my classmates and not a truly relaxed and positive learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course has many ups and downs. I urge everyone to review the lecture notes from the first six weeks of class so it can be understood how little we were taught versus how we were expected to perform. I self taught myself everything for the first exam over the course of a week reverse engineering the homeworks because we were simply not taught anything that we were tested on outside of what was in the book. His notes were unorganized stream of consciousness and the r code we were given was just that- given, not explained or defined so we were scrambling to put together correct chains of code in lab to complete on time all while not really knowing what we were typing or the meaningfulness of our analysis, so we had not way to actually learn anything and take it forward. I managed to pull out an acceptable grade, but as the material got harder it became harder to self teach and I, like a majority of the class, faltered on the second exam and still do not understand why there was not a curve to make up for that speedbump in all of our grades, since a universal dip indicates a flaw in the professor and not the student. This is not to say I didn't have improving of my own to do, but I am saying that I was alone on that process and the professor did not adjust his teaching style once he was forced to. It was a helpful change. The structured notes allowed me to learn and build on existing knowledge and I did excellent on the third exam. However, this increase in detail of his lectures led the professor to choose increasingly obscure concepts to test us on.  He provided where we could find each and every answer, however sometimes we were supposed to have memorized a throwaway concept that he had written in the footnotes at the bottom of the page. Fair game is fair game, but I think the flaw here is that we were not tested on execution or understanding but on seemingly random parameters and rules to the math that are not important in true practice. ",
            "\u00a0Course was disjointed; lectures, homework, labs, and exams did not feel connected in terms of relevant material. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a struggle, to say the least. One strength is that the course introduces students to R and stats methods. However, having finished the course, I still do not feel fully confident in my ability to use R because codes were only briefly mentioned in class and tested out in labs. A module explaining how to use R would have been helpful, as I did not know how to even open a script or input code prior to my first lab. Additionally, labs were incredibly stressful given their time constraint, lack of structure, and general unfamiliarity with using R. There is a lot of room for improvement with this class going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoying the programming aspect of this course, but I wish the labs were available for a longer time period, or that we had a semester-long project. I felt that I was able to execute everything that was needed in labs, but hardly ever understood what we were doing until the very end of the lab because it was so fast-paced and frantic. I was in a section that was very full, and it was complete chaos. The class itself was also good and I learned a lot, although I thought it was my worst subject. "

Changing the structure of the class notes would be helpful because they are not in-depth enough with the textbook.

I wish that he would have taught actual statistics instead of going over his lecture notes and referring to page numbers during the class. He also spent way too much time talking about exams. One day I think we actually spent 30 minutes looking over two plots of test scores in comparison time we opened the psets all to make the point that our poorer test scores were our own fault. Honestly, if we did poorly on the test, then the teacher is probably someone at fault not just us. Also it's okay if you're students are mad at you; not everyone is going to like you. I didn't want to be babied when I got a bad test score, I can handle myself. ",

When he explained everything and run the class in a more flexible way, rather than strictly following notes.\r\nHe is really willing to hear to students, and that is extremely positive.\r\nHe answer all questions kindly and with patience.\r\nHe provided with extra lecture notes, primer for labs, and everything students asked to try to help us.\r\nHe really knows a lot about R and stat.

Being tasked to teach a course like biostatistics to a groups of people with WIDELY variable skill/familiarity with statistics and math in general is a big ask, and I think that he did a really amazing job with the resources he had and the length of the course. He adjusted his expectations/direction of the class according to student feedback and what he interpreted to be the  the purpose of the class. That is just one example of Mike being flexible, accommodating, and dedicated to the success of the students and this pilot course. Although I cannot speak to previous iterations of the course, I think that Mike did an amazing job at fielding all the questions/challenges/anxieties students had around the class. \r\n\r\nAll of this is NOT to say that he was a pushover or did not make the class challenging. I learned a lot through this course and the pace was, at times, very challenging. However, I think that it would be hard to be critical of Mike's contributions as a professor. His output of content for the course was much more than any other professor in the core curriculum between homework, answer keys, practice problems/quizzes, lecture notes, the coding diary, study guides, etc. He also doubled his office hours in the later portion of the course. Ultimately, I very much enjoyed the course and Mike as a professor/person. ",

I really appreciate how he took our feedback into consideration toward the beginning of the semester. ",

However, in the beginning of the semester he offered no real concrete help or assistance in changing his teaching styles when the majority of the class was evidently struggling with how he taught.  It took several stressful months for him to finally recognize that how he was teaching was not conducive to a positive learning environment.  Only then did he take real action to help and support us.  However, it was far too late into the semester and should have been done the second the majority were showing signs of struggling and were reaching out to him. ",

I appreciate how much individual attention he gave to students, even in a 200 person class. I think he genuinely tried hard so I dont want my frustrations about this class to be taken out on him personally. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this class was a mess, and I think Mikes lack of organization was the biggest downfall. The tests were all confusing, with a bunch mistakes on each one. Lectures were hard to follow ramblings. Why couldnt he just have slides like every other professor that summarize MAIN POINTS, not 11 pages of unreadable r code that you tell us to read later. He could still riff with an organized lecture, but if he had organized slides, I think it would challenge him to focus on the main point. I dont think this is all on him. This is a new course required for all if us- where is the biostats Dept? Why was he left to himself. Why as a new prof, were they not reviewing his teaching materials at all? ",

His knowledge of biostatistics and R influenced his teaching style and he was often too advanced and vague for the knowledge and lack of proficiency of the class.

I found him to be very very helpful one-on-one during office hours and attended his office hours regularly, which helped me but did require a lot of time outside of class and lab. At the outset of the class, I think he tried to be a fun and likable guy and often got walked all over with students complaining about almost anything. Toward the end of the semester, Professor Winninger seemed to find a rhythm that worked. Posting the R Diary and study guide for exam 3 and 4 was extremely helpful in tying together concepts and understanding important topic connections. \r\nOverall great guy, tough circumstances. ",

He went above and beyond to provide the class with resources to study with for quizzes and exams. His homework was always posted with the solutions in both R and manually. His passion for statistics shone through in his teaching and made the subject much more enjoyable.

I also appreciated his teaching style of writing as he talked....other professors have perfect slides that they read off of, and its really easy to zone out.  Mike is easier to follow.\r\n\r\nBetter clarity on what concepts are worthy of testing on, and a solid team of TAs (that Mike didnt have) would help tremendously.  I didnt always understand my other professors either, but there was a TA section I could attend to get that help, where TAs re-taught the material covered that week. Biostats is the only class that didnt have that, because we had to have lab.\r\n\r\nStressful class that I spent a lot of time on. ",

He added office hours. He did separate appointments. If you couldn't make it, he even offered to have meetings over Skype. He was great. ",

I also found his examination style to be confusing. It tested our memorization skills rather than our knowledge. Overall, for an entry level course, the professor had no idea on how to judge our capability as a group and had too many expectations. Had unrealistic goals from us and was very stubborn to change or receive feedback. I think he might be better suited for an advanced course instead of an entry level course. ",
            "\u00a0It was a joy taking Professor Wininger's class. Although the material was challenging, he was readily available to answer questions and always had a positive and encouraging attitude in class. Being that this was the year this course was being taught in this fashion, Professor  Wininger frequently asked for student feedback and modified the course accordingly as the semester progressed. He provided us with plenty of materials to assist our learning--he posted lecture notes before each lecture and edited powerpoint slides after each lecture, he supplied us with lab primers to walk us through our labs and practice quizzes. In response to student feedback, he also began providing us with study guides before our exams. \r\nProfessor Wininger approachable and tried as hard as possible to communicate difficult concepts. ",

I really wish he had been clearer in the organization of the class. The lectures were not as informative as I would have liked (and the book wasn't much help patching together what was an important concept and what was fluff).

I think he could be more organized with his lectures and notes (once he began posting notes online I found this much more helpful) and I think he words his test questions in deliberately tricky ways which makes it hard for students to feel confident that they have the skills to conduct statistical analysis. In that sense, I think he may be accidentally undermining the overall goal of teaching students, because the tricky test questions make it feel as though biostats, which should be a straightfoward skills-acquisition course, is something that you cannot prepare for.

            "\u00a0Mike seemed to put significant effort forth, took the feedback students gave him, and attempted to make adjustments. He deserves credit for that because not a lot of professors do that. However, I felt that lectures were incredibly unhelpful. Mike's writing on the ipad is not legible a good amount of the time and he speeds through material. He puts written notes on the screen but they are so small that I can't even read them unless im sitting in the very front, which is obviously not feasible for every student. Mike would take every single useless, nitty gritty question from students in the front who never raised their hand and waste an enormous amount of time. Then he would realize he was short on time and speed through material, resulting in me not understanding it. Also, Mike frequently goes on tangents about the history of stats or how we can now code this or that or how we can make publication worthy graphs. He would just talk at us about all the skills we supposedly now have while spending less time actually teaching us these skills. I'm pretty sure he said \"you can make publication worthy graphs and figures\" at least once per lecture for the last month and half of class. Additionally, he would waste time by saying \"you don't need to know this equation\" then proceeded to go through every single part of it, then quizzing us on it. What's the point? Waste of time. I think Mike has a hard time making the information accessible to those of us with no stats background, like me. Overall, just really useless lectures. I wanted to skip but I had to keep showing up in case of a surprise extra credit quiz or something. I'm not paying $44,000 to receive an education this poor and wasteful. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Wininger is an outstanding educator. He is so empathic to the student experience and really tries to create a classroom environment that supports learning and curiosity, but yet is still challenging. It is clear that he invests a lot of time into helping his students succeed. Where he struggled was mainly finding the right proxy to assess student's mastery of course material. It took two examinations before I think he really found his stride in creating exam material. ",
            "\u00a0As a person I really enjoyed Mike. He has a great sense of humor and a true genuine desire to see us succeed in statistics. As I stated before, I think some of the problems were less with him as a person and more with the way the class and teaching were structured. I think having more structured and concrete skill teaching would be ideal, with less time vaguely talking about concepts. I had a serious problem with the format of the second exam. He is aware that many students were upset. He came in with only 10 minutes left on the exam to my room, spoke for 5 minutes and changed 3-4 questions. When he finished we had about 6 minutes left. I raised my hand and asked if we would be getting a few extra minutes since he had just taken up time and we would now have to go back to double check questions with changes- even if the correct answer is not changed we still had to go back and take time to check. He responded in a fairly rude tone that I \"simply had to take what I know and do it faster.\" I found this extremely unfair and that was the point that I started really disliking that class. He says that he wants us to succeed yet his practice does not match up with the way that he formats class or exams. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wininger is one of the best professors I have had in a long time. Although it seems some people had a rocky time in the course, I think it is wrong to say that as a comment on his teaching. He gave us all of the resources we needed to shine (e.g. met with us on weekends to do reviews for tests), was super available, and could always make you smile. He challenged us in a way that would force us to truly learn the material, and that should be appreciated. I think he is a bright young talent, a wonderful human, and nothing but an asset for YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wininger was super responsive to student concerns which I greatly appreciated. The course was a mess in the beginning but I feel it greatly improved when Professor Wininger changed his teaching format and focused the lectures. My only comment is that addressing student concerns could take up a lot of classtime, and I would want the professor to be aware of that next time. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wininger was a really nice and enjoyable person, but his teaching was subpar. He did not add any knowledge not provided by the textbook. He didn't even provide another way of conceptualizing things. He often went on tangents in class, and we rarely covered all of the material we needed to know. He was very invested in the class, and he clearly wanted to improve and be the best teacher possible, but his intentions simply didn't translate into actions. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing. He should be in the hall of fame for instructors. Now I don't really find statistics that interesting. Nor do I think I will go into the field much further. But I would not hesitate in placing EPH505 in the top 5 classes I have taken in 7 semesters at Yale. He is absolutely caring and wants the best for his students. I think he left it all on the field. He poured so much passion into making sure we could succeed. I really felt like the quality of my other courses were not as good compared to EPH505, just because of Mike. Should he ever wish to pick up the teaching torch again (which, Mike, you should definitely take a break after such an intense semester) but, should he-- I think he would be even better. He does something that most professors never do, change. He was willing to make changes to the way he was instructing that allowed for us to learn better. God good, I know this sounds like some love letter but I will miss Mike. He cared. It is as simple as that. It makes me sad other professors don't seem to have that quality about them. ",
            "\u00a0Mike's enthusiasm for biostatistics and genuine care for students' learning (and well-being!) really drove this course. Mike listened to students' concerns and made adjustments to his teaching style when necessary. He provided ample materials to enhance learning (study guides, homework, detailed lecture notes, annotated slides, and bonus points). Every adjustment Mike made to the course structure was clearly out of concern for our learning. Sometimes these adjustments felt as though they were catered to a vocal minority of highly dissatisfied students, and I do wish that Mike sought more student input before switching to the pre-written lecture notes (as these were very small on the screen!), but generally every change was intentional and enhanced the course. \r\n\r\nI sometimes had a hard time knowing what to study for exams since lectures didn't feel super structured (and we had so many sources of information, from the book to homeworks to lecture to labs). However, by the end of the semester Mike was much more clear about how to prepare for his exams. \r\n\r\nAnother point of feedback is that it would have been nice to know the Honors/HP/P cutoff before going into the final exam. \r\n\r\nIn general, I am truly grateful to have taken this course with Mike. His sense of humor, willingness to make adjustments given student feedback, and teaching of very tangible stats/R skills made this course so much more enjoyable! ",

I took an introductory stats class twice in undergrad, and this is the first time where I actually felt I learned anything. Mike is so enthusiastic about the subject that he makes it interesting to learn. I went into the class thinking I would hate it, but his instruction in the class made me really enjoy learning biostats. I am so appreciative of him as an instructor. He was so accessible and helpful. My favorite professor by far this semester. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Wininger is very patient and always encourage students on classes. One weakness is that the courses are too briefly, especially on Module 3 and Module 4. The course can just cover very few knowledge of each chapter. However, those uncovered knowledge still will be tested. In this way, we need to spend plenty of time outside the classroom. ",

Really enjoyed taking this course with him! ",
            "\u00a0Mike is very, very responsive and genuinely cares about his students. He made the class enjoyable and filled with positivity despite a lot of the challenges in terms of his teaching and the course structure. I really didnt like his lecturing style on the iPad. He was much better when he wrote things in the board during office hours, and I thought he could incorporate that more in lectures (sadly, the classrooms setup wasnt super conducive for that). He was very helpful during a review session in Winslow when he wrote things on the board So, having a lecture hall with a big black board would be a better setup than having computer screens projecting small size words. I can see that Mike really cared about us and that he was willing to improve his teaching, but I think he focused too much on how to beat the test than actually being more thorough and concrete in his teaching. Like, he would highlight what to know and what not to know for the exams in lectures instead of really teaching us the concepts in a logical manner. Lectures felt very random and disconnected because he wasnt really helping us connect the dots - he focused a lot on what to know and what not to know for the exams. I thought he was very helpful when he went over an example question in class step by step on how to do hypothesis testing. THAT was helpful because we were taught how to get from point A to point B, instead of being informed on whats going to be on the test. ",

Willing to work with student schedules\r\nWeakness: Defensive when taking constructive criticisms from students, makes fun of \"poetry majors\"--which really just exacerbates the existing tension between hard sciences and humanities which is unnecessary in an industry that must be comprehensive and people-oriented, will email a student who complains that they \"only looked at the exam study guide the saturday before the exam\" which just shuts down those complaints, has a lot of unguided lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think Dr. Wininger had the best intentions for the class but I do not believe he was meant to be an instructor for such a large scale class. I think for a lot of the semester he did not understand the pass/fail system of the class, as well as the concept that this was a BASIC biostats class. I think some of the biggest frustrations a lot of us had were that we would never get the step by step process of learning the formulas or theories, but would be tested in a very computerized, theory-based way. It was common that he showed us Step A and then Step C, assuming we knew what happened in Step B. There were multiple situations like this that left so many of us confused. He is a nice man and I do believe him to be so intelligent, however, teaching such a large class, basic information was not his strong suit. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Wininger did an excellent job of incorporating student feedback throughout the semester. When students found themselves confused during labs, he created a lab primer; when students wanted extra practice questions, he developed practice quizzes. He improved his teaching throughout the semester and was extremely receptive to any feedback, which is an awesome quality for any professor. ",
            "\u00a0Overally, it was clear that Prof. Wininger cared about our performance, had a well-thought-out plan for teaching us, and was always very responsive to feedback. Any issues with him, I believe, are more because it is his first year teaching a course and it is a huge class; they are definitely fixable and he has a great attitude to fix them. One specific improvement I would suggest is better use of class time. He clearly worked to correct poor use of class time by presenting outlines of each lecture and limiting digressions, but neither of these really helped. First, providing an outline of a lecture that doesn't introduce concepts in any order that makes sense is still very confusing. Second, he would focus on the boring or obvious aspects of each thing, making it 15-20 minutes between when anything important was said, and I honestly stopped paying attention. Finally, while the whole iPad/multiple screens thing is cool and flashy, using a stylus on an iPad made the class notes really hard to read and organize on the screen, making everything more confusing. Plus, it was hard to take handwritten notes in class since he was constantly writing and deleting things and they weren't included in the uploaded powerpoint. ",
            "\u00a0As I mentioned in the general course assessment, Mike was incredibly accessible. He went above and beyond to make sure students felt comfortable and his positive and encouraging messaging made a huge difference for a very challenging course.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, his office hours and setting up additional review sessions outside of office hours were particularly helpful. His teaching in smaller settings was more productive than in the large lecture (which I think is more a reflection of the material itself, not him as an instructor -- I don't think this course should be taught in a lecture setting). ",
            "\u00a0He was absolutely delightful. I think other students gave him really harsh feedback throughout the semester more because of their anxiety about grades, and less about his teaching. I do agree he sometimes gets too advanced for an intro class, but he has always delivered, whether through immediate responses to questions or additional notes. I saw many of his uploads time marked at 3 or 4am, which indicates how much he goes above and beyond for the class. I highly recommend him for an advanced biostatistics course. ",
            "\u00a0I though Mike was fantastic and very adaptable to feedback. Every time I sent him an email he responded promptly and took a great deal of time and pride in getting to know his students. Biostats is inherently challenging, especially on a Monday at 8:30 in the morning, but he made coming to class worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0professor wininger is extremely kind and was very receptive to critcism throughout the course. he acknowledged his weaknesses like the typos on the homeworks and exams and he worked hard to implement change for this. overall, his strengths greatly outnumber the weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0At the beginning of the course, Professor Wininger taught step by step from the ground up, told anecdotal stories to help with understanding the concepts, and entertained questions along the way. He was thorough and deliberate and the course, that was new to many students, felt like it was going at a good pace. This lasted until about the first exam, whereafter people complained about different aspects of the course and the professor completely changed his teaching style. Notes consisted of page numbers from the book instead of teaching the concepts outright. The labs were only possible with the help of the TF. Too many materials were posted to canvas that were seen as vital to the understanding of the course. The professor stopped actually teaching in my opinion. ",

            "\u00a0Enthusiastic and caring instructor. The problems with the course were not due to him being a bad teacher but rather from the broad course structure. He worked individually with me every time I had a problem and was valuable for supporting my mental health. Thanks mike! ",

People struggled with this class and Mike did literally everything in his power to help. To be quite honest, I think the people who were upset with this class were upset from their performance. As a student who struggled a lot on a few of the exams I genuinely believe that Mike was nothing short of fair, and perhaps was too generous, in his preparation and testing of the material. ",

In my opinion, most of the complaints against Mike overshadow genuine critiques that could help him be a better instructor. For example, I think at the beginning of the semester his examples were too high up for us to understand. As the semester progressed, his examples made more and more sense and were more explanatory. My hypothesis for this is because Mike is so advanced in his statistics knowledge, it's probably less simple for him to explain basic statistics to a class of people who don't know much. This critique is not a big deal or a character assessment of what Mike is capable of -- it's just a small critique.

It is a shame that this professor was unable to teach coherently, because I am sure that he has a lot of knowledge that he could share if he was a better instructor. Some of his weakness are that he seems to have difficulty empathizing with students that are not looking to be statisticians, and that he blamed the students for their inability to learn, rather than being introspective about his teaching abilities and style. His strengths were that he was willing to reach out to students individually if they were failing or falling behind, but if he had the ability to teach well to the majority of his students, this singular kindness would not have been necessary. Many students who stopped attending class started doing better on exams and felt like they understood the material better than when they had been attending class, which is really sad. We deserve to be taught something in a course when we are paying to receive a Yale degree. It is ridiculous that I had to teach myself the entirety of a class when a professor was being paid to teach and not doing so. ",

I had a particular problem where I was given a failing grade on a lab I thought I did well in. When I forwarded the issue to him, Dr. Wininger was great about staying up late on a weekend to go over my work and get me a response. The problem was that instead of telling me where I went wrong, he, in so many words, told me I was gravely behind my peers, that I showed several red flags and lack of understanding, and several other personal notes and assumptions about my performance as opposed to telling me where I went wrong. When I reviewed with my TF it turns out my code was off because of a simple typo. And yet, unprompted, Dr. Wininger continued to contact me for weeks with comments and unkind references to my shortcomings, I believe in an attempt to gaslight me and make me feel as though I was less intelligent than I was to avoid responsibility for his poor grading practice. Either way, his policy is valid, but he did not need to defend himself and his TA through devaluing me. Because of this experience I avoided him and avoided reaching out for help out of fear of being insulted again. His kneejerk reaction to our poor performance on the second exam, where he instead posted all of our canvas data on when we accessed the data as an explanation for poor performance, seemed also to avoid responsibility. What I can praise are the changes he made the levels to which he made himself available for reviews and office hours for the next exam so we could all improve. His teaching and attitude greatly improved and we all really appreciated it, however it was not enough to save the class. ",

However, I don't think he fully realized that all students had varying familiarity with statistics and experiencing in using R. He clearly put a lot of time and effort into designing the course schedule, labs, and homeworks, but it was all overlooked and underappreciated because a foundation of understanding in using R was not really built in this class. Codes were mentioned very briefly in class and sometimes tested out in labs, but it generally felt as though I still didn't understand the basic language of R and what I was doing most of the time. He did, however, do a decent job of teaching the stats material (items from the textbook). ",

This class took away from my performance in more important classes and in the end I only came out knowing what I could teach myself from a book. ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if it is absolutely required for a student. Dr. Wininger is potentially a great instructor and knowing to how to use R is a valuable skill - but this class was a mess. "
