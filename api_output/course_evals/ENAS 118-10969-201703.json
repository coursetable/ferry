            "\u00a0ENAS 118 teaches principles and basic theory of multiple engineering disciplines. I learned coding and basic skills necessary for designing and building things, including woodwork, laser cutting, SolidWorks modeling, 3D printing, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot of hands-on engineering skills and teamwork skills. ",
            "\u00a0I now have a more precise idea of what different kinds of engineering mean and have developed an interest for, and significant skills in, electrical engineering/computer science, something I had no prior experience with. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very useful in developing an engineering mindset. I was able to pick up several useful and practical engineering skills through the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about computer science, engineering, and how to create in this course. I began to feel more comfortable coding through the assignments that we worked on, I began to think more technically and specifically about what it means to be an engineer. And most importantly, for the first real time, I felt empowered to create with very basic materials--like wood, metal, pvc, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various engineering disciplines, developed my teamwork skills, and became acquainted with the CEID software, equipment, & machinery. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a large variety of technical skills. We learnt woodshop skills such as sawing and drilling, and machine shop skills such as cutting metal and laser cutting. I also learnt how to code on the Processing software, use the Arduino breadboard and SolidWorks, a CAD software. In addition to this, we learnt about how the different fields in engineering intersect with each other and what goes into the process of creating a product. ",
            "\u00a0Prior to coming to Yale, I did not have any previous knowledge of how to use any of the equipment in the CEID. I also did not have any previous hands-on experience in an engineering and design based setting, and this class allowed me to develop both my technical skills in using the equipment in the CEID and gain practical experience with a variety of engineering concepts and their applications. ",
            "\u00a0My greatest takeaways are the design process, utilizing the opportunities at the CEID, using the laser cutter, and working with Arduinos. ",
            "\u00a0The course really does teach you the basics of the different types of engineeri'g. The more important part for me though as Stuart the course got me excited about studying engineering and confirmed to myself hat I wanted to study mechanical  engineering going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about each engineering field and how to use almost all of the main tools in the CEID which was great. I learned team building and how to finish everything to the end. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in all of the engineering disciplines and some in computer science. I learned how to work with a client and a group to make a long term project come together in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I had very little science background before taking ENAS 118, so I learned a ton of skills in the course. Not only about laws of physics, how gears work, how to laser cut, etc. (though those skills proved very valuable), but also how to problem solve like an engineer, how to stick to a time table, and how to better work with a group to accomplish a goal.

            "\u00a0The one caveat to this class is the amount of time spent on the final project outside regular class hours. However, the majority of students enjoy their final projects and don't mind working towards their final goal.\r\nDean Vince and Larry make an excellent teaching team and do an excellent job introducing students to the principles of engineering. I absolutely loved this class! ",
            "\u00a0Its a very fun and low-stress, high engagement class, but the engineering lectures were not very in depth (to be expected for an introduction/survey class I guess) and the class is more valuable for the way it teaches you to think than the information given in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the course was designed. We were able to cover many topics and fields in a short period of time. I especially liked the final project, as it served as the accumulation of all the skills learned through the entire semester in a team-based setting. ",
            "\u00a0I have highlighted the strengths of the course in the other questions. The only problem that I had with the course was during the final project. It seemed like the three voices of authority--our tf, Dean Vince, and Professor Wilen--were rarely ever on the same page. This fact made it especially difficult for our group to know what we should be doing and how we should be doing it; we would be getting three different inputs that conflicted with one another throughout our project. I think that this problem could be remedied by more communication between the three authorities, or perhaps a work journal by the group to document what each authority said and their expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is project-based, it's not necessary to take notes, and there are no traditional exams. Most of the projects are fun, and the course provides students with a qualitative understanding of the various engineering disciplines as well as acquaints them with the CEID software, equipment, & machinery. Finally, Prof. Wilen is particularly accessible, and both professors are great people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course starts very early, and attendance counts toward the grade. The topics are somewhat rushed, coding is over-emphasized, and students are not provided with much of a quantitative understanding of the material; for example, stoichiometry is never covered despite the course description. Documentation is also over-emphasized. Some of the labs were the same as the CEID Wednesday Workshops, so some students had to complete activities twice. The projects are very time-consuming, and students are required to stay for the duration of the two-hour lab section even if they finish early. Supervision is required to work in the machine shop. With regard to the final project, the client meetings are too frequent after the first few, and the clients sometimes asked for too much and failed to deliver promised items to the CEID. The teaching fellow did not sufficiently recognize the time and effort invested by the team on the final project. Lastly, the TF and each professor repeatedly gave conflicting instructions, so at least one of them would get heated when the team took another's advice.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by addressing the weaknesses outlined above. ",
            "\u00a0The interactive nature of the course is amazing - it allowed me to have hands-on experience, rather than just sitting in lectures. Working in a team on a project to meet a deadline was also a very great experience because I was able to learn a wide variety of real life skills alongside engineering-application skills in a setting that was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It is unfortunate that we do not have more time in this class, because everything seems to be just barely touched upon before we move on. However, I think I learned an incredible amount of hands-on skills in a short time, for which I am very grateful. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed that the class was project based because I think hands on learning is very effective but often overlooked. ",
            "\u00a0We do a lot of code which is good but I didnt realize how heavily code would be involved and they taught code very quickly which was challenging for someone who had never learned code before. This however was a great learning process and I liked how we did a little bit of engineering from each department. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is good at going over all the disciplines of engineering and applying them, and also getting great projects for us to work on. A weakness is just some of the homework in canvas was a little unclear ",
            "\u00a0This class was absolutely awesome. I especially loved how hands-on it was, because that's not typical of an intro engineering course. After taking ENAS 118, I want to take the medical device engineering class and learn more about coding (and I'm a history major). "

            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this class enough!\r\nIt is a fantastic class for any student: it helps prospective engineers experience different fields and helps narrow which type of engineering they want to explore further; it is an extremely fun application class for current engineers; and it makes for an enjoyable foray into engineering for non-STEM students.\r\nIt was my favorite class this semester! ",
            "\u00a0I would fully recommend this course; it's incredibly fun and the instructors, Dean Vince and Larry, are both fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was super fun and engaging although a lot of work at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would, I managed to learn a lot. I did find myself working sometimes over ten hours per day on my engineering project, but it was so interesting that it wasn't nearly as painful as it sounds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is considering engineering. ENAS 118 solidified my choice of entering the tech industry. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course was actually recommended to me by another student--and I'm so glad that he did. It really provides a thorough introduction into engineering and the engineering resources and options at Yale. I am also very glad I was introduced to the CEID so early, because I have frequented it outside of my class and fully intend on continuing to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to prospective engineers because the qualitative understanding of the various engineering disciplines that is provided helps inform students about their major & career options. Furthermore, the final project is a great way to learn about the engineering process. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a comprehensive overall introduction to engineering, this is definitely the course for you. By the end of it, you should have a pretty good idea about whether engineering is the right choice for you or not. However, bear in mind that this course is a lot more work than it seems like. It requires hard work and a lot of time physically spent at the CEID. That being said, it is also very fulfilling to see what you have created. The course has no written exams, only hands on projects. If you are willing to put in the work, you will learn some incredibly cool things and definitely feel satisfied at the end of it. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely (and have already) recommend this course! You receive a great introduction to the types of engineering offered at Yale, and have the chance to be very hands-on at the CEID when working on labs and the final project. While definitely demanding, I found the final project to be very rewarding because you actually construct a solution for a real client. Definitely learned a lot about the design, prototyping and testing process! The course made me want to consider majoring in engineering - something Ive never thought of before. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. This course was by far my favorite course that I took my first year. Both Dean Vince and Professor Wilen are amazing professors and mentors, and you learn a great deal through the lessons, hands-on labs, and of course the final team-based project. It is a really wonderful opportunity and I recommend that every prospective engineering student (or any student - we had a few non-engineering majors in our class) take this course because you learn SO much in such a fun way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in engineering, perhaps unsure of what type they are most interested in, and students who are willing to work hard in groupwork. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is great for someone who is unsure of if they want to pursue engineering. And even if they don't want to go into engineering, this course teaches great and useful practical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because it was my most fun class this semester and it felt productive. However, if you take this course you need to be ready to put in a lot of time and work at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was very fun and you learn a lot it seems kind of easy at first but the projects are really fun and its a real world situation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you want a hands on experience and aren't sure what engineering you want to pursue. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend this class to a student interested in the humanities as well as a student interested in STEM. Everything you need to know, you learn in class, and office hours are such that any time you don't understand something, you can go to the CEID and get help from a Professor, TA, or CEID staff member. Plus, it's fun to hang around the CEID and see what the engineers on campus are up to. ",
            "\u00a010/10 would recommend! Great professors, really engaging class!!! "
