            "\u00a0The class is very fair, but it can be rather difficult. It feels hard to prepare for things as most of the material we can do is in class. Other than that, the class is great and very educational. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging; involves singing; keyboard lab\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could provide more paper material to aid students with learning material ",

            "\u00a0Yes, the class is very beneficial to musicians and non-musicians alike. ",
            "\u00a0If a student is interested in gaining a better ear and learning basic but essential musical tools, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A great way to improve musicianship. You can go as in depth as you want but you can also just do what is required of you and still get something out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, your ear will improve and you will have a new perspective on pop music and classical music. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but with the caveat that the amount of time I put into this course, and keyboard lab specifically, was at least equal to the time I spent on my other full-credit classes. I came out of the class with a much better understanding of functional harmony, better sight singing skills, and an improved ear, so Id say that the class did its job. I took this class after having placed into 110 on the music theory track - because of this, the challenge of the course was likely greater than it wouldve been for someone with a stronger music theory background.
