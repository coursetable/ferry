            "\u00a0Korean history from 1800s to now, concept of everyday history, finding insightful historical sources. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a great overview of Korean modern history, and it was a great addition to the course offerings at Yale which typically touches upon cultural or art history when they even discuss Korean history to begin with. The course had a particular focus on microhistory, which was an interesting take that provided some fascinating insight on Korean history. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of modern Korean history (broadly speaking) as well as a historiographical sense of what it means to write the history of \"everyday life.\" ",
            "\u00a0Not only did this class give an in-depth look at modern Korean history from the bottom-up, but gave the constant reminder to look at history from multiple angles- not just the official one of the elites. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a relatively in-depth understanding of a wide-range of time in modern Korean history. I learned how to read a large collection of readings on a weekly basis and discuss them in an intellectual setting with peers. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me both a solid understanding of the basics of Korean history beginning in around 1850 and a fairly deep dive into specific topics in Korean history. It also gave me an understanding of the advantages and difficulties in studying everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion and articulating my opinion.  I loved class discussion. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quality of the discussion\r\nWeaknesses: The number of readings could be reduced to ensure more in-depth discussions on them during class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stephens had a great selection of topics for the course, and the course structure was well-organized to ensure that students both got the facts straight while had the chance to engage with the topic critically. The microhistoy aspect was also very interesting, and I think it helped look past the typical narrative on Korean history.\r\nThe assignments turned out to be really difficult though, because of their focus on microhistory and change over time. I felt that I didnt have the space to properly address the nuance of the topic at hand with the given page limit, or did not have enough sources available to delve into the everyday aspect the assgnment asked for. I also wished we had more time to discuss the readings since they were really interesting and I thought we were sometimes rushing through them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1) The focus on everyday life  it's so important that Yale continues to offer history courses like this!\r\n2) Professor Stephens' incisiveness and charm. Being in seminar was both illuminating and thoroughly enjoyable.\r\n3) The ability of Professor Stephens to maintain a congenial seminar culture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) I think the expectations for the presentation and the topic review essay could be clarified, if only to reduce student anxiety.\r\n2) I noticed that we began discussing our ideas for the final paper quite a bit later than most history seminars do. I'm not sure whether this was intentional, but moving up the first deadline  perhaps making students submit a rough sketch of a topic a month or so into the semester  might, likewise, reduce student anxiety. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall the course gave a firm understanding of historical lenses to study from. The amount of reading was kind of staggering. While I understand it was a seminar, the amount of reading was still much more than other seminars I have taken and seemed more comparable to what I hear a senior seminar looks like if anything. While all the readings were informative and gave insight to the topic/theme of the week, the quantity did not really allow for in-depth, quality analysis since many of us tried to just get through the readings to begin with. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was its readings. I thought the readings were informative and exciting, and taught me a lot about Korea themselves. \r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this course was that class discussion often lacked opinion and differing arguments that could interact with each other. Often the professor asked for, in discussion, regurgitating fact from the reading as opposed to actually having opinionated discussions about it. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Professor Stephens did a great job of making the class accessible to people with no background in Korean history but also making sure that we were able to do deep dives into topics beyond the general chronology of Korean history. I think the readings were well chosen, and while they sometimes felt heavy, that were never unreasonable for a seminar. I would have preferred if the readings for any given week would have connected a little bit better to what we were reading about in the Robinson text, but overall I think it was quite good. \r\nI think the presentations are a good idea, and a good chance for us to get the gist of a reading without us all having to do it, but when there are multiple presentations in each class they get increasingly hard to focus on. I also think that we had to choose the reading for our presentation and the week for our topic review papers a little too early. I know it's important to get them started as soon as possible, but I think that quite a few of us were really not prepared to choose and still pretty confused. Maybe choosing them a week later or spending a little bit more time explaining exactly what your expectations are for each would be beneficial.\r\nLastly, a lot of the questions I posed in the reading responses were things that I was genuinely curious about, and having a response to those and a response to any analysis would have been good. I think maybe setting an earlier deadline for those posts and quickly responding to them on canvas would be nice. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about history of Korea, a fascinating and dynamic nation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to other people!! The courses topic selection is fascinating and Professor Stephens really puts in a lot of effort to make sure we engage with the topics criially too. It was a great introduction to Korean modern history, at least the best Ive seen offered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Yale offers very few courses in Korean studies, and even fewer in Korean history, but this course deserves consideration on its own merits. Professor Stephens, though new to Yale, proved a gifted educator, who was happy to help students however she could. The syllabus basically takes students through Korean history from roughly 1800 to the present, with each week's readings being organized around a different aspect of everyday life (e.g., militarization, gender dynamics, the rural/urban divide, etc.). The focus on \"everyday\" history is one that should be especially attractive to students whose studies have been concentrated in histories of great governments and great leaders; for those students, a course of this nature could truly change how they understand history. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. Dr. Stephens did a great job of allowing both her lecture/insight plus our analysis/discussion. Furthermore, the limited amount of Korean Studies courses makes this class even more of a gem. The historical themes were great and interesting to tackle. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because learning about Korean history is interesting and growing international importance. I would also recommend this because the opportunity to have conversation with other students about history is very exciting, and something that I learned a lot from as a non-history major. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. Like any seminar, the quality of the class is really dependent on how engaged other students are with the course and how willing they are to contribute to discussion, but I think Professor Stephens does a good job making sure that everyone has the necessary baseline understanding of the chronology and leading discussions. The readings can be a bit heavy at times, but it's always a reasonable amount for a seminar and I generally found them pretty interesting. Overall, Korean history is really cool and this class is a great chance to learn about it. I would highly recommend it. "
