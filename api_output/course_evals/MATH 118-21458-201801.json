            "\u00a0This course gives an overview of the basics of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. It's very much the introductory stuff, but you do a lot involving matrices, vectors, derivatives, etc. I would say the skill level is similar to that of high school calculus but applied to new topics. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I internalized most of the information from the course as it was taught to me, which was very refreshing.  A positive experience in mathematics despite being someone more focused on humanities courses and topics. ",

            "\u00a0Great ",
            "\u00a0I learned Multi-variable calculus and linear algebra, at least the easy parts.  There were also nice pit stops in the class where took time to grasp deeper, more fundamental understandings of certain mathematical concepts like inverses and trigonometry. "

            "\u00a0I liked that it was a small class, so we were able to ask a lot of questions. I also felt like the weekly quizzes accurately reflected the homework and the material we needed to know for the exam, so they were useful for practice and preparation.\r\nI do wish that we had more time to do examples in class and that we went over more application/extended thought questions in class or during review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I think so far so good. ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was a lack of homework grading.  The homework was strictly there to supplement learning, which would be tested every week in the form of a quiz.  A weakness of the course was a weekly quiz, but that was the trade-off. "

            "\u00a0yes! good for ppl considering math120, but dont want to jump into that high level ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to other students. I took it over 120 because I felt like 120 moved a little too quickly for me, and I think this is a better fit. The homework sets are pretty manageable, not graded, and reviewed every week before the quiz, so if you prepare, it is not hard to do well. If the class is with Professor Rosenthal, he can be a bit abrasive at times, but I think he is very well-intended and he really seems to care about his students. ",
            "\u00a0I will only recommend this to social science major requiring very basic skills in solving multi variable functions ",
            "\u00a0Yes, he does great review sessions every week ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is really nice because it gives goes at the pace of the class, so as long as youre willing to ask questions, its difficult to fall behind. "
