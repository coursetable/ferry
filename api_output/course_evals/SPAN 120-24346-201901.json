            "\u00a0Weaknesses are that the course often moves too fast, however that is necessary to cover all the material. Strengths are that the course excels at ensuring students are comfortable speaking Spanish in a conversational setting. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in the course packet was above an L2 level at times.  To add to this, the material on the final exam was not material that was covered well in class.  Be aware of this.  The class moves to fast! ",
