            "\u00a0As someone who did not know much about Nigeria, this was a great course that gives valuable insights into the country, its customs, and people. ",

            "\u00a0Overall just learned so many cool things about Nigeria ",

            "\u00a0I was hoping to understand Nigerian history and culture more. ",
            "\u00a0I gained writing skills and critical analysis skills in this course. It helped me have a more definitive understanding of Nigeria. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much more about my own Nigerian heritage. This course really filled in the gaps, having grown up in the US instead of Nigeria. I learned so much about how my family functions and why. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about Nigerian culture not only domestically and internationally. "

            "\u00a0strengths: small class size meant that we were all very engaged in the discussions and we had a chance to get any questions answered quickly.\r\nweaknesses: there was A LOT of required writing which didn't make sense since the class is not a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging but sometimes the readings were too long and repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of writing but engaging material. Emphasis on getting questions answered for students which was great. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good introductory course in the sense that I learned a lot about different aspects of Nigeria. The class was interesting and engaging and had a good atmosphere. I feel as if the class was a little bit writing heavy and could have been balanced out in different ways. I felt as if I spent too much time writing summary and was not able to deeply engage with some of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Either make it a WR credit (I wouldnt really mind an extra section?...) or cut down on the writing! Just one essay is fine, midterm. But thats it. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of Nigerian cultures but there are generalizations made within that and the class discussions could be more guided/productive. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that the timing of reading responses meant that all students came to class ready to engage in seminars. I believe that the weaknesses of the class lay in an occasional lack of clarity about certain assignments. "

            "\u00a0I would. It is a great course to learn about Nigeria. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend. It's a lot of writing but its not difficult at all and the topics are very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they have a connection to or are really passionate about Nigeria. A lot of the class was based on previous assumptions about Nigeria and relating to personal experience. This format is beneficial for those who come from Nigerian families or have ties to similar lifestyles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even non-Nigerians. It gives a lot of perspective about Africa through the lens of Nigeria, a continent people need to learn more about. ",
            "\u00a0I think for Nigerian students, the class was an interesting forum to engage intellectually with one's identity and roots. "
