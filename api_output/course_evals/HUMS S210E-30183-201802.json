            "\u00a0This was my first college-level course I've taken, so I definitely learnt a lot as a high school student:\r\n- how to write academic papers to a college-level: improving my argument structure, clarity and logic\r\n- that almost all geniuses share common enablers, albeit 'used' differently\r\n- how to see genius differently (through the romantic lens, nineteenth century, etc)\r\n- most importantly, never to use the term 'genius' carelessly ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various \"geniuses\" that have appeared throughout history. It was also great to learn about the research that is being done on creativity in the neuroscience field because that's the field I intend to pursue. "
