I didn't have much experience writing proofs before this class, but this class forced me to learn that way of thinking. You spend the whole semester working up to a proof of Godel's Completeness theorem, proving lots of smaller things along the way and learning some basic set theory. ",

We bootstrap our intuitions into formal languages; it's not just a chess game of meaningless symbols. Sentential logic fits squarely into our FOL formalism, nicely. Distiction between form and content, syntax and semantics, chess and the game of chess. Models for language, math, and broader philosophy. ",

I think there should be. Lectures were hard to understand not Professor Shin's fault, the material's fault and I would have appreciate a chance to go over things in a section. ",
            "\u00a0The course consists of lectures and psets. The lectures are structured well and do a good job of filling in the details while keeping the big picture in mind. Your grade is based wholly in what you get on the 7 psets. This is a strength in that it makes the class a more even playing field for people without significant experience in quantitative classes. The downside to this is that it makes it easy to come away from the class without actually remembering many of the important details, since such details are only tested on psets where we have access to the handouts. In addition, the overall grade breakdown is unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are hard to follow but PSETs are very rewarding and office hours are very helpful and worth going to. ",
            "\u00a0sun-joo is amazing and funny! however, this is one of those classes where you will just have to stare at a problem until you get it, whether it takes you five minutes or five hours. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: detailed\r\nWeakness: can go faster ",
            "\u00a0This course could not have been taught better. Professor Shin is an unbelievably talented educator who deeply cares about her students' engagement with the course material. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think the course would be better suited if it met for 50 minutes instead of 75 minutes twice a week, and had a section. I would have gone to the section every week, and the nature of the material demands that one practices doing it. Doing math logic problems in the presence of a knowledgable TA would accelerate learning tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shin is incredibly organized and her lecture notes are very helpful. I found the textbook to be far less helpful than the lectures, but some people felt the other way, so I think it just depends. I also found her really open and helpful during office hours and so generous with her time. I think something that's difficult about the course is that the only work you turn in / the only feedback you get is on problem sets that add up to the entirety of your grade. It might be useful to bring back sections and tfs so that you have a chance to work on proofs that aren't necessarily for a grade. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were an engaging professor and interesting course material. One small issue: Enderton seems oriented to math majors taking math logic rather than to people without a math background, but the handouts did a nice job supplementing the book. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- great notes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- maybe it could have used a final, oral exam, to really ensure that we held onto what we learned? ",
            "\u00a0The material is taught in about the best format possible, in my opinion. All of the grades come from take-home problem sets, which really helps you work through the important ideas from lecture. It would be difficult to have any sort of in-class grade given that a lot of the work is playing with problems until you figure out a proof. ",

            "\u00a0One strength of this course is how clear Professor Shin was in setting her expectations. Her introductory lecture, which established that the goal of the course was to understand the completeness theorem of first-order logic, and her lecture handouts, which established goals for each subsequent lecture, helped me to distinguish between what was crucial to understand and what was peripheral.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the lack of an optional section. Because the problem sets were the only opportunity to master the concepts that we learned in class, doing them became very stressful. Having a section and a TF to do practice problems with would have made the problem sets far less stressful. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great professor, carefully constructed lecture notes and homeworks. Camaraderie develops in the class, which is nice. Some broader philosophy of language and math were included; these moments are always gems of insight from Sun-Joo - do more of these!\r\nWeaknesses: Presentations in the Computability and Logic course were a nice feature of that class; not sure if appropriate here. ",

I liked the fact that there were no tests, and your entire grade is based on the psets, but that's definitely a matter of taste.\r\nProfessor Shin isn't the MOST clear in class, so I often found parts of the lectures hard to follow, but she gives you VERY detailed lecture notes and office hours are extremely helpful.\r\nThe semester that I took it, there wasn't a TA. Try to take it when there's a TA, and when the TA is helpful at explaining concepts. When I took it, because there was no section, lectures felt long (75 minutes) and there wasn't necessarily much room for asking questions. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: The psets are very challenging and there is little to no help given in solving them, nor solutions provided after they are graded. This makes it hard to improve if you are weak at proofs or do not know how to do them. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is that Sun-Joo is an excellent lecturer. She is engaging, has a great sense of humor, and always makes sure everyone understands each topic before moving on. Also, there are no exams or papers, only 7 psets (this may be a weakness for some). Sun-Joo is very helpful during office hours, but unfortunately there are no TAs or peer tutors, so you only get one style of teaching explanation, and the times of office hours are fairly limited. ",

But it's so satisfying when you're able to apply concepts to proofs and come up with creative solutions. If you're not a math person, don't take it lightly but still maybe take it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if youre interested in formal logic. The material is covered very clearly, and the big theorems (soundness and completeness of first order logic) get covered in just enough time. If youre a math major, this will be one of the easiest math classes you take; but if not, you might have to work pretty hard. ",

It might be a little slow if you are a hardcore math person. Sun-Joo is amazing and so helpful and really wants you to learn. As she herself says, the final result of the class is not mindblowing, but that result paves the way for mindblowing results later on. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Professor Shin is a remarkable professor and lecturer and is great at explaining difficult concepts. The PSETs are just the right level of challenge and are really rewarding. Lectures are difficult to keep up with, though. ",

Professor Shin is an unbelievably talented educator who deeply cares about her students' engagement with the course material. \r\n\r\nIt would have been better if the course had a section, but going to Professor Shin's office hours is a blast and she will patiently guide you through the material if you put in the effort. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this class is not a gut, and will require many hours to get a lot out of the course. But it is definitely worth it! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in logic, yes! Professor Shin is fantastic and the course was interesting and well-organized. Despite being listed in philosophy it's not really a philosophy class, so if that's what you're looking for this isn't the course for you (I think it was mostly math-philosophy majors). I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I took it. If you haven't had a ton of math, I would take First Order Logic first. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with reservations. It was very rewarding and interesting throughout, but nonmath majors should be prepared to attend office hours for each problem set. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in the more philosophical side of math, which is obvious in the course title. It's pretty niche, but if you go for the subject matter you'll really like it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in learning about Godel's Completeness Theorem for first order logic. It's a lot of proof writing and extremely abstract material with little obvious practical application, so the class isn't for everyone. But it's well-taught and the workload is manageable and for the most part interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Will help you with anything that deals with set theory and will give you practice with proofs ",
            "\u00a0For anyone who wants to deepen their grasp of first order logic and understand what the stakes of logic are, I recommend this course. I would NOT recommend it to anyone who hasn't taken first order logic or comes to the course from a mathematical background. Without either of these backgrounds, I don't know if you would have the intuition that helps familiarize the concepts. For anyone who does have one or both of these backgrounds, I wholeheartedly recommend. Professor Shin is an excellent instructor who makes the material fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in exploring a rather unique area of math, and want to learn some interesting results about the logical systems we commonly use today. If this is your first proof-based math course, you might find it significantly harder than a few others, but you will also improve drastically by the end of the course. If you're interested in the philosophical aspects of math, you might be slightly disappointed since not much time is spent in the course itself on such discussions. However, the skills you build will help you immensely in future philosophical courses, and it's definitely worth mulling over the philosophical aspects of the things you learn in this course in your spare time or at office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Interesting material and great lectures. The assugnments are a rewarding form of challenge ",
            "\u00a0Do take. Dovetails nicely with Computability and Logic. Useful for anyone in the linguistics, philosophy, computer science, or math areas. Beautiful proofs that speak to you on a deeper level than just the result you're showing, which itself can be very interesting. You will have a more rigorous view of the world after a class like this! ",
            "\u00a0If you want a challenging, thought-provoking QR, take it! It's one of those math classes that will make you think differently about the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone interested in conceptual maths or looking for an interesting QR. ",

            "\u00a0Unless you are very interested in mathematical logic, this course is not for you. You dont learn skills that are applicable to other areas other than logic/math proofs. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, with one caveat. The course is very interesting (if you like logic and proofs), and the professor is a great teacher and is super engaging and friendly. Unfortunately, at least this semester, it is nearly impossible to get an A. The cutoff between an A and an A- this year was over 96%, and since the class is completely based on psets (1000 points total) this means that you must have lost no less than 40 points across all psets throughout the entire semester to receive an A. I feel like that is an extremely high bar and very unfair to those who got in the mid-to-low 90s and received an A- or lower, considering a 96% would be an A in every other class I have heard of at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in mathematical logic, but beware the \"mathematical\" component.  As a math major I didn't find the class incredibly difficult to follow and found the material interesting and applicable to my work, but philosophy/non-STEM majors might struggle a little more.  I didn't take First Order Logic, but from what I've been told the class structure and expectations are somewhat different, and this class felt more like a math class than anything else. "
