            "\u00a0I learned a lot about research methods. Honestly learned a ton about how to conduct good research and what to look for as a critical evaluator of research. ",

            "\u00a0Designing a research study, writing a research paper, conducting a research study using MTurk ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze data and research, as well as be a more concise writer! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely gained a lot of psychological writing skills. Also, the ability to churn out papers quickly and iterate on feedback, which I think will be a great skill moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough understanding of what research is, how to critically think about research, and how to write my own research paper. "

            "\u00a0I loved this course. Work was a little heavy towards the midterm but no other weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Prof. Hirsch and Shina were very hands on in helping us learn/improve. I loved the round table feedback sessions, and felt like they were very constructive in helping me improve my study design and write ups \r\n- Quizzes: helped me better understand what I was learning from the readings ",
            "\u00a0this course is SO MUCH WORK. And I know Prof Hirsch warns us about that at the beginning of the semester, but seriously BE WARNED. I definitely underestimated how much I'd need to commit to this class and towards the end it became less about learning about research methods and more just scraping by along with all my other classes. I know this is a requirement, but if you can take it in an easier semester, definitely do that. Also with the writing assignments, they would often grade us harshly and then give somewhat vague feedback, which was kind of disheartening. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a lot of strengths, such as the weekly quizzes, breakdown of writing parts of the research paper, in class \"lab meetings\" when writing our individual papers, etc. However, I believe that the instructors could have prepared us better for some minor details with regards to writing the papers. Reading a list of common mistakes, for example, would have been extremely helpful when writing the first draft of our research papers. I feel as though it is more fair to take off points for how the paper is written rather than taking off points for minute details that we were unaware about. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even though this is technically a requirement for the Psychology major, the writing intensive research methods class drastically improved my writing quality and helped me better formulate research papers/study designs ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a lot of work, but you definitely learn a lot. I never pictured myself doing research - and now I will be doing so for my psychology senior thesis project! "
