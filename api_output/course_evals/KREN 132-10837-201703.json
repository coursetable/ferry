            "\u00a0Very enjoyable class with very reasonable workload despite meeting 5 times a week. You get to practice conversational skills in Korean. The textbook was relatively confusing but the movie we were watching was good and conducive to learning Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop my listening and speaking skills more. ",
            "\u00a0Korean culture, vocab, grammar ",
            "\u00a0My ability to write and read Korean improved greatly, and I learned many new vocabulary words. As a heritage student, I also learned the basic grammatical structures of Korean and that helped me understand why I say the things I say. I also learned a lot of aspects of Korean culture through the various readings we did in class. Overall, my Korean improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good amount of grammar and vocabulary in addition to improving my speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was the perfect continuation/consolidation of my korean skills developed at Yale and abroad. I learned how to better communicate in korean writing while also learning new colloquial phrases from the drama we watched during class. "

            "\u00a0Choi seonsaengnim is very nice and reasonable in her grading/assessment. She even invites us to her house for a Korean BBQ party. As it is now, the class is a good mix between Korean American who got placed directly into L3 and students coming back from Light Fellowship, which means that it is a very good environment for everyone to polish any skills they need (reading, writing, speaking, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: not too difficult and Professor Choi doesnt grade too harshly.\r\nWeaknesses: everyday classes and nearly everyday quizzes but thats a language class ",
            "\u00a0I think that there could be more focus on free speaking. Professor Choi jumps around between topics which allowed us to cover many topics, but only at the surface-level. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Teach you a lot about Korean literacy and grammar\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more emphasis in improving fluency in speaking ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: relatively low workload, really fun class because we do a variety of activities, material is not overly difficult\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not very structured, the schedule is sometimes difficult to understand, sometimes the professor does not communicate to us very well but overall we were all able to figure out what she wanted us to do in the end ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of moving through a lot of material in terms of vocabulary and grammar. However, due to the pace of the course, its hard to master individual sections of the class and rather you find yourself studying more for tests to try and thoroughly understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The drama assigned was both a strength and weakness because it was a great educational tool but also a very big time commitment. With 52 hour long episodes, the drama was the most demanding aspect of the class to me, so I think I shorter drama wouldve been more enjoyable/easier to actually enjoy due to the lessening of time stress.

            "\u00a0Definitely take it. You will love it more than you think you'll do. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Choi is so nice and makes an effort to get to know her students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it!! It's a great, not too hard class and Choi is the best! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because Professor Choi really does care for her students! She is always available and is always willing to help. The course is taught a bit disorganizedly, but it was still my favorite class of the semester and I learned a lot as well as made some amazing friends. The course workload is also not bad at all, so I highly recommend overall! ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in learning Korean at a fast pace, its basically understood that you need to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend this course. If you do the homework diligently, then the exams/projects should be relatively easy! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend any Yale korean course to other students. "
