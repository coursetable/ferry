            "\u00a0It was hard at times to follow the presentations because they would go really fast. For instance we did both Chinese Theater and Japanese Theater in one week and it felt like a lot of information to unpack from two very distinct cultures in two short days. I often found myself feeling lost. ",
            "\u00a0The only time I thought the organization of the course did not make sense was when we were watching video lectures, going to live lectures, and going to discussion groups as the live lectures never really found the right mixture between redundant information and new information. The week it worked best was when the live lecture was less scripted and more of a class-wide discussion group / seminar style course. Paul introduced some new information (Native American practices) in the class in order to emphasize the lessons learned through the video lectures and tie it in to another culture (which was absolutely fascinating). ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very well organized but it moved so fast that sometimes I felt completely lost in an overwhelming amount of info. ",
            "\u00a0Some powerpoints never finished, lectures left little room for in class discovery or discussion. ",
            "\u00a0One if not THE most rigid course outlines and syllabuses of my YSD experience to date. Seemingly the most traditional academic course within at least my YSD curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0There was obviously a lot of care and consideration put into how the course was curated. However, I think a lot of us are still hungry for more time spent in non-western theatrical practices. ",
            "\u00a0It moved way, way, way too fast and lacked passion in its approach. It was a class of busy work and I wish it would've been taught by someone with a passion for people and experiences as opposed to how time has passed and who did what when. ",
            "\u00a0A little confusing to jump from place to place, but probably inevitable based on material covered. ",
            "\u00a0very well laid out, we knew what was going to be talked about, and for how long. ",
            "\u00a0Canvas was used heavily to organize class material. It is a great resource for this class, but was not organized in a way that was helpful. You had to search through a variety of folders to find the information necessary for the reading or for class. The path was often different. Organizing material in chronological order would be very helpful. ",

            "\u00a0My Teaching Assistant didn't really put an effort into the discussion section of the class. While my peers in different discussion groups had the chance to unpack the lectures during their discussions, my section would spend a lot of time diverting away from the topics at hand and there felt to be very little organization and direction. In turn, instead of spending the time for discussion trying to clear up any confusions from the lectures, whenever we'd ask questions, the answer that seemed to be repeated constantly was \"it's all in the powerpoints\". It wasn't all in the powerpoints. ",
            "\u00a0After the midterm, my group discussed with Ilya what we would like to see from him in future group discussions and so things did improve, but prior to the midterm our discussion group really struggled. There was almost no link between lectures, discussion questions, or the discussion group sessions at all. Ilya left a lot of the guidance of the session to us, and he played more of a passive moderator just to keep discussion going when things fizzled. It would have been very helpful / welcomed to have a lesson put together that would help us soak in a bit of the information presented within the live lecture and allow us to comment / ask questions about the materials. Which is what we started to move towards as the semester progressed, but still had some work to do in order to have that scenario really play out. ",
            "\u00a0Having a discussion section is helpful, however I am not engaged during lecture periods and find it difficult to concentrate. ",
            "\u00a0I loved my discussion section! But in terms of in class discussion, I felt that Professor Walsh left no time for us to speak and never seemed to really try to. There was no place made for us to ask questions during lecture or after. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyed the early part of the semester where video lectures happened on Tuesday, Paul gave lecture to reinforce on Thursday and seemed to have more time for questions those weeks than when he lectured on both days in the latter part of the semester. The time to ask questions and have Paul move in other directions with the material on those Thursday's was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0We were instructed in lecture time and we got our points talking in discussion time. The discussion wasn't guided well and it wasn't fun. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though, with few exceptions, most of the information came from Instruction. Discussion was poorly organized and not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It was good because we broke out into smaller groups, but I wish that Paul engaged with us more in class. He was so focused on reading the slides that he couldn't even see when people raised their hands to ask a question. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions in the small groups were sometimes great, and other times detrimental.  The instruction in the lectures was just that, only lecturing with a few minutes of questions at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The section leader did an excellent job of leading group discussion that kept me engaged even on days where my mind wanted to be elsewhere. Paul's lectures were very informative but the pace was a bit too fast. It was easy to get lost or lose information if I was trying to take notes. I found I enjoyed the lectures more if I did not attempt notes. The vast amount of information that each lecture went over made little time for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0There has clearly been lots of thought and refinement in the building of this course. I thought it was very effective for the vast amount of information that was covered. I really enjoyed my discussion group and it was invaluable in helping connect all the information together. ",
            "\u00a0The lab portion of the class was not well organized and our discussions were not useful. It would be more helpful to discuss the play that we just read reflecting on the lecture from that. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture portions where rapid fire, with little time for engagement with the instructor at the end. The discussion groups were more productive for me than the lectures, there was adequate time and guidance to explore the material we were presented. I ended up almost exclusively taking notes in the discussion groups as there was barely time in the lecture to even look away from the presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the small groups prepped us more for the exam.  It was hit or miss.  Sometimes the instructor would really prep us, and sometimes we would talk about the play alone.  I wish there was more context. ",
            "\u00a0The inclusion of the discussion groups definitely aids this lack of in-class-discussion. I understand that the breadth of material makes it near impossible to offer time for in-class discussion, though. So, I am thankful for the discussion groups! ",
            "\u00a0Since the class was a lecture format it didn't leave much room for investigation and exploration. I felt like Paul was just talking at me and reading from a script. The best part of the course was the discussion group which moved at a slower more interactive pace. "

            "\u00a0In regards to the paper, it was clear that there was a lot of time spent on some periods than others, namely western theater, so it was easier to write about what we had spent the most time on. The exams to me felt like a crash course on memorization. ",
            "\u00a0I support the idea of the paper, but find the format to have been an odd choice. While my schedule appreciated the fact that the paper was in the same format as the essays on the exams, I struggled seeing the point of the assignment considering it wasn't a full blown research paper with formatting and references required, and that the majority of the topics offered were things we had discussed in class therefore research was not required at all unless we picked the topics that had yet to be discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly discussion prompts were helpful in understanding the material and ensuring I was up to speed in the course. The essay was very similar in structure and objective to my previous schools, so I did not find them overly challenging or scary. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of work but I don't see an inherent problem with that as expectations of that work was much more clearly defined than in other YSD courses I have experienced. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know what the aims were, so I can't tell you. My experience, however, was....dry. ",
            "\u00a0The work aligned well with the aims, but it felt like there was too much work in general. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the tests are overly difficult for the aim of the course - to have an understanding of theatre history.  The tests are excessive.  What would be better would be weekly or bi-weekly quizzes with essays that cover those weeks' topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would have preferred a more narrowed prompt for the essay assignment. The weekly discussion prompt were fairly straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly disagree with the need to write a paper in this course. With the weekly discussions, readings, and short answers questions this course is already a heavy workload on the back of a drama student. With so much extra work, the students eventually stop actually reading the plays and have to opt for summaries or skimming. I think that does the subject matter a great disservice. ",

Often times the discussion group would focus on lectures rather than readings as well which meant that there were plenty of times in which it felt like we were reading plays just to read them but would never really talk about them. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the reading matched well with the weekly discussion. I loved my TA and any reserves I had about talking or asking questions were dispelled because of his generosity and kindness. ",
            "\u00a0I would agree with a comment that was made on the last class day that when I could watch the video lectures earlier than the Tuesday of the standard lecture and in turn prior to reading the play I was more able to apply that knowledge to the reading. Which then made for a more engaging class with Paul on Thursday and discussion within the discussion group class. ",
            "\u00a0There are a handful of plays that were just not going to make it onto my schedule to read, but I'm still glad they were assigned, and I learned as much about them as I could, and that seemed acceptable to me and to the discussions. ",

I wish they were always posted the weekend before.  It's so hard to finish the response during the week. ",

            "\u00a0I absolutely appreciated and enjoyed the video lectures. Not only did it give me a chance to take thorough notes by pausing and / or rewinding the video numerous times, but it was great being able to decide when I was going to engage with those lectures --- what I mean is, I was able to watch the videos when I was more awake / alert and able to really focus on the information presented. Thanks to the lectures, I felt incredibly prepared for the midterm in regards to the Greek and Roman eras as we had numerous video lectures around those times. My notes were thorough and easy to study, but also having been able to take thorough notes meant I retained more from watching the lectures. Transitioning into live lectures where we have not had the video lectures has meant a drastic change in my notes and how much information I am actually retaining. In short, I do not feel prepared for the final in comparison to where I was with the midterm. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the semester I thought having access to the power points would be helpful, but because of how they are used within the lectures they turned out to be the least helpful elements. The power points usually contained different information than what was being lectured on in that moment, used in the manner that would be best in an instructional video, and phased through too quickly to take notes on what was being presented or even read the slides. In many cases I had to force myself to ignore the slides in order to focus my energy on listening to the lecture and taking notes. ",
            "\u00a0The video lectures were incredibly helpful. I benefited from being able to structure my Tuesday mornings in ways that would make me the most productive, being able to stop and start the lecture to go back and take notes at my own pace, and being able to go back and review them prior to the midterm exam. I distinctly felt their loss in the latter half of the semester and anticipate that I would have been able to prepare much better for the final had we still had the video lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think the films were very helpful in terms of going back and reviewing but I could not often tell what was important and what was not. I think the first couple weeks of class were stressful because I could not discern what was important based on the videos. \r\n\r\nBut the videos are very helpful as supplements to the class lectures.

            "\u00a0Video lectures allowed me to pause and work at my pace. The added videos of performance were great for context and a better understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The videos were GREAT.  It's wonderful to have a video guide to the lecture that I can pause and take notes, do additional research, and revisit.  The production value of the videos was GREAT.  I found a drastic different between my engagement in first half of year with videos and second half when they were no longer available. Three sessions a week is NOT sustainable in this YSD schedule.  It is just a completely unreasonable workload - and the value of the classes became ineffectual as productions picked up.  The video in lieu of one lecture allowed me to ingest on my own schedule, at my own pace.  It's more equitable for people who don't have a theater background (me).  I was able to pause and look up information that brought more meaning and value to the remainder of the video lecture - instead of being a bit lost throughout. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot more information in the slideshows than we are ever asked to retain on the tests. I have a hard time with that inconsistency. I spent a lot of time trying to remember all of the most important names during early French Baroque theater only to find that none of it was actually deemed \"important\". ",

            "\u00a0I am sorry to say it but this class is not rigorously taught. There is no thesis statement or original way of presenting the information in Paul's lectures. \r\nHe reads pre-scripted lectures that have no real drive to main points but sound mostly like a wash of facts. His language is too wordy and inaccessible. \r\nThe powerpoints didn't correspond to his written lectures making note-taking a frustrating task. I don't know why Paul expected the inclusion of paintings/scultptures of the time periods without much explanation to supplement explaining cultural/theatrical trends of the same periods. I have an art history degree and was shocked at how he included art historical references without diving into them and making valid connections with theatre of the moment. That's a whole separate course that needs unpacking if they're going to be at all useful. ",

I feel as if we touched on it when discussing Shaminism, and then went write back to being talked at. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's the shortness of the semester versus the content of the class, but I felt like information was being shoved down my throat and I was expected to have an opinion on things that I couldn't relate to. There was no structure for discussion groups, all of us were just making enough comments to get points as opposed to having really interesting discussions about the work and how it reflects present day theatre. I would've loved to connect the past of theatre to the present or all that it's influenced in-between, but that is not what we did. I don't know what we did, I was just required to go. ",

I think that it is unfair to try to judge anyone by anything other than attendance, and I think that engaging in the subject matter should just be a given after that.
