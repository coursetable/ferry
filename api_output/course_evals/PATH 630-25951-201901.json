            "\u00a0In this class, I have learned research methods and developed the result in analysis on paper on tissue engineering and biomaterials. The class is design in a way that the first parts of the class cover basic foundation topics regarding immunology and biomaterials and the second parts of the class focus on learning issue/ disease and current researches on that topic. I think having this type of style is very helpful for us to prepare us to properly conduct research and effectively analyze research papers. And most of the class is focus on developing these important research skills. ",
