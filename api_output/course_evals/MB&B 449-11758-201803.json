            "\u00a0reading scientific papers much better, context for a lot of material covered in 300 and 301, theoretical experimental processes ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a scientist. This class, from day one, forces you to jump on board and read complex papers with recent research into medicine and basic science as well. ",
            "\u00a0The class introduced me to a diverse array of impactful papers dealing with various diseases involving the biochemical pathways and concepts we learned about mostly in MB&B 301. I learned to efficiently read and process (a lot of) scientific papers, engage in productive discussions about science during the timed group quizzes, and synthesize the literature on a field into a mini-review and a research proposal, the two big writing assignments in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze and read scientific papers as well as learned how research fits into the overall arc of developing therapies for diseases. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about various topics in weekly lectures. Learned how to more efficiently read papers. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is strong because it pushes you to learn papers and write like a true scientist. With a lot of the research and writing, I learned so much about thinking and writing like a professor. The class is stressful every wednesday because you have to do discussion questions within the span of the class. However, when class is over, its over. Also, the papers are a lot to write and take a while to research. Overall, it was a good class. ",
            "\u00a0This course has such potential--fantastic professors, interesting material, well taught lectures. All of these aspects made this course I was looking forward to the most in my Yale College career as a synthesis between all of the time you've put in lab and the medical field you'll (most likely) go into. Unfortunately, the course grading and the overall structure are disasters and truly a disheartening end to a difficult and rewarding major. There is no reason why an upper-level MB&B elective should be a furious race against the clock every single week in an attempt to answer questions about the papers. This does not facilitate learning. No other elective in any department functions like this. I really cannot stress how ridiculous, ill-conceived, and distressing this class structure is because it is so antithetical to learning the interesting and important material. A much better design would be to do the lectures on Wednesday, assign the papers and questions, and then discuss the questions in groups on Monday to then be turned in later that day. ",
            "\u00a0The Monday lectures were (mostly) awesome. Most lecturers were able to utilize their unique teaching style to present a disease, as well as its molecular basis, with clarity. The diverse array of instructors and research fields made the class a satisfying overview (while still going into sufficient detail) of how discoveries in basic science can lead to potential therapies. One or two of the professors, however, ended up going into a LOT of detail in a not-so-organized way, making it hard to follow the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday quizzes could have been better structured to reduce the stress placed on students. For starters, making the quizzes only go until 2:15 (i.e. making them a little shorter) would have been ideal, as some students had class at 2:30 and had to leave early, leaving their team with one less person for the remainder of the quiz time. In addition, it was difficult to internalize/discuss any feedback received on the quizzes, as they were passed out to one group member at the beginning of the class without dedicated time to review them. Making copies of past quizzes (with corrections) for each student and having a dedicated 5-10 minutes at the beginning of class to go over comments would have been very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the module/topical format of the class was amazing, allowing us to sample scientific problems in different disease areas. It really built on my previously acquired knowledge of experiments and biochemistry from classes I've taken.\r\n\r\nA potential weakness is that the weekly quizzes are not standardized; on certain weeks, the questions were so long and difficult that the quizzes could not be finished and did not necessarily accurately reflect my understanding on the papers we were assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Promoting collaboration is not something explicitly done in many STEM courses, making this a strong attribute of the course. Normalizing the difficulty of the weekly questions would be good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: different topics/lecturers keeps the course fresh and exciting. Prof Steitz is a gem. Weaknesses: inconsistent in Wednesday group work questions and also not very transparent in grading? There's no rubric. Also the group work is pretty stressful, especially if the group doesn't get along. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- course organized very well.\r\n\r\nI wish instead of having discussion questions that tested us on our comprehension of the papers, that we could take the time to bring up critiques of the data. I felt the course was lacking in allowing students to express our criticisms and understanding of the methodological flow of these articles -- maybe having a few discussion sections where we answer questions about critical questions surrounding the validity of data would be a useful addition to the course.\r\n\r\nI also think the course should move the deadline for a full outline/first draft of the final paper to an earlier day (~ one week before the deadline) in order to assist students in revising their papers. Also moving the final abstract deadline up could assist with this as well. "

            "\u00a0It's more work than it seems (dependent somewhat on the TFs) but you really do learn a lot, and from some of the best scientists Yale has ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to another student, with a strong background in biochemistry. It assumes an advanced knowledge of topics and techniques and you really need to know them on the back of your hand. ",
            "\u00a0Take it for the professors and the material, if you can keep your sanity throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in some combination of biology basic science research and medicine. It opened my eyes as to how basic science research actually goes from bench to bedside through the development of novel therapeutics. Now that you've taken (survived) 301 and gained all this knowledge (even if you need a refresher), it's so satisfying and fascinating to finally be able to understand the molecular basis of various diseases, as well as what therapies are out there or being developed to treat them. Though 301 also contributed, I think I gained a *full* appreciation of the MB&B major after taking this class. It's also a great chance to meet other MB&B majors and do group quizzes with them (though they're randomly assigned groups), even if sometimes you might have to learn to overcome incompatibilities in personalities, lol. Overall, such a fun class that teaches you not only a ton about the research that's going on, but also HOW to both read and write about it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think this course is a gem in the MB&B department, allowing me to apply what I learned in classes to the bigger picture. You get a better understanding of how science is translated into disease outcomes and therapies, and it was overall a great class to begin to understand the bench-to-bedside transition. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if you want a greater understanding of how research changes medicine and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting material covered. A wide berth of subjects that you need specialists to explain. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're okay with timed responses. Monday lectures are lowkey but Wednesday group work is stressful. The lecturers are generally pretty good and interesting. The final paper is pretty involved and due during reading period so be careful there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is one of the most popular MB&B electives for good reason. You learn about a wide range of disease and research areas from leaders within their fields, and you hone your scientific literature reading skills. Professor Steitz is a great professor who challenges you to think on a higher level. TAs are great and fair in helping you navigate the course. Discussion sections can be a bit stressful and working within a group dynamic will allow a lot of students to practice group work skills that most MB&B students likely don't ever practice in their other courses.  Work ahead as much as you can on the final paper -- it'll pay off in the end if you find a topic and really dig into the literature around that topic early. "
