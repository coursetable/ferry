The assignments took more time; in order of most to least, THE FINAL PROJECT, a one-page summary of an aspect of the food system, one book review, a literature review. These are the most significant ones. The final project takes a lot of time. ",

            "\u00a0Enjoyed this course a lot. Learned a lot of new material. Was very engaging and informative. Class structure was good. I liked the case studies and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Overall assessment: excellent course that pushes you to think about issues and aspects of society in a different way.\r\n\r\nStrengths: emphasis on individual reflection and assimilation of ideas.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: discussion worked off a lot of assumed values without really debating whether, for example, small farms are the way to go. While I am a pretty strong proponent of the aforementioned, these assumptions meant we didn't always grapple with existing structures well (like the large amount of consolidation that already exists in wealthy countries) besides just saying \"oh yeah that is bad.\" ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the stimulating readings, nutrient chart, and data bases for digging into food and nutrition security information. The syllabus content is quite good.\r\nImprovements, I would say that the final project could be better design in the sense of narrowing down the results. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Modules were a good way of tackling complex concepts within global food and nutrition \r\n- Books that we read also provided greater depth to the wide array of topics that we covered \r\n- Nutrient chart that we filled out at the beginning provided a nice framework for the topics and discussions that we would continue to discuss throughout the course \r\n- The handouts that we were given in class provided very good opportunities to build and to exercise statistical literacy\r\n- There was representation from Forestry, Public Health, and Yale College, which I think contributed to rich discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The workload got a little heavy toward the end because of the way that the assignments were scheduled.  If there were a way to space them out a little more, I think that would be ideal ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very informative and eye-opening ",
            "\u00a0My overall assessment is that this is a great course that covers a broad range of material. ",
            "\u00a0This course - smartly separated into 3 modules - has many strengths: from the professor's openness to feedback to the numerous, smaller (but manageable) assignments rather than one bulky exam or final to the stimulating, module-appropriate readings to the fun nutrition chart and beyond!  The class moved much more dynamically than most, which felt correct at each step (what worked for the nutrient chart in module 1 wouldn't have been as appropriate for the broader questions/topics of module 2).  I'd certainly recommend the nutrient chart over the infectious disease/nutrition quiz format, since I absorbed and retained the former material much better, though others may feel differently.  The example studies on the 1-page handouts were also helpful to \"see\" how nutrition and food science is achieved (or not).  The only major weakness was the confusion about the final paper, both in terms of course expectations and the hard-to-pin-down \"regional\" trends/variables.  Oh, and wishing we'd met one another at Debbie's house sooner in the term (many of us are friends now and only regret not bonding as a class sooner)!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class--one of the best I have taken at Yale. It changed my view of nutrition and gave me an understanding of the field that I didn't have before. The only thing I would change would be to spend a bit more time on synthesis of nutrients and of diseases. Ie., we dedicated class periods to individual nutrients, but I would love to have had class periods synthesizing what it all means together. Which nutrients should policymakers focus on most? Etc. A minor point though, overall everything went really well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Diversity of assignments, class format - interactive lecture style, emphasis on group work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some assessments were too close together, could have been spaced out more, more feedback and a faster turnaround on assignments would have been nice. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Humphries is amazingly open and receptive to student feedback; she even sat down with us early in the term one-on-one to solicit it!  She was also able to lead discussion in directed yet open-ended ways -- no easy feat!!  I appreciate her feedback on our assignments, and only wish we'd gotten a bit more direction on the last group project.   Thank you for a phenomenal class that taught me so much about food, nutrition, infectious disease, and broad concepts of human health, and how to think critically about research and policy in these spaces! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Humphries is very passionate and articulate about public health and more dedicated to her students than most professors I have had. I really appreciated her taking time to meet individually with everyone in the class to figure out their learning priorities. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: So incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about this field, and it really came across, invested in students personally - set up one-on-ones, invited class for dinner, always prepared and had great anecdotes that added to the richness of the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe more feedback on assessments, but really there isn't much.

            "\u00a0After taking this course, you'll have a good sense of the various issues and topics that are pertinent to global health and nutrition, as well as the trends (e.g., urbanization) that affect these issues and topics.  \r\n\r\nIt's a complex subject and a very important one to tackle.  I recommend taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it and I have. Very interesting way to tie nutrition into chronic and infectious diseases ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Would recommend and dont be intimidated to take it as an undergrad. You learn science behind different micronutrients role in the body and also social science principles about public health research and policy in general, and also you learn how to use to a lot of really useful databases. The discussions were interesting and Professor Humphries never fails to raise thought-provoking points. There are three main modules: learning about nutrients' impact in the body, the socio-political / economic forces at play in the food system (my personal fave), and learning how deficiencies in these nutrients interact with disease. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest at all in food, nutrition, infectious disease, or health (as a broad, intersectional concept), I would 100% recommend this course to you!  Over the course of the term - broken down into three thematic modules - you will hone your skills in study design, data analysis and interpretation, and general critical thinking and reasoning necessary for successful, sustainable public health policy and practice.  I knew little to nothing about food and nutrition going into the course, and now I feel so much more comfortable picking up a peer-reviewed journal article on these topics and digging into the nitty gritty.  The professor does a great job leading you through the material while not dictating or holding your hand through any \"right\" way of understanding it.  This open-ended framework allowed for us to learn from her as well as one another through in-class discussion.  Definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Provides a great overview of human nutrition and challenges a lot of preconceived notions. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course if you're interested in how food functions in our bodies and greater food justice issues. It's a survey course with not a lot of depth, but you get plenty of breadth regarding interactions and the role of food and disease, nutrients in food and how our bodies respond to these nutrients, as well as broader food system issues.
