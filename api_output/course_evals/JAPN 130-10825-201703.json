            "\u00a0I learned intermediate Japanese grammar patterns, how to speak more naturally, new kanji and vocabulary, and a bit about Japanese culture. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the Japanese language such as speaking skills, reading skills, writing skills, and grammar skills. ",
            "\u00a0Japanese requires commitment to achieve, but the program is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0As this was my third semester of Japanese, I felt that my vocabulary and grammar were greatly increased. We also began doing reading comprehension this semester, which I thought was beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit of Japanese this year, which was really wonderful. It's a great feeling to look back at some of my books in Japanese after this semester and be able to read a bit more than before. My one regret is that I didn't speak enough Japanese in class, but that was my own fault, and I plan to fix that next semester or next year so that I can learn even more. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my speaking through vocab and grammar memorization. My writing improved the most, as I can use basic sentence structures to create essays. ",
            "\u00a0I further learned how to use Japanese to read, write and communicate in daily life. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course material in itself is not too difficult; however, the pace of the class is so fast and the amount of homework assigned is so much that the class becomes very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard to really memorize the kanji if all we ever really do with them is take a brief quiz. We never engage with them outside of the practice sheets or practice using them in sentences. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class definitely provides the right environment for working towards fluency. There is a lot of partner work, a good amount of speaking, writing and listening, as well as one on one clinics outside of class.\r\nHowever, this class is a ton of work. I understand that it is 1.5 credits, but it is still significantly more work than any other class I have taken at Yale thus far. ",
            "\u00a0There weren't many weaknesses from what I experienced, I don't think a very rigorous course load is a weakness, though for someone already taking many hard courses, it might be very stressful. I felt that the assignments given did a very good job of preparing me for tests. There were no trick questions, so long as the student kept up with the homework and readings. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in going to Japan or taking Japanese all the way up to L5 or majoring in East Asian Studies, I would highly recommend this course. Otherwise, this course is too much work compared to the practical benefits that I receive from learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, however, you must be very dedicated to learning Japanese. It is a very intensive course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone if they are willing to put in the effort. The class is not a GUT, and the senseis are all wonderful people who students should try to make an effort to know. ",
            "\u00a0If someone is very interested in learning the Japanese language, I would highly recommend. However, if someone is only trying to check off their distributional requirement, I would try to find a less intense language. ",
            "\u00a0To a student who really is passionate about Japanese and wants to learn it, this course does a fantastic job. If you are just looking for a language credit though, know that this is a hard one. I imagine it isn't too fun if you don't enjoy the language. ",
            "\u00a0Prepare to work more than in L1 and L2. It's a very fast-paced, more intense course, with more complicated grammar structures and same, if not more, amount of vocab as in L2. Sura Sura is a change of pace, but was fun to read the essays and to see that the past semesters have built you to be able to read multi-paragraph articles. It's rewarding if you're ready to be truly immersed in Japanese culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Teachers are very nice and keeping up with everyone's study. They are supportive and patient so that everyone can really improve their language skills and be able to get a real sense of speaking the language. "
