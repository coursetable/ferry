            "\u00a0Lectures were AMAZING!! Professor Casetti it engaging, passionate, and knowledgeable, a unique combination that makes this class worth taking if you can take it with him. This class was very philosophical in nature, and a great way to introduce yourself to media and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Media Studies and what different areas can be occupied by media. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of media theory and different scholars perspectives on the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the viewpoints of a variety of different media theorists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about media. ",

            "\u00a0Minimal things about media ",
            "\u00a0It was the first film class I have taken at all and loved it - it was so interesting to learn about important media theorists and their schools of thought ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the philosophy and methods behind past and modern mediums. I also learned about the why? of media and not just the how? For example, why certain mediums are effective at certain times and why some aren't. ",
            "\u00a0How to think critically about objects that I otherwise would have never given a second thought, and how these media affect my everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different media theorists such as Debord, Ranciere, and Kittler. I also learned how to analyze various institutions as objects. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about well-known philosophers and media theorists that I had not been exposed to before. I also became familiar with terms such as aura, media determinism, and others that have come up in other courses as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about the nature of the relationship between media and ourselves. I honestly think very differently about my interactions with my phone, laptop, and specific applications. These days anyone would benefit from taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of theory on what mediums are and how we interact with our surroundings. Very interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I never would have thought that learning about media theory would be helpful in any way other than getting this prereq out of the way, but it actually really offered my valuable ways to think about the world! "

        [
            "\u00a0It is not very structured, However, the material is interesting if you enjoy technology and media, plus Casetti is a very engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-run. I really appreciated the guest speakers! Sometimes, the readings were long and could have been more engaging. However, I enjoyed the lectures and sections. I wish the lectures were not at 9:25am. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the class feels a bit weird and disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely exposed me to a wide variety of media theorists, but the scheduling of the course was a bit confusing. It sometimes seemed like we were a week ahead in the readings and a week behind in our discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the lectures felt pretty disorganized, Casetti is engaging at times but doesn't really communicate well to his students. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings could be difficult at times -- including blurbs in the syllabus that offer more elaboration might be useful ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were a bit dry, but I'm not sure how that can be improved. The readings were incredibly slow some weeks also. ",
            "\u00a0Tended to become almost overly philosophical and hard to follow at times. There were certain sentences and arguments made by the scholars we studied that did not seem to make logical sense at all, but would be discussed as if scripture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were so compelling and Casetti always kept them interesting. The only thing I'd say is that over the course of the semester, people began not attending as much, especially because it's a 9:25. I think this course would work better if Casetti banned laptops and/or moved the class to a later time. ",
            "\u00a0It is interesting to learn about the theory behind media but the readings can sometimes be very dense, and the lectures seemed to be more general around a topic rather than truly dissecting a reading page by page or idea by idea. ",

            "\u00a0A strength is that the guest speakers are interesting. The topics discussed in lecture are also interesting. A weakness is that many of the readings are very technical, making it hard to understand for people like me with no background in the media field. ",
            "\u00a0First of all, it shouldn't be at 9:25. They really struggled with attendance, especially because there is nothing about lecture attendance in the grade. The media philosophy is also quite dense at times and was tough to get through. However the section presentation and final paper were great. They were interesting to watch and fun to put together. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!! This course is really interesting and a great class even for people just interested in the topic, but not interested in taking Film and Media Studies as a major. Its also not too much work, especially for a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0It's a a prerequisite for film major, but the class does help you think about media in a different way. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would, but only if they were interested in the philosophy of media. I might also recommend it to someone that was interested in the technical side of media, but I would not to a student that had no interest in the subject at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but more to deep philosophical thinkers than the average student. I can see why this class is a pre-rec for the film major, but if I were to construct the curriculum I would leave it out. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. ",

            "\u00a0Yes pretty interesting introduction to media studies ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is a very good writing credit ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they were seriously committed to coming to the morning lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. It is a relatively easy writing credit. You have to write a 2 paragraph response every week and a final 10-page paper about a medium, nothing complicated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I know it's a requirement for film majors, but Professor Casetti is the one to take it with. When I could make it to class, it was great to listen to him. I'm not sure I got very much from the lectures though. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I think the readings and the profesor are amazing. So much to learn. But is definitely voluntary "
