            "\u00a0Learned a lot about FDI and about how to write pithy memos. But I'm not sure what skills we covered ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great understanding of how the global firms and governments (either host or home) interact among one another and the behaviors that can build on or destroy these relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the challenges that global firms case when choosing to invest abroad and the challenges that both less developed countries and the Washington consensus pose. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0This class gives a really deep and interesting insight into the world of foreign direct investment by large global corporations into developing countries. Professor LaP very engagingly explains the political, social, environmental, and economic implications of the complex interactions between the different players in this field. The class was very interesting and although challenging it was still very manageable for someone who does not have a lot of prior knowledge about this topic. "

            "\u00a0This is a very well prepared course. The amount of topics covered is satisfying and gives you a well-rounded knowledge of the class topic. Class participation between the professor and students is well balanced. I don't really feel there are any weakness as to how this course is given. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the Professor and how much he knows along with his availability to have office hours and help you. Course material and reading is very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Though the readings and cases were pretty interesting, I feel like we didn't learn much in class. At their best, seminars are an exchange of ideas in all directions. That was not the case for this course. The professor certainly has a wealth of knowledge about the subject, as he has both practiced and taught the subject matter for many decades. But instead of an exchange of knowledge it felt like whenever we answered questions we had to produce the exact answer that the professor had in his mind. with the exact wording with no room for interrogation or debate, like a constant game of \"what does the professor want to hear.\"  I just feel like the class was neither intellectually challenging nor engaging, and that does not seem like a good use of a Yale seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome course! Not sure if its being taught again but Id strongly recommend taking it if it is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is very interesting course and I believe it is worth taking even if you are not a Political Science major. The class topics open for debate during class are very interesting and help you open up your mental boundaries. This course holds topics that you certainly want to be familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Interesting topic, knowledgeable professor, and interesting case studies. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course! Professor LaP is an incredible, extremely knowledgeable professor whose clear and fascinating discussion of the topic, as well as his personal stories about his experiences with global firms, are really very interesting. The case study format of the class and the group presentations make it very engaging and the short essays give each student an opportunity to engage with the specific parts of the class that they finds personally interesting. The class trip to NYC to the Council on Foreign Relations was also an incredibly experience. I highly recommend this class. "
