            "\u00a0I learned how to read historical and political texts more critically which enabled me to understand subtext that I never would have seen before. It also opened my eyes to the rigors of academic interpretation (which often seems like sophistry to the uninitiated). ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking and analysis. Writing skills. Bridging concepts between works of different time periods. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking Directed Studies Historical and Political Thought, I improved upon my ability to read more efficiently and to write better primary source history papers. For the latter skill, I learned how to evaluate my own theses with a critical eye and how to clearly organize my papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to look at historical texts in a different way ; There was focus not only on context but stylistic methods the authors used. Paying attention to the style of authors was fascinating as it shed light on what they were saying through underlying ironies or emphases. ",
            "\u00a0We read some amazing authors that I truly enjoyed. I love DS and would not trade my first semester for anything. I learned that bridges between texts are crucial and must be made whenever possible. "

            "\u00a0Professor Thompson is the single greatest strength that the course could possibly have. She guides discussions with great skill and always knows when to step in and drop a mind-blowing fact.\r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting content. However, there is a lot of material to digest in a short amount of time. While it forces you to think deeply more quickly, there is the possibility to miss a lot as well. ",
            "\u00a0Excessive readings and little discussion. Discussion should have been better directed by the professor with more relevancy to modern life or more analysis of its contribution throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I loved taking this course with Professor Thompson. She is a very knowledgeable instructor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Firstly, I understand that the nature of the Directed Studies Program requires students to read many different texts quickly (which often means that we read excerpts of each work) but at times, I couldn't help but wish that we read fewer works and more of each work. Secondly, Directed Studies Historical and Political Thought is a unique blend of the two disciplines, but at times, it leaned more towards politics than history. While the Directed Studies lectures sometimes cover the historical context of a work, I wish that the Directed Studies lectures covered even more history to help students better contextualize the works. It would be even better if lectures could cover the history that happened between books (i.e., this year, we did not read Polybius, which had been on the syllabus for previous years, and it would be great if a lecture could briefly cover some of the historical context grounded in that text). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well structured, the latter authors often refer to the earlier ones and you see how many ideas are passed down through time. \r\nWeaknesses: Given the amount of readings assigned per week, only a small portion is discussed in class, and the rest is mostly forgotten until exams. The course does not explicitly cover the historical context of the works, instead relying on lectures and the students' own knowledge for that understanding. As this is a course on Historical and Political Thought, the context under which the doctrines and ideologies of political thinkers are conceived is extremely important but is sadly neglected. We also only read parts of many of the texts and I feel I am denied of the full experience for each piece of writing. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this course was the time spent in seminar. It was through discussion of the texts with an outstanding faculty member and a group of brilliant peers that I gained the most knowledge, skills, and insights. One of the weaknesses of this course seems to be clarity of the focus of the course as one on historical and political thought within the greater Directed Studies program. How to balance students' differences in understandings of the historical and political contexts of the works read with a dedication to a strong focus on the thought represented in the works is a challenge and was a difficulty I experienced. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the material, but the way the class itself was run was not great in my opinion. I disliked the starter concept because so much pressure was unnecessarily placed on that student. I felt like thids made the class competitive when it had no reason to be. It became more about sucking up then actually learning the material which I despised. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. It completely changed the way I looked at text. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Professor Thompson integrates the thoughts of different writers and thinkers in an often fascinating way. She does well to facilitate student discussion while also adding thoughts of her own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an amazing experience and there is a sense of completion and satisfaction with oneself once the course is over. Although you have to be dedicated, if the subject matter is of any relative interest, then it is enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Prof. Thompson is a gem, and is a fantastic example and teacher outside the classroom as well.  I loved every minute of her H/P section and was sad to see it end. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. It is misconstrued as a history course to students entering and provides little useful knowledge and almost no frame for discussion. Perhaps it would improve from an actual direction. The class meanders randomly without having any true direction or meaning. Take another class, you will learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the intersection between history and politics, who is willingly to put in the time and effort to complete readings and write papers, and who is looking for a rigorous academic experience. (However, I would warn that this is not the typical history course - for students who looking for a history course, this course has a particular emphasis on political history). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Even though personally I did not enjoy the political thinkers' readings as much as the historical accounts, but I was glad I read them regardless. If you have any interest in the Western Tradition, DS is almost a must-take. H&P is quite comprehensive and covers most of the western schools of thought and significant events leading up to the Middle Ages. The course really trains your critical thinking skills and you read many texts that you may not have otherwise read. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would, especially if that student expressed an interest in the subject and dedication to the heavy workload. I would also stress an interest in political thought as being particularly indicative that they would enjoy the course. However, if they are looking for a more traditional history class, this may not be for them. ",
            "\u00a0Its ok, but I feel that there might be better sections if that makes sense. "
