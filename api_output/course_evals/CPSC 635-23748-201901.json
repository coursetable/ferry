            "\u00a0I learned about the hardware software interface and things such as address translation and GPUs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a deep dive into the details of translation hardware, caches and similar structures in CPUs and GPUs. The course will teach you to be very familiar with address translation and virtual memory management, and you'll learn about recent advances in this field by reading papers. Abhishek was really good at iterating a few key questions/ facts throughout the class, which really helped reinforce these concepts. The undergraduates in this class also learned how to benchmarks native/ virtualized systems as well as GPUs. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor, very cool material. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was one of the best CS classes I have taken at Yale. The content seems very advanced at first, but the class does a fantastic job of bringing those who may have not taken the prereqs up to speed. Perhaps a few more assignments (even written problem sets instead of coding assignments) might have helped towards the beginning of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Abhishek is a great lecturer - he doesn't use slides, and the small class format where he was able to ask us questions and we would feel compelled to do the reading and answer was great.  We had an end-of-semester project which I really enjoyed because it felt like I was using what we learned in class to actually do research, which was fulfilling. \r\nWeaknesses - I wish there were a few more assignments, and paper presentations, because I learned a lot from presenting the paper and having the hands-on work, although for a graduate class, I think this was appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Immerse us with literature. Deep discussion.\r\n\r\nWeakness: could improve variety of topics. "

            "\u00a0YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor is one of the best in the department and is a super nice guy as well. Could not recommend more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. If you're a CS student who's unhappy about the current state of CS classes at Yale, please take this class. Abhishek is an excellent lecturer and really cares about his students. You will also realize what a poor job Yale's other system classes do- concepts we should have learned in OS or 323 kept coming up in class, and sadly, most of the undergraduates in this class were not familiar with some of these, despite having taken a good number of systems classes at Yale. The good news is that Abhishek is very willing to go over these concepts in class again, and simplify them enough for you to understand the topic being discussed. The workload of the class was also very manageable, and the final projects turned out to be very interesting to work on. Abhishek also cares a lot about the current state of the CS department, and is always open to ideas from students about what they should be doing better, so take this class and help him improve the CS department in general! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Abhishek is an excellent lecturer and any class you'll take with him will be great. He also cares so much about making Yale CS better, and he took a lot of time to talk to us about our experiences. He doesn't use slides, so I actually felt like I learned things that I was supposed to learn in classes like OS in this class. The only issue I had with this class is that at times, it seems a bit too focused on address translation, and I wish we had spent more time studying GPUs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good dive into architecture literature. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you have any interest at all in systems, this is an excellent class. Abhishek is the best professor I've had at Yale: he cares deeply about his students and his teaching, and also he's just a fun, genuine, and empathetic dude. You definitely don't want to miss the chance to take his class.\r\n\r\nIn terms of content, you'll learn a lot about computer architecture from this course. It's great for review of content from 323 or operating systems; the teaching in those classes can be quite abstract, but in CPSC 635 the material is given a broader context that helps you understand why it's actually important. The class moves at a perfectly brisk pace; it's not too slow but also not too fast. And the project is a great way to grow your knowledge of the content. I'd definitely recommend this class. "
