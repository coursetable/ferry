            "\u00a0Excellent course, good deep-dive into theory behind evaluation and guidance on how to develop and implement an evaluation ",
            "\u00a0Overall I felt like the course was a fantastic tangible experience in program evaluation. The hands on work with actually creating an evaluation as well as critiquing other plans (both our own peers and a \"professional\" evaluation) were excellent exercises that left me feeling equipped to potentially go into a professional setting and feel competent in terms of where to start and what to be thinking about. However, at times the reading was tedious and expectations were simply unrealistic in terms of what we as students could manage to get done on that front. I think it would be more effective to have fewer readings that students are able to dive into more deeply rather than scratch the surface of several lengthy pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the first guest lecturer and modules on ethics. Some of the content rooted in theory was complex; while the individual assignment helped with my understanding, I think a group assignment in class related to that content might have been useful as well.\r\n\r\nBetter structure of course materials in canvas would have been helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you'll learn everything you need to know about evaluation, including the background and theory, as well as the tools you should use to carry out an evaluation. Kathleen does a great job going through the material in a way that builds upon what you're learning each week, which corresponds to your project at the same time.\r\nWeaknesses: the way the canvas website was set up was challenging to find the corresponding readings or assignment materials for that week. At times the readings were dense, but useful. Group work always has it's challenges. Most of all, getting additional feedback from the instructor would have been helpful earlier on (around the class critique week) so that groups had enough time to make changes before the final. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite courses at YSPH! I find the skills I have learned in this class very useful and can see myself applying them in my career. It was also great to have had the opportunity to work with a community based organization on a project that could potentially be useful for them. The course is highly interactive; there was a variety of class activities and guest lecturers throughout the semester, so I was able to be more engaged in the class versus doing the same things over. I also appreciate that Prof. Duffany created plenty of opportunities to receive feedback for our project throughout the semester (we got feedback for our first draft from Prof. Duffany and Sophie, then feedback from peers, and Prof. Duffany again in our presentation).  I thought it was important that we constantly refined our draft, given the context of working with community members. ",
            "\u00a0A course that all students of public health should take. Program evaluation is an important component of the field and I am grateful to have had an extensive introduction to the topic in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I felt that I put a lot of time into the course and was able to gain a lot out of it. I learned a lot. The course is very thorough, at the end of the course I felt equipped to conduct an evaluation myself! Kathleen really helped facilitate learning and she pushed us as an instructor, in a very helpful way. I also really liked the way the course was set up, with guest speakers, dynamic discussions, and different topics... Even though each class was two hours I always felt it went by fast because we often did multiple activities in one session.  \r\nWeaknesses - There was sometimes a lack of organization and clarity regarding due dates, instructions for assignments, canvas site (quite confusing).... It would also take a while to receive feedback/our grade back even when another assignment would be due (making it hard to incorporate feedback into the new assignment) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly practical - I love that we are working with the local community.\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any right now ",
            "\u00a0overall good. only recommendation would be to provide timely feedback throughout whole course on each assignment ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much! I loved my group, they were amazing ladies! I also really enjoyed and learned so much from Kathleen, Sophie and the rest of the class! These are skills Im already utilizing and can definitely see myself using in the future! ",
            "\u00a0strengths: provides a unity of theory and real-world application at the same time.  Most YSPH courses do not do this all at once. \r\nweaknesses: feels a little disorganized in terms of what we are supposed to grasp within each lecture.  I think the slideshows could be better organized, or have more information on them?  Sometimes the readings didn't feel so unified with what was presented in class, sometimes they did. \r\n\r\nIt was great to have guest speakers as well!  I appreciated the opportunity to learn from many different professors and to have a broader discussion.  This class was definitely the most interactive I've had at YSPH.  Moving the tables definitely helped! :) ",
            "\u00a0This course was equipped students with theory and practical skills for conducting program evaluations. I especially enjoyed guest speakers and room for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided valuable evaluation tools that will be useful to me in my practice-based public health work. I appreciated the discussion of the ethics of evaluation, and the willingness to let me complete a nontraditional project. "

            "\u00a0Kathleen is wonderful, her enthusiasm is infectious and she created a warm, open learning environment for all of the students. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Duffany is clearly devoted to helping students develop the skills that they need to be great evaluators. She was always willing to go the extra mile to discuss challenges and champion successes, and I felt that her constructive criticism skills were so helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen is wonderful and provided incredibly thorough feedback on our draft of our final group paper. She goes above and beyond offering time to review things in great detail. Office hours were great! ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen is one of the best professors you could take a class with while at YSPH. She keeps a fun and engaging class, pushes students to think critically, and covers a great amount of material in a way that helps students with a variety of learning preferences engaged. The way she designed this course is fantastic, as each week students are able to learn new elements of evaluation that will help them continue to build their semester-long project.\r\nThe only critique would be offering additional feedback on the plan drafts earlier in the second half of the semester so groups have sufficient time to make the necessary changes.\r\nOverall, Kathleen was amazing to learn from. She's focused on students' learning rather than strict deadlines. She has a very open-door policy which really helped students have access to ask follow-up questions or meet to discuss their projects. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Duffany is definitely passionate about program evaluation! It was clear that she cared about our performance and wanted to help us produce a quality evaluation plan. She was also creative in her teaching styles; class activities varied lecture by lecture and I never felt bored or zoned out in class. She also provided students with a lot of opportunities to receive feedback from her, which was nice. I wish though that her instructions for assignments were clearer sometimes, especially for the first draft of the evaluation. I understand that we had to write the first draft early so that we could have feedback early and budget our time wisely over the semester, but I also think more instructions for that assignment, given that it was given after just a few weeks of classes, would be nice! But overall, I enjoyed having Prof. Duffany as my instructor for the course, and I have learned a lot from her. ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen is really wonderful: she is thorough, passionate about her work, and invested in making sure the class is useful to all students. Happy to have taken a class with her! ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen was a great instructor and very knowledgeable! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very communicative and intelligent\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any right now ",
            "\u00a0Amazing. Shes a star and wonderful, intelligent, understanding, patient and brilliant professor and I am so happy I had the opportunity to be in her class! ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen is clearly passionate about teaching and in encouraging students to do their best!  She makes herself more available than any other professor I have had, which is greatly appreciated.  It definitely led to a more conducive learning environment, knowing that we could feel comfortable going to her with any question. \r\nThe teaching might be improved by thinking more through what each element of the course adds to the overall message.  Each unit was clearly thought out, of course, but the sort-of 'sub-units' felt a little disorganized.  For example, when we discussed theories of behavior change, there were many other concepts explored within that slideshow and I had trouble organizing the ideas in my mind.  Its the kind of situation where you understand it all while you're listening in class, but then when you go back you have trouble finding the thread that links all the ideas together. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how invested the instructor was in the course content and students. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing! Great at giving timely feedback, and seemed to be genuinely invested in the growth of her students in knowledge of program evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Duffany was supportive, approachable, available to her students, and encouraged critical engagement with in-depth questions facing evaluators. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best professors are YSPH. Kathleen is dedicated to her work and truly believes in her students. She is a wealth of knowledge and students should access her outside the classroom to soak up of her teachings. "

            "\u00a0This course is a very practical course for people who want to learn how to evaluate public health initiatives so if that is an interest of yours, this is a good choice. ",
            "\u00a0If you are someone who wants to work in programming in any capacity, this course is a must. Although tedious at times in terms of workload, the information gained is so practical! I also now feel like I have an \"evaluation mentor\" in Professor Duffany in the event that I ever have questions in the future professionally. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would not have taken this course if it wasn't required; that said, the group project allowed me to get to know fellow classmates a lot better, which I think will be useful for future professional pursuits. If you're interested in program evaluation as a career this is a great class to take as you design a program evaluation from scratch (and if you're not, it's still really practical content to add to your public health toolkit!). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course if you're interested in learning how to construct evaluations for public health interventions or programs. You get the chance to work with an organization in real life to help them in evaluating one of their programs, so this course has very real-life practical components. You'll learn best practices, theory, as well as hard skills. A great class to put what you have learned into practice. ",
            "\u00a0I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to people who are interested in gaining tangible skills in community-based work or being engaged with the community. The class definitely challenges you to think critically about program evaluation and applying skills/concepts you have learned from core public health courses at YSPH to create something tangible and potentially helpful for the community! ",
            "\u00a0In this course, you learn about program evaluation and even get to develop an evaluation plan yourself! Definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to learn about evaluation in a comprehensive manner! ",
            "\u00a0A class on designing a program evaluation \r\nYes I would recommend it to other students because you learn how to design a program thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course! Its a lot of work and you will be working hard and will have to work in depth with your group, so better like them. I think everyone should take this class and gain evaluation skills. Theyre super relevant to not only our field but most fields. ",
            "\u00a0I think any student could benefit from this course--evaluation should always be a part of any public health professionals' considerations.  The course uses both theory and technique as tools to wield when developing evaluations.  This is often missing from other Yale courses, so I think students felt particularly happy about that.  This was probably the most engaging and fun class I had at YSPH!  It is not easy, but that is because you are learning a great deal in a short amount of time.  It is almost entirely group work, so that influences the class as well of course. I've also spoken about a lot of what we learned during job interviews, so its been quite immediately useful in that way too... ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if the student does not plan to directly apply evaluation methods in their future career, the information learned is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in practice-based work, and would say it would provide a concrete overview to the evaluation process and provide tools for future public health work. "
