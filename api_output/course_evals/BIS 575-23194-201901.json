Each class was different and more in depth than could have been hoped for at the outset.

However, there was no flow to the lectures, and I honestly don't feel like I left the class having learned very much. The guest lectures were fine, but I think there were too many.

At the same time, you will learn a tremendous amount about how regulatory affairs work - mainly through the speakers that Dr. Makuch invites throughout the semester. These are industry experts, and Dr. Makuch has a personal relationship with each and every one of them. This allows for lots of candid discussions, real-world observations, and real-time interactions that really expose how things work in regulatory affairs. "
