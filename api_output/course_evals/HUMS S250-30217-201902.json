            "\u00a0Professor Jewiss taught us how to read a city through different layers of its history. We learned not only about the monuments, churches, and museums of Rome but also how to engage with the city and learn from observation and inquiry. Through writing assignments, I improved my writing skills to connect the texts we read to the things we were experiencing in Rome. This class taught me to be more curious about the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to read the materiality of a city and how to ask questions and seek answers from the physical surrounding. ",
            "\u00a0I engaged with the physical city of Rome and learned how to read the architecture of buildings as well as art history and religion. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in making connections between different disciplines and different types of readings, including art history, literature, architecture, archaeology, and more. I learned how to trace course themes through many different time periods and areas of content as well as use observational analysis and synthesis to guide my learning. ",
            "\u00a0A ton of knowledge about history art architecture and the city in of Rome. Truly interdisciplinary. Radically altered how I see cities, art, history, architecture. Pretty much changed my life and what I want to do with it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the recourses available to me to make connections. Instead of looking at a building or statue and having no idea what it meant, this class taught me how to notice details and make discoveries even when I thought I had hit a dead end. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to read a city! This course puts art history, architecture, politics, theology, literature, and so much more together in the most rewarding way possible. I see Rome everywhere now. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in-depth understanding of the history of Rome and the components that contribute to its lasting impact. From reading classic authors such as Virgil I acquired knowledge of the almost mythological aspect that the foundation of the empire was built on. I gained skills of how to independently become accustomed to a new place and how to navigate through a foreign city. "

            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is of course that it is only five weeks and we have so much material to cover. It would be great if the course was longer! ",
            "\u00a0The on site teaching methodology of the class was effective in helping us connect what we have been reading to the physical structure of Rome, and trace its development from antiquity to modernity week by week. It felt a little rushed though - the course could be longer. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it allowed students to closely interact with the city itself instead of just being in a classroom all day. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows you to see and understand as much of Rome as possible in the condensed time period. I learned about Rome through over 2000 years of its history and did so through traveling to and observing sites all across the city. The course could be improved with more clear guidelines about expectations for the weekly assignments and clearer end times on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Rome!!! Fascinating in every which way possible!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings sometimes were very heavy on a given day and very light on others, wouldve liked more spacing, but I get its tough when certain readings can only apply to certain days ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that it pushed the students to do lots of work and think creatively and critically. However a weakness was that the amount we had to cover in 5 weeks took away from the engagement with each unit as we were forced to rush things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very immersive and rewarding if you work hard. Weaknesses: so many readings that you have to skim some and miss some things ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the explorative aspect, where the class would have onsite lecturers by professors who specifically studied the lesson's subject. The weaknesses of the course pertained to the workload and the amount of time given to complete the work. After a day of walking nearly ten miles, there would be little energy left to complete a large reading assignment. There was little time for breaks, leaving us all exhausted. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Everyone should take this course! You will learn so much in this class and Rome is such a great city to learn from. This class challenges you to engage with the themes and ideas of the course in a way different from all other Yale classes. If you are looking for an unforgettable and amazing way to spend your summer, this class is for you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its one of those courses that changes the way you perceive the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to someone who was already very interested in the subject matter. For people who do not want to spend five weeks straight only doing work and research, this course is not appropriate. However, for someone who wants to spend a lot of time exploring the city from a historical/intellectual perspective, this course is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course, as long as the student is prepared to put in a good amount of effort and work. You will gain a lot out of the course if you treat it as if you are taking a class during the academic year and not just as a fun summer abroad experience. It was overwhelming at times, but I felt like I learned a ton and the on-site classes, discussions, and guest lectures were all very high quality. It is an amazing experience to learn about Rome in so many varied facets while being there and getting to see so much of the city. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - incredible opportunity to spend summer in the Eternal City! This was the best academic experience Ive had at Yale and a once in a lifetime opportunity to truly get to know Rome. This is a must-take course. It will change how you see the world, no joke! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student but I would warn them that it is incredibly exhausting. The walking around Rome is not only physically draining, but when you get back to your room the amount of readings expected to be done was absolutely unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn how it is possible to engage with a location in a very engaging and rewarding way ",
            "\u00a0I would, because traveling and exploring Rome is an incredible experience; however, I would warn them of the heavy workload. They would have to be passionate about the subject and willing to experience a class onsite instead of a summer abroad exploring the country. "
