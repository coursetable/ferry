The disconnect between the outside world and our mental representations of it is particularly important to become aware of. ",

The class keeps you on your toes. \r\nComing into CogSci blind having no knowledge of the material, I feel like I've learned a lot, from perception, to modularity, to how animals teaches about our own cognition, and so on. Lectures were informative, challenging, and fun. ",

In one semester, you basically learn some introductory linguistics, introductory philosophy, introductory behavioral economics, introductory psychology, and introductory neuroscience. Every day, my mind was fascinated about itself; the mind is a beautifully complicated thing that you get to learn more about in this class! ",

He wastes the first 10 minutes of class setting up and then complains at the end of class that we don't have enough time and keeps us late when I have a section to go to on science hill. Additionally, a lot of what we covered was very surface level and many things not described well. Brian Scholl should take his class more seriously. ",

We started off with foundational knowledge like mind modularity, the evolution of the mind, instinct blindness, and cognitive architecture, then moved on to broader \"applications\" of cognitive science in the real world from infant cognition to linguistics to the cognitive science of love, sex, and attraction. The weekly articles we had to read and respond to also taught me how to be a more diligent consumer of scientific text. Overall, I learned quite a bit! ",

It showed me how we are a combination of nature and nurture. By showing the ways in which human minds are systematically good or bad at, it helped me look at people more empathetically. It helped me look at issues of morality in a different way I never thought was possible. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about a lot of answers to questions I didnt know I didnt know. That was perhaps the biggest takeaway for me- carving the mind at its joints, many of which were previously unknownst at to me. In a way, this gave voice to a lot of curiosities I already had, but was never able to explore in a structured and productive manner. ",

More than anything, I gained a new perspective, as the course focused on the mind as a computer -- optimized by evolutionary history and performing with flawed efficiency.

            "\u00a0The course is organized well and in a fashion where nothing was boring. The only weakness is that the number of readings is too excessive to be able to read everything, but the tests make up for this with skips (which I used on reading-related questions). ",
            "\u00a0This course was very disjointed and thinly spread. It is a \"mile wide, inch deep course\" by design, which I understand as a weakness. Lectures were fascinating and every day introduced new material, but internalizing that material was difficult because of its superficial nature. Furthermore readings were long, dense, and sometimes incomprehensible. Combined with the fact that there is no textbook for the course, this complicated the studying process, as all information -- regardless of how complicated, or whether or not it was from the reading or lecture -- was fair game. \r\n\r\nThere was a very steep disconnect between Professor Scholl and the TFs of the class. Before the first exam, I asked a question to my TF and was given a completely wrong answer that lost me points on multiple questions and thus harmed my grade. Often I felt like the TFs did not know the course material, and were far more confused than the students. \r\n\r\nMost of our readings came from Professor Scholl's research. It is impossible to gain an objective understanding of an emerging field when only looking at one man's understanding, and Professor Scholl did little to increase our knowledge of other researchers and ideas besides his.

However, some of the exam questions and the essay topic were rather vague, and it was hard to really understand what was being asked and what is useful to know. The lectures were often falling behind as well since Scholl often went on tangents. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of this class is its lectures; the material is well-covered and easy to follow, as well as interesting because Scholl uses multi-media presentations to teach and keep your engagement. The other strength is its guest lectures, by Scaz, Josh Knobe, and HoC Santos; after each of these guest lectures, I felt a powerful inspiration to continue with cognitive science, because these guest lecturers show you beautiful things that this field can do (like how robots + cognitive science can be used to teach deaf children to speak ASL, for example). \r\n\r\nA weakness of this class is the correlation between material and homework, and then the midterm and final. For the first midterm, I felt well-prepared having studied all the lectures and done all of the readings. However, the questions on the exam can be tricky because they require  applications of the information you learn in class. Thus, I think it'd be cool to have some sort of practice questions or some sort of activity that allows you to practice application questions before the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of interesting material. However, a lot of time wasted in the class. 10-20 minutes at the beginning of each class is used for logistics that could be addressed in an email. The tests are also graded so formulaically that they often test your ability to memorize Scholl's wording of a concept more than one's actual understanding of the concept. ",

My TA was not helpful at all though, so thank God I was taking this Credit-D or my GPA would have plummeted. Also, the reading responses we had twice a week were quite excessive and painful. ",

Review sessions were well conducted for tests, and all information was made easily accessible. The only thing I would say is that the slides posted online were very incomplete, so for people like me who take notes by hand without the slides, it was sometimes hard to go back and study exactly what Scholl had taught us.

It is a weakness because you never have enough time to go deeper into areas and topics.

Often the organization was hard to follow, which made studying for the exams quite difficult. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the review sessions led by the TAs before the exams proved that the class was so poorly organized, even they didn't know what was going on. There must have been little communication with Professor Scholl because when legitimate questions that were asked during review sessions, the TAs often did not know the answer, told us it would not be important, and then those exact questions were asked on the test where we were graded extremely harshly and expected to know specific details that the TAs clearly had not known during any reviews.

Exams were fair, if a bit tailored to Brian's exact wording of concepts, but if you take good notes in class this shouldn't be a problem. As for weaknesses, there aren't a lot of opportunities to assess what knowledge you've retained. Lectures felt like fun TED talks, with exams as reluctantly necessary afterthoughts.

The grade is made up of those and participation from the reading responses you submit every Monday and Wednesday based on the reading that is assigned. The readings are fairly helpful and responses are straightforward to do. The midterm material is quite random, and based on random things focused on in class. If you're a senior, make sure you don't have interviews or have to be out of town on any day this lecture is offered. Otherwise, you will fail the midterm.

This course can be best described as a collection of useful tidbits or facts about various topics. Understandably, this is an introduction to cognitive science, but I see the insane breadth as a drawback. We covered everything from principles of cognitive architecture, to Turing machines, to language and phrase markers, to robotics, to animal cognitionafter a while it all started to lack meaning. \r\n\r\nA side-effect of this breadth is that it makes the entire field look a little pseudosciency. In one of our last lectures, Prof. Scholl deplored just-so explanations that explain the obvious. But it seemed that we were routinely utilizing just-so explanations to explain away otherwise interesting problems and phenomena. For instance, visual illusions were accounted for by jargon such as coincidence avoidance and instinct blindness without any strict separation between the two. Similarly, the behavior of ants and bees was attributed to instances of dead-reckoning and chemo-signaling without much elaboration. This continued into the rest of the course, and I would have liked to see on increased focus on computer science and neuroscience.\r\n\r\nBut the course does have some positives: As previously stated, Prof. Scholl is a rare, charismatic and comedic lecturer, so its hard to fall asleep. The reading responses are pretty much graded pass/pass. You can get away with skimming the readings, since whats more important is taking detailed notes in class.

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Professor Scholl can focus too much on being funny, rather than presenting the material in a clear, coherent manner. There are a lot of individual experiments that are showcased, yet not much information on basic definitions and concepts to better explain the experiments. ",

",

            "\u00a0CogSci is a course that really is what you make of it. The weekly workload is fairly small (the reading responses honestly aren't that bad) which means that some students lower their guard a bit too much--getting blindsided during the exams. If you actually pay attention in lecture and do the responses, the course is pretty easy. Also Professor Scholl is a great lecturer, who always finds a way to bring fun into the material. ",
            "\u00a0This class was everything that I wanted from an introductory course--it was fun, not too much work, interactive, fascinating, and very interesting. I never once fell asleep in lecture (Scholl is a very animated lecturer who always keeps you on your toes with his (sometimes distasteful but hilarious regardless) jokes), which is more than I can say for most classes. One of my favorite things about this class is that everything we learn can be directly applied and observed in real life; everything we learn changes a fraction of my perception of the world. \"A common man marvels at uncommon things. A wise man marvels at common things\" was a quote we were shown in the very first lecture. This class definitely taught me how to marvel at common things and to subsequently see the beauty and complexity of all the little things around me. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend because the class covers topics that wouldn't be covered in any other class such as the innateness of language.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a first-year who is still going to laugh at Professor Scholl's jokes, probably has a lot of friends in the class to share study materials, and hasn't taken Psych 110 (it overlaps so much that Cog Sci is made a bit dull). Personally, I would recommend taking the intro classes in all the things Cog Sci touches on: Linguistic, Stat, Psych, CPSC, Phil, but since that takes a lot of time, Cog Sci is a decent introduction to those areas. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you have any interest in cognitive science, whether as a major or not, take this course (especially with Brian). Low stress, fun lecture, and a springboard to interesting future studies. Great course for your first semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Cognitive Science to students who are interested in psychology's intersection with many other disciplines, with the caveat that there is more breadth involved in the course than depth, and not as much structure. ",

If you are interested in computer science and artificial intelligence, the course might be somewhat more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The class structure isn't formatted in a way that is easily/universally understood, as an intro class should be. It's for a very specific kind of learner. The grading is also really strange; students in the dark about their performance throughout the semester.

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely take it! ",
            "\u00a0Decent course. About 20 minutes (or less) of important stuff in each lecture, pretty much. If you keep up with the notes and know what is important and what isn't, you'll do well. The important stuff is what Scholl talks about a lot. Some people like Scholl, some people don't. I found him kind of annoying. It's a pretty chill SO credit though, if you need one. Not like an incredible class filled with incredible learning tho, ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured fairly well, with the lectures usually posted before class begins. The lectures are clear and understandable. It would be great if the lectures posted online contained all the graphic images and content that is seen in class. It's hard to catch up on a lecture if you miss a class and have to rely on these vague PDFs. The course has 2 midterms, and 1 paper. The grade is made up of those and participation from the reading responses you submit every Monday and Wednesday based on the reading that is assigned. The readings are fairly helpful and responses are straightforward to do. The midterm material is quite random, and based on random things focused on in class. If you're a senior, make sure you don't have interviews or have to be out of town on any day this lecture is offered. Otherwise, you will fail the midterm. Take notes on everything, because you will never really know what will be on the exam. Concepts are key to know, but its hard to know from the lectures the definite answer to some questions. It may be best to take this class credit D. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in cognitive science or any of its subdisciplines. The class moves really quickly from one subject to the next, but since Professor Scholl introduces you to so many topics, at least a few of them are bound to interest you. The lectures are engaging and the workload is not strenuous. ",

The coconuts were very intriguing and they were fun to learn about however it took someones a lot of studying in order to truly understand the concepts. ",

Professor Scholl does a great job, and even though you don't walk away feeling like an expert in cognitive science, you do learn a lot about a lot of different, useful things. It's not too much work, though you do actually have to study for the midterm and final and put some effort into the final paper, and it's actually fun to go to each class and learn about something interesting.

            "\u00a0Brian's lecture is a force of nature. Fitting that a cog sci professor would be able in a less-than-purely-metaphorical way to reach into the minds of hundreds of students and materialize the exact crystalline structure of a certain difficult concept. Brian's lab is called Perception; his lecture should be called Inception: you will leave lecture with an understanding and conviction that tends to come only when you yourself have made the groundbreaking discovery after years of toil. Don't ever let anyone say, \"I can't explain this to you, it's too complicated\" - I had a better conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics (relevant for fMRI imaging) after Brian's 2-minute overview than after my first two QM lectures last semester.\r\n\r\nOk, back to earth with this rec. I am a junior computer science major who took the class for an SO credit. Tough grading visa-vie peers who are more cog-sci focused (I worked reasonably hard and am around a B). Would recommend due to very profound material that is hilariously well explicated by Brian. ",

There are reading responses due before every class but they are basically graded for completion and only have to be a paragraph long. The exams aren't too difficult...it's just hard to know what's going to be on them. ",

Overall, this is one of the classes I loved going to everyday and I actually looked forward to it. The topic matter is interesting and Brian is an amazing lecturer, super interesting guy, and adds comedy to his lectures making them very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0If you've already taken other psychology/neuroscience/linguistics courses, cogsci will definitely be easier for you (but its a requirement for the cogsci major, so you still have to take it even if you've taken more advanced courses in cogsci). If you're an upperclassman looking for an Social Science credit, you could definitely find other classes that would be more interesting. But I would recommend intro cogsci to first semester freshmen. \r\n\r\nBeware, the exams are harder than expected because the multiple choice questions are quite specific. Other than studying for exams, this course doesnt require much work, but lectures are still engaging. You definitely need to go to class bc lecture slides are very minimal and wont be useful unless you go to class ",
