            "\u00a0As someone with no prior experience in art or painting, I emerged from the class with skills and knowledge in painting far beyond what I had expected. I learned a number of skills related to painting still lives, how to properly prepare and use oil paints, and how to create my own canvasses. I now feel comfortable purchasing painting materials and starting my own projects, and I hope to retain painting as a hobby in the future. ",
            "\u00a0How to use oil paints, mixing medium, stretching and gessoing canvases ",
            "\u00a0I learned about basic painting skills and developed my artistic style. I also became more skilled in painting techniques, such as which mediums to use. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to paint with oil paints for the first time. Learned how to paint with a different perspective through still life subjects. "

        [
            "\u00a0Although I've enjoyed every assignment and there was more flexibility towards the end, I wished we didn't confine ourselves to painting still life all semester. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had had more time for the final, seeing as it required twice the work of our normal assignments. Otherwise, I felt the course was well structured, and the instruction was informative and helpful. I especially loved our visits to the YUAG, as they helped me learn to interpret and better appreciate painting as an art form. ",
            "\u00a0Its a very fun and relaxed class. We spent most of the time in class painting still-lifes and sometimes we would critique our projects or go to the YUAG to talk about paintings. I like how color was introduced gradually; we started off with black and white and we did many two-tone paintings before using a full palette. The only weakness Id say is that there isnt much opportunity to paint things that arent still-lifes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was the high level of teaching. I enjoyed the opportunity evaluate paintings alongside my class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we were able to do a little more creative assignments than just still life studies. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend taking this course with Troy Michie. He was a great instructor, always keeping class fun and engaging. His instruction helped me go from someone with no art or painting experience to being comfortable with a paintbrush and proud of the work I produced. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you want a relaxing, fun class. Its definitely better for beginners who might not have oil painted before. If youre not a beginner, if might feel slow and boring at some points. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. I think it is a great fundamental course for anyone interested in painting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a very relaxing and fun class to take. I've learned a lot that I can apply to my painting outside of class. "
