            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. I felt that the structure and organization of the course was perfect. The assignments were very clear and scheduled throughout the semester. The workload definitely built up towards the end of the semester but I felt that it wasn't too much. I also enjoyed the end of the semester presentations where we could see the preliminary results of many of the projects we had heard about all semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good and thorough introduction to qualitative methods. I think it would have been really helpful for our learning and processing of the methodology if had more peer-review and discussion, especially for individual output 1. ",
            "\u00a0This is hands down the most brilliant course I've taken at YSPH, and one of the best courses I've taken in my academic career. It's perfectly structured to the layout of the academic semester, providing ample opportunity during class time to work on group projects so you're not spending time outside of class coordinating schedules and scrambling to get things done. Breaking up assignments week-by-week was great. Expectations never felt unmanageable.  \r\n\r\nMore importantly all of the tangible skills I've learned are incredibly applicable to my future work. Moving forward I feel incredibly confident in my ability to design a qualitative research study and write a paper suitable for publishing.\r\n\r\nHonestly zero weaknesses. I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0Liked the class time to work on projects in groups ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was an excellent introduction to qualitative skills (coding, interviewing, etc.). Dr. Keene was a passionate, expert lecturer. This course is work heavy - our final report was 50+ pages, and our individual assignments mid-year (with coded interviews, memos, etc.) were over 50+ pages as well. But Dr. Keene and the TFs responding in a timely and helpful manner to our assignments they were also present in class/after class to help address our concerns. The course is well structured, but has a lot of little assignments that are due every week (this might not be appealing to some students). Furthermore, the class has individual assignments that are due frequently, and although the dates are clearly marked when things were due, the volume of material due might put some students off/confuse them. It certainly keeps you on your toes. The opportunity to interview community members (and get IRB approval, like our group did, for possible future publication), was INCREDIBLE and really leads you step by step through the qualitative process (from designing surveys, creating methodology, getting IRB approval, interviewing, etc.). In this way, this class provided a practicum-like experience to gain an in depth introduction to qualitative methods. Danya's lectures were interesting, relevant, and conversational  I would highly recommend this course and this instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is an incredible course. Danya is amazing. It was a little stressful to get all of the interviews done on time, but I learned so much from this calss. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course in terms of content and the skills gained- in fact, I'm already implementing a lot of the skills either in other courses or in outside research and it's been so helpful! I thought that the material was super engaging and the practical application of what we were learning really cemented the concepts. I also really enjoyed towards the end of the course when we were introduced to guest speakers in other fields of qualitative research. The downfall of the course would be the lack of accountability in the team-based assignments (group outputs, presentation, final report). Nearly the entirety of work fell onto a couple people while others literally just did not care. This was frustrating and continued despite attempts internally to try and increase accountability. ",
            "\u00a0As someone more interested in the quantitative aspect of public health, I was a bit wary of the course. However, this class gave me a new appreciation for qualitative research and I had a lot of fun with the semester project. I think I learned the most from this course than any other course I have taken this semester. I feel like the skills I learned from this course can be transferred to public health practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: gives good overview on qualitative methods, provides several examples of what is expected of students\r\n\r\nWeakness: none really, I think this course meets its goals ",
            "\u00a0The courses professor is a great instructor, and clearly cares a lot about her students and teaching. However, the material/substance of the course is extremely elementary, and there is a lot of unnecessary and time-consuming busy work. The course should not be listed as a requirement for doctoral students. ",
            "\u00a0This was the BEST course I have taken at YSPH. I have gained tangible skills and am proud that our group was able to complete such a quality qualitative project over the course of the semester. I would recommend this course to any student and will take the skills with me into my future career. ",
            "\u00a0Very good. I learned a lot and it is very applicable to the real world. It was good to learn from fellow students. ",
            "\u00a0Individual assessment 2 could have been assigned earlier so we could focus more on our group paper near the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the qualitative project and I have learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very practical and thorough.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think people should use this in conjunction with other projects (i.e. dissertations) because their work may end up taking a different shape. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was an amazing course that laid the foundation for qualitative research. I really saw no weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor and content of this course were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great material that inspired new projects and directions relevant for my research. Honed previously learned skills. I wish more time was spent on the data analysis. Although I understand this is only an intro course, the hardest past is the data analysis and too little time is spent there. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too broad. Only superficially cover each methodology. An advanced version or a year long course would be great for individuals looking to use this professionally as well as PhD students. \r\n\r\nOther weaknesses of the course load: the final 2-3 weeks of the course had too many assignments back-to-back. The article criticism seemed like extra work that was not very informative to my learning experience. I would have prefer for this to be optional (for extra credit) or assigned the month prior when work load was less. Between finishing up a presentation, data analysis and writing a paper, students are super overwhelmed at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I felt the pacing was adequate, especially considering the scale of most of the group projects and the limited time period in which to conduct everything. The concepts taught in class and discussed by guest speakers were interesting and discussions were engaging. The class really made good use of the time available.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n-interesting and engaging subject matter and topics; really enjoyed the discussions about quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods work and enjoyed discussing the methods of current well-known ethnographic and semi-qualitative works such as 'On the Run' and 'Evicted'\r\n-all the projects were fascinating and it was great to hear about the findings and culmination of everyone's projects, and to hear that many, if not all, of them are intending to take those projects further, it really helped to round out the course and show the ongoing nature of qualitative study \r\n-the instructor and TFs were great and very helpful and supportive; their feedback was timely and really helped our group's project along\r\n-the examples of outputs and final assignments were great and really helpful  \r\n-setting aside time for group meetings at the end of class on Thursday was really appreciated\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-doing more small group discussions may help to encourage more input and discussion from all students; I enjoyed the small group discussions when they did occur and I think it really helps to hear different voices and perspectives, which are not always heard during whole class discussions ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. It does not have any weaknesses, in my opinion. I feel very strong about constructing a qualitative research project from beginning to end. The preliminary research question development to analytical skills gained in this experience were incredible. This class was intensive, but well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fantastic, in-depth immersion into designing and conducting high quality qualitative research. Theory and readings were paired expertly with assignments. Assignments also made a lot of chronological sense, and all contributed to the final project, which was great. The instructor and TFs supplied in-depth feedback on each assignment, and there was always opportunity to re-work. This class was comprehensive and I can't think of a single way that it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent. Well laid out and everything flowed well ",
            "\u00a0Qualitative Research Methods is the best course I took in my first year at YSPH. This course is tough and time-consuming, but I came away with solid skills in qualitative methods and a sound understanding of the theory behind qualitative research. The classroom environment fostered great discussion and Danya is an engaging and incredibly knowledgable instructor! I do think the course could benefit from a restructuring of assignment due dates. For instance, I wonder if final presentations could be during finals week to spread out the last few group outputs and give us more time for analysis, group discussion, etc. -- but that could be a very personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course, really well designed. Would love for an advanced qualitative methods course ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was fantastic! It provided us with an opportunity to complete a mini research project that applied the skills we were learning about qualitative analysis. \r\n\r\nStrengths: numerous examples via readings and past students' works, interesting and non-clear cut discussions of ethics regarding qualitative projects, engagement with other teams' projects which provided increased moral support ( something I feel YSPH needs more of!), the involvment of students outside of YSPH (allowed us to have more interprofessional interactions)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: .... can't think of any!

The course ensures that students are close to their projects and their participants as well as the narrative of their participants. I recommend it to every student who wishes to do studies with human subjects as qualitative data is vastly underutilized and is one of the only mechanisms to deeply understand a patient's perspective.
