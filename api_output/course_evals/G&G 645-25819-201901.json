Thus, I have developed numerous insights that potentially enable me to independently explore further those topics that are relevant for my research. The course also included three sessions aimed at developing actual research skills (stats, database use), although these are introductory in nature. "

",
            "\u00a0I think 30 minutes of lecture per week to either prepare us for the next week's readings or reinforce that week's topic would have been valuable. As it was, the discussions were valuable and most of the student questions were good for summarizing the important parts of each paper. "
