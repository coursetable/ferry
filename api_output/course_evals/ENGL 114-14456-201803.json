            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the mystery surrounding human consciousness, not to mention I think that my writing improved as well. The in-class discussions and the classmate writing workshops were a great way to hear different people's perspectives on intriguing issues. The curriculum was fascinating; we discussed everything including subjective value of art, The Matrix, the possibility of artificial consciousness, and more. The class was always interesting; I truly gained a lot from this course, both in my writing skill and in my understanding of topics related to the human mind. Overall great class. ",
            "\u00a0Besides being in a fascinating class that forced me to reconsider many fundamental ideas I had on consciousness, I learned that there was more to writing than just sounding academic and doing lots of research. This class was extremely helpful in teaching me how to write more concisely, clearly, and effectively. ",
            "\u00a0This class made me think a lot. It also challenged me by getting me to really care about the things topics we researched and wrote about. This was a very thought provoking class and it taught me a lot about how to organize my thoughts and arguments on top of the tremendous amount that I learned about focus of the class-- the mind and the world. ",
            "\u00a0My writing ability was improved significantly. Specifically I felt that the organization and conectedness of my writing was impacted greatly. The process of writing a research process was especially valuable as it taught me how much research and work was necessary to develop a complex paper. I also learned a lot about consciousness and perception. ",
            "\u00a0Insights into how my mind connects with the world. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved greatly. I learned how to fully address a question or an idea. Specifically, I learned a lot about how our minds work and took a deeper look into what consciousness means to not only humans, but animals and artificial intelligence. This class truly changed how I think about my existence and other existences. ",
            "\u00a0learned how to write a sound essay from start to finish ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 114 with Professor Young was not only a course that taught me a lot about academic writing, but also a course with a very interesting and engaging topic. The course was structured around two core values for me: the teaching of well-structured and strong academic writing techniques and the engagement with the topic of our mind's relation with our world. Through the course I developed my writing skills, I learned how to utilize sources in order to compose a research paper, and how to make my voice heard within my papers. I learned the importance of clear prose and simplicity in writing and the significance of straightforward, and clear topic sentences. The course taught me how to compose strong arguments and make use of opposing views in order to further strengthen my thesis. It also helped me with pinpointing the fallacies in my writing and trying to correct them, always in a constructive way. Apart from teaching me things in the sense of writing, the course kindled my curiosity for the topics of consciousness and the perception of reality. Through the texts that were distributed and read in class, I gain a unique insight into the topics that we engaged with in the course, and I learned how to use the information retained from our discussions in class to compose my papers. All in all, I believe that this class equipped me with extremely useful skills in writing and with enthralling knowledge in the field of consciousness and the mind. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to express my ideas a lot better on paper. I learned to understand reading in order to join the conversation and pay attention to details in film. I became aware of many of the mistakes I make in my writing and will now be aware of it moving forward. "

            "\u00a0I think the class was structured very well. The 1-on-1 meetings with the instructor were very helpful in working out the kinks in our papers. The peer writing workshops were a great way to hear other's perspectives and opinions on our papers. The in class discussions were engaging and fascinating. The curriculum was also intriguing. Can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very demanding in terms of brainstorming. It is not easy to come up with ideas to write about, and even harder to do the proper research on it. This is a weakness that seems to be consistent with many writing courses. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the topic of this writing seminar is fabulous. The mind and consciousness is a fascinating topic which everybody can write about for ages. There is no shortage of material and will get everybody engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness are the heavy reliance on conversation. Conversation has to come naturally and we could dive really deep into topics, however when that natural flow isn't there the class can get dry. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that I learned how to write higher level papers and address large ideas. ",
            "\u00a0i liked it. good structure. maybe more emphasis on class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie mainly on its structure, its philosophy, and the high level of engagement and help that Professor Young brought to it. Initially, the course is structured in such a way, so as to promote student learning and development of strong writing techniques. Students entered the course with varying levels of experience in academic writing and the course catered very well for that need. It started off from the very basics and moved on to more complicated and detail-oriented comments on writing. The papers that we composed were initially short papers based on one or two sources, focused closely on those sources and then moved on to be larger more complicated research papers. There was a progression from straightforward analysis to deeper engagement with topics of interest that led to a very comprehensive understanding of how academic writing works. This specific progression of the course allowed us the students to understand the ideas of the course better and literally walked us step by step through academic writing techniques. Furthermore, the fact that ENGL 114 is offered in the spectrum of so many different topics and has as its aim to make students learn academic writing by engaging with a topic that is of great interest to them is an aspect of the course that facilitates the learning experience and makes the teaching of academic writing a lot more engaging and interesting. Another strength of the course lies on the fact that it was built upon the notion of feedback. We all received a lot of feedback on writing throughout the course both from professor Young and from our fellow students, something that helped me a lot with developing my writing. Finally, professor Young is a wonderful instructor that adds a lot to the experience of the course and promotes a high level of understanding and engagement, something that aids the learning process. If I had to pinpoint any weakness in the course, I would say that there is maybe a need for the course to start on in a more interesting way so as to immediately grasp the students' attention. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course. If you are interested in the mysteries of the human mind, consciousness, artificial intelligence, or enjoy the movie The Matrix, you will surely like this class. It gave me a better understanding of these topics and more. Not to mention, my writing improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to students who like to think think outside the box. The course combined philosophy, psychology, art, moviemaking, and of course, writing in a very engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. First off,  the course topic was fascinating and it I think it is a great class for anyone who is interested in consciousness or computation. The class also improved my writing a lot and I think it is a great class to take for people who really want to work to improve their writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was structured in a way which emphasized not only writing but learning from your writing and how to improve it. The amount of feedback that we got on our essays was wonderful and helped us to hone our craft. Content wise, the topic was very interesting and made writing much less painful because every idea was novel and exploratory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they really want to challenge and understand the lens through which you individually see the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was so interesting. We learned about consciousness through interesting articles and books and were able to watch the Matrix and then analyze the movie in an essay. The writing was enjoyable as you got to choose what exactly you wanted to write about. Professor Young was very helpful and interactive and I felt that the workload was manageable due to how she structured the timeline of the class. This was my favorite class of the semester!! ",
            "\u00a0yes. very helpful ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially somebody that does not have a lot of experience in academic writing and wishes to further develop skills in that field. The course equipped me with so much knowledge and so many skills on how to compose strong argumentative essays, and it showed me in a very comprehensive way what is needed of me in the scheme of academic writing. Any student that enters Yale has an idea of writing academic essays; nonetheless, in most cases students are not \"trained\" to write strong academic papers. ENGL 114 is a course that helps a lot in that sense. This specific section of ENGL 114 is one that is of extreme interest, especially to people that think about cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, or psychology or even for somebody that is interested in the mysteries of the mind and our perception of the world. I hold the conviction that this course not only is a strong start on academic writing at Yale, but also acts as an impetus for further engagement with the relation of mind and world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, the discussions were really interesting and everyone was always really engaged. I learned a lot about what my writing looks like now and what it should look like moving forward. "
