To me, the relationships between the techniques we learned for 2 and 3 dimensions brought up very interesting questions about generalization to higher dimensions, though we didn't discuss those questions much.

            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses is that there is just too much material. It is hard to process everything and actually understand the math behind the concepts, when there are three new concepts every class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of review material and office hours available, problem sets mostly reflected material taught and took minimal time, exams contained fair questions.\r\nWeaknesses: the grad student who taught my class (Flor) was excellent, but my friends in other classes did not like their teachers and learned nothing from class, relying on the textbook. With Flor, however, I never even opened the textbook (except to find the hw problems! ",
            "\u00a0A vast majority of the students in this course have taken it before. That was not something I was aware of. I had taken up to AP BC Calc in high school, so I figured the next step of math was the logical choice. I wish I had known most kids had taken the course, because they knew this stuff and I had never even heard of it.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I had to put in the work, but I believe I achieved at least a decent understanding of multivariable concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a great support structure, with many instructors and tutors available to help. ",

            "\u00a0This course was super fast paced which was really nice but at times a little bit overwhelming. By biggest complaint with this course was the inconsistency of teach quality across sections. I was lucky to have a great teacher but I heard from a lot of people who were not so fortunate. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very intense but allowed us to learn a lot of material in a short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved my teacher and I think overall the class was amazing! It might be good to level the classes a little more if possible. Some kids in my class had done multi variable before and others were really struggling. ",
            "\u00a0It is strong in that it teaches the right things and the instructor is very good. However, it puts a very large amount of content in a very short amount of time, and this rush could be improved. Also, in terms of grading, there are heavy penalties for careless errors that do not indicate how well or not a student has learned the material - these should be made less severe. ",
            "\u00a0The professor had a very strong relationship with the students in each class. I can't think of any specific weaknesses that come to mind. ",
            "\u00a0The course was clearly organized, and the connections between topics kept most of the material fresh. I think that the section format is very important to this course because it allowed for more individual interactions with instructors and time to work on practice problems in class. There were lots of review sessions before exams, and material was available for extra practice.\r\n\r\nAlthough I understand that this course is intended to teach core skills and be applicable to many areas, I would have appreciated some discussion of specific applications. I think it would have made the uses of each technique clearer and made the material more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the amount of help and guidance available to students in the form of tutoring and office hours that are extremely helpful. A weakness is that towards the end of the class, concepts such as Stoke's Theorem and Divergence Theorem are too complicated to prove or derive in class. If we do not understand why something works, what is the point of learning it? The class also sometimes moves too fast to let information sink in. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that it went into good detail with topics.  A weakness is the sheer breadth and pace of the course, but I do not think that can or should be changed.  The challenge is necessary. "

            "\u00a0Yes - the math department at my high school was quite rigorous and the courses fast-paced, so this course was relatively easy. The problem sets took about 2 hours a week, my teacher (Flor Orosz) was always around to help (office hours, after class, email), and there was plenty of review material to help me study for exams. Even if you don't plan on being a stem major (like me), this course is not that bad (despite its reputation). ",
            "\u00a0Beware! I took this fall of freshman year not knowing that most other kids had already taken multivariable calc before. I had not. The course is very fast paced, do not miss a class. I attended office hours at least once almost every week. It was definitely my hardest class this past semester, but also the one I enjoyed the most. Having not taken the material before while almost every other kid had, I definitely had to put in more work than most people. If you haven't taken mutli before, then take math115 in the fall and 120 in the spring (also the curve will be nicer because you wont be with all the ridiculously smart people who have taken a minimum of a year of this). That being said, I had a great teacher (Flor!) who was da best, which helped a ton. I did enjoy the course, I just wish I had fully known what I was getting into. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, especially if the student has an interest in mathematics. The valuable skills learned, interesting material, and amount of resources made this course great. ",
            "\u00a0Only if necessary for major or math background ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. The pset grading could have been a little better (more feedback), but overall it was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0If a student is interested in math, for sure take this class. It's basically essential in terms of content. Do be prepared though to spend time on your own really understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- if they like math, they should definitely take it. It really tested my mental abilities which I really liked. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, especially if it is a required course because it does what is advertised - teaches multivariable calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you need to take it ",
            "\u00a0I and almost all of my classmates took this course because it was required for our majors, but I would recommend it even for students who don't need to take it. It introduces interesting and useful concepts while strengthening basic skills, and there's plenty of support available for students who want to use it. For anyone who takes this class out of personal interest, I would recommend also taking a class that emphasizes applications of calculus to appreciate how this material is useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend taking this class. It is very challenging, but it will make you a better student in the end, and will allow you to gauge how you study best. Sometimes you fail, buy your professor and peers will help you if you put in the effort, allowing you to improve. This is a very valuable skill to learn first semester of freshman year. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is a good challenge, as well as a fundamental course for other areas of study. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard and grading is pretty brutal for small mistakes that don't demonstrate a lack of understanding.  If you're okay with that, great class otherwise. "
