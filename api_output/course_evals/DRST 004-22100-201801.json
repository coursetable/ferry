            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding for the western philosophic tradition, and how to write about and engage with the tradition. ",
            "\u00a0DS guides you through a large body of important texts with an organized structure. In the course, you learn a large amount in a remarkable period of time and gives you a great foundation for in-depth study in the humanities later in your college career. A fantastic overview of the major highlights of western thought. ",
            "\u00a0how to parse a philosophical task and strategies for dealing with that\r\nhow to construct a philosophical argument\r\nwhat questions were useful for discussion and what were not ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to evaluate different thinkers and see how they view the world. ",
            "\u00a0-ability to critically read philosophy\r\n-ability to gain an understanding of ridiculously complexly-written works (@Hegel @Kant)\r\n-understanding of philosophy from Descartes onward ",
            "\u00a0how to write a philosophy paper, how to reconstruct and critique an argument, how to read and understand a difficult philosophy text ",
            "\u00a0I didnt learn anything; I was trying to learn about modern philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Werner is an incredible teacher that really cares about his students. If you, as a student, take time to meet with him outside of class and go through his meticulous (and quickly returned) papers, the rewards are limitless. That being said, he is an incredibly tough grader with nonbiased but strong opinions. ",
            "\u00a0This beautiful class helped my critical thinking, reading comprehension and clarity of analysis. But beyond abstract skills, it exposed me to essential human questions like the reliability of our senses, the mental perception of time, the logical instability of slavery and options about morality. "

            "\u00a0This course was outstanding. I entered it as someone who struggled with philosophy, and was extremely challenged this semester, yet through the help of Prof. Werner I was able to gain a love of philosophy. I cannot think of how to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great as a \"crash course\" of the western canon. However, due to the huge range of material covered, there isn't enough time to go into the works in depth. It's great for exposing you to different ideas; if there's an author you find very interesting, then you should look into their work in more depth afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, the three tracks of DS don't intertwine as much as it may sound (or at least as I expected). They are essentially three separate courses. While they may reference each other occasionally, and sometimes an author that overlaps, there isn't too much interdisciplinary analysis (i.e. , looking into the historical context of a philosophical or literary movement). Sometimes, the timeframes of the works across the tracks fall out of sync. However, this would probably a lot more work, and the tracks will likely give you enough to make these kinds of analysis on your own if you choose. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and summaries were very helpful for class discussion, as well as the feedback on papers before and after turning them in.\r\nWe did sometimes get bogged down in a minute piece of text and not reach other big ones, which was sometimes frustrating, but overall worked out in the end because it would be covered in lecture ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great variety of thinkers \r\nweakness: maybe not Hegel for next year ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course is awesome. Some of the works couldve been done without, but on the whole it was a great sample of modern philosophy. One potential issue is the heavy variance in the class based on the quality of the instructor, but most of the philosophy are quite solid. Lectures are helpful, and it was fun! ",
            "\u00a0some of the materials are difficult to understand even with the professor explaining them. in general the classes are too short to fully discuss the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness was definitely my professor. He was bad at explaing the material. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions could be streamlined. ",
            "\u00a0I quite enjoyed the course. The Professor made an effort to adapt the learning environment to student needs and desires. At times, the tension between exploring the text as a group with out own initiative vs. being guided through it by the instructor was difficult to navigate, and it is a question going forward. Discussions were always productive and so was guidance, so the best balance is difficult to determine. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. While it is certainly a challenge, it is a worthwhile one. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It does an incredible job teaching you a lot over a short period of time. It gives you a huge library of knowledge for analyzing present day works, and enables you to recognize allusions, traditions, and references you could only know by reading and connecting all the texts that are conveniently and cleanly presented to you on the syllabus. Just be prepared to devote a lot of time and energy to the course: it is a lot of reading and writing compared to other Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was honestly one of the most engaging classes I took last summer and I continually looked forward to discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Learning to write philosophy papers was one of the crucial takeaways of the year for me. I've discovered I like the moral side of philosophy, and got to evaluate much of that this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. DS is a wonderful program. Philosophy 2nd semester wasnt as exciting as 1st semester or H/P because Idealists get a bit repetitive, but it was overall a very interesting course and a great way to get a sample of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you're interested in early modern philosophy. no, if you don't want to spend hours writing papers and poring over difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I was continuously receiving bad grades in this course, and I could not quite understand what it was my professor disliked about my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in philosophy and eager to learn and improve. Not necessarily make a friend through Werner. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. DS philosophy furnishes the mind and exposes one to a variety of schools that one may choose to investigate further later on. It provides structure for tackling pressing issues that will always be relevant, and improves reading comprehension and confidence! "
