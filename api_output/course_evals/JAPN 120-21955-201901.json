            "\u00a0I developed a higher level of comfort with speaking, reading, writing, and understanding Japanese. We learned a lot of grammar structures that are actually useful, and we learned lots of common phrases and conversational situations that frequently come up in Japan. Some elements of Japanese culture make a lot more sense after having learned about the ways the language functions. ",

            "\u00a0constant work makes for constant improvement! very well taught, and the practice conversations are fun so the class has a good time. \r\nIt might help to have more speaking practice for homework/outside of class rather than worksheets, which are only sometimes helpful. ",
            "\u00a0just because of the format of the course, it was sometimes weaker at writing & conversational speaking; language table was a good supplement for that! "
