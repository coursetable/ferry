            "\u00a0The course's readings and movies were interesting and gave insight into the different latinx cultures.\r\n\r\nHowever, the workload was insane, even for a 1.5 credit course. The homework on top of studying for the tests and quizzes and preparing presentations made doing quality work impossible. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the class was less focused on extremely specific, seemingly random, probably unimportant grammatical rules. Unfortunately, I yet again come away from a Yale Spanish class feeling like my speaking hasn't improved that much. But, I've got all 5 types of \"clusulas con si\" DOWN so I guess that counts for something. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely a lot of work but I learned a lot. However, the work load is very heavy during the second half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Grammar is reinforced throughout the course, making one more cognisant of errors they have been making during lower level courses. The new gramatical structures also helped us include more diversity in our writing and speaking.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Took a lot of time and encouraged memorization ",
            "\u00a0The course's presentations and projects require a significant amount of work for the amount of credit attributed to each, and they don't have significant benefit. The online homework system is very finicky, and the online textbook appears to be disabled. Grading is unnecessarily rough. That said, the need to speak exclusively in Spanish did improve my speaking abilities considerably. ",
            "\u00a0There was a ton of work for the course, and it was not always enjoyable. I did not like Las Batallas en el Desierto very much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: practice Spanish\r\nWeaknesses: no standardization of grading between sections, books and stories had vocab that was beyond comprehension level ",
