            "\u00a0I learned how to better apply my music skills, the basics of periods and sentences, sonata exposition form. Most importantly learned \"the rules\" and that sometimes it's actually okay to break \"the rules\". ",

            "\u00a0Unfortunately some of the theory and weekly homework was quite tedious. I think also that the grade value of different portions of the course was a little strange to me. I thought that more value should be placed on the exams and projects, especially the projects. All this being said, I LOVED doing the composition projects. I thought they were incredibly fun and highly instructive. I understood the theory much more through the projects than through other parts of the course. I think that in addition to the two large projects, there could also be a couple more smaller composition projects. "

            "\u00a0Yes; it is interesting and challenging and helps fulfill music major requirements ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would advise prospective class-takers to be prepared for the tedium of the theory, but also I think that my enjoyment of the projects was worth it. Also, I did mostly get from it what I wanted, which was a greater understanding of music theory. "
