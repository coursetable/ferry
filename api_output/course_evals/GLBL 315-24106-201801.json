            "\u00a0You'll understand the EU. Like you'll get it -- there's not much else to say. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a comprehensive look at both the economics and politics of European integration and issues relevant to the European Union in recent years. Not only did the course build foundational knowledge in terms of the history of the EU, fundamental trade theory, and other core macroeconomic concepts, but it also provided a real-world grounding to all of these concepts. The course was also different in the type of assignments given, which were designed to push us to think critically, take a stance using the concepts we had learned, and defend it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the EU in detail through an economic lens. The EU now makes more sense to me given the economic motives that led to its creation. ",
            "\u00a0This course demanded that I pay much more attention to policy and news. It taught me a lot about European political dynamics, and the potential futures for the continent. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course. As an American with very little clue about how the European Union worked, I found the course quite helpful in teaching me about the intricacies of the single market, the customs union, monetary union, Brexit, and more. Some days we did a good amount of Econ (youll be fine as long as you sort of remember intro micro/macro), but other days we spent learning about specific issues in Europe, like institutions toward the beginning or events like Brexit and the sovereign debt crisis toward the end. I feel like a much less ignorant person having taken this class! ",
            "\u00a0So many skills: reading graphs properly, debating, writing memos, insights into European institutions and history. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of EU institutions, economics, trade theory, political realities. Gained good writing tips and feedback useful in everything from policy papers to corporate memos! ",
            "\u00a0How the EU works, why the EU does what it does, what the EU is doing currently and the ramifications of these policies, economic rationale of the EU. \r\n-----\r\ntl;dr everything about the EU "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the course. There's low workload and it's mostly useful (Psets not so much but there were 3 and they took little time). The position papers are fun, easy, and a good part of the course. Final exam is fun and easy. Best part is Professor Amand. Gives good feedback too. ",
            "\u00a0The class flowed through a logical progression and each class built upon the concepts learned in the previous class. Additionally, as mentioned briefly before, the assignments (i.e. problem sets and position papers) and the in-class debates really helped me solidify my knowledge and put what I had learned to use. This class really works well as a seminar, as I learned a lot not just from the course material, but also the comments of my classmates and professor. As for a weakness, I would have preferred perhaps a little more regularity in assignments, but the work was definitely manageable and enjoyable to do. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to learn about the EU in depth while also learning about the economics of trade. The course could have facilitated more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The workload wasn't terribly evenly spread. The professor was very good. The slides from class were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course achieves two great balances: the first is an extremely smart and knowledgeable professor (more knowledgeable about the material than most professors Ive had at Yale, which says a lot) who can also teach complicated issues in a clear and understandable way. Consistent, intuitive examples were a big part of this for me. The second is that you learn a great deal without needing to do a huge amount of work. If you show up to class each time and just listen to the professor, you will learn a lot. The written feedback on the position papers, as well as the individual sessions to go through them, were quite helpful. The Econ graphs were occasionally a bit hard to follow (especially the different sections with the A,B,C,D,E,F,G,), and I wish there was some way for us to supplement our understanding of that material, maybe with more slides posted on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0It's a wonderful class. One weakness: having a single partner through the entire semester is difficult. If taught again people should be allowed to partner up with different people on psets and position papers. ",
            "\u00a0A bit too disorganized (few readings in the middle, haphazard PSETs) and tangential. The Professor says extremely interesting stuff, yet it's not always fully relevant to the material (I liked it, however). ",
            "\u00a0The course is a lecture seminar, so its not as difficult as a pure seminar but at the same time you can ask questions and clarification (plus there is no section). Professor Amand teaches very well and you learn a lot. Also, Professor Amand knows what he is talking about, and has clear evidence for any kind of doubt you have on any subject. Since this was the first time the class was taught, its understandable that sometimes, the class seems unstructured, but it was unfortunate that the second half of the semester, the slides were gone. I feel that the slides helped maintain structure to the teaching. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting course on a relevant subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes you have to take it. I wish Professor Amand taught all of my classes. His humor is perfect and the way he explains things -- even complex macro -- is just wonderful. He's also an expert and knows about everything in every way. You'll mostly understand the EU after this course, have a great time with Professor Amand, and do little work. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about the European Union, international economics, and just basic European politics. As someone who went in with a keen interest in the European Union but knew not too much about trade theory or international economics, this course helped fill in the gaps in my knowledge and really pushed my understanding (and helped me realize I had so much more to learn!). I felt that all the assignments given had a purpose and really helped solidify my understanding. Overall, a really fulfilling course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student even if they dont have a strong economics background, because we go through the material in a very coherent way. It would make most sense to take this course if you were very interested in the EU and international economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learned a lot about the history of the E.U and the economic reasoning behind a lot of policies and decisions. The seminar is engaging and interesting, a good mix of history and economics. The grading is fair, feedback is clear and given even on p sets, and the in class debated are fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any Yale student interested in the history of the European Union, the sovereign debt crisis, Brexit, or transnational political dynamics. If you're interested in transnational politics, definitely consider taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, even if youre not majoring in Global Affairs or anything related to it. If youre like the vast majority of people in this school, you have no idea how Europe really works, and this course will tell you, in an interesting and engaging way. It is not purely about economics: the EU was structured with economics in mind, but there is plenty else to understand about it, and we went over that as well. Professor Amand is a great teacher, and I would take another class with him again. This class is a great way to learn extremely relevant material from someone who knows his stuff without it killing you with work, and Id highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Marnix is a great instructor. But make sure that you have adequate econ background: you need more than intro micro macro for this. Probably intermediate micro and even perhaps intermediate macro. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an amazing seminar. It was always a pleasure going to class, I learned a lot and Prof. Amand was simply superb! ",
            "\u00a0YES! YES YES YES! Lowest workload, and you learn a lot! This is what every student wants. On bad weeks, maybe 30 mins to an hour of work per week. Most weeks, 0 assigned work. "
