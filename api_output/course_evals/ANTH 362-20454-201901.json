            "\u00a0I learned about analytical skills to better analyze processes and phenomena in Chinese history. I gained specific knowledge regarding Chinese history and Chinese anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I've literally learned so much and been able to deconstruct everything I've learned about this class. So good especially if you are a social science major wanting to study China but has little anthropolgical background. You get a taste of major anthropology of China over the past century and how that has changed but also how to evaluate those arguments critically. We cover a wide range of topics so there's definitely some topic you are interested in or would want to do research on down the line. Come into this class with an open mind and ready to learn about how China is agrarian based through and through yet dynamically changing in the past fifty years. You will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theoretical frameworks that set the foundations for Chinese anthropology and the various cultural institutions that they applied to, such as marriage, religion, etc. Professor Siu is brilliant and amazing at tying together the loose facts into a coherent flow of information in a way that was engaging and challenged us to think about what constitutes Chinese culture and identity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a critical thinker and reader, and to truly consider outside perspectives, and to analyze content through various lenses. \r\nI learned to be more confident in myself and how to actively engage with the material, especially in terms of asking questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized thematically, with each of the readings focusing on a certain topic within South China (or greater China) Studies. Youll learn a lot about China if you do the readings! The final paper was a research proposal, so if youve never written one before, that could be a useful skill to learn. "

            "\u00a0Class time was often in the form of a lecture, and didn't have much class discussion involved. Professor Siu has amazing insight into all things Chinese anthropology and Chinese history so listening to her lectures was often quite interesting. Reading were many and long, but the absence of reading responses or class-wide discussion made it so that interaction with the readings didn't need to be unnecessarily deep. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Siu is an amazing teacher, so kind and warm and sharp, cares deeply about her students and students' wellness on top of their intellectual well being. The topics are really interesting and the readings well selected. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wished Prof Siu gave us more structured discussion time in the class to talk about how we understood the readings and listen to our classmates' ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the reading materials and Professor Siu's teaching style. The only weakness is that there was often a lot more material than we could cover in our class time, but Professor Siu made extra efforts to meet one-on-one with students if needed and tried to explain as much of the material as possible during class time. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is incredibly knowledgable, she is truly amazing and always blew me away when she explained the readings we had. I also really enjoyed how she was able to connect content from one reading or week/category, with another, in a way where everything essentially tied in and it made sense. \r\nI think the course can be improved by maybe having one student each week help lead seminar discussion by coming to class with either a summary of the readings, or a list of questions that they came up with in order to encourage discussion. I think it will help students step out of their comfort zone, and promote more class discussion among all the students. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Siu is incredibly knowledgeable and will share all that she knows shes just a wealth of resources and wisdom! Office hours are always really enjoyable.\r\n\r\nHowever, if youre looking for a seminar in which you can talk a lot and discuss with other students, you wont find that here. The amount of people in the class definitely made it perfect for a roundtable-style seminar, but thats not the route the course took. I spoke maybe two or three times in the entire semester; almost all the time in lecture is spent with Professor Siu talking, which is quite a long time for 110 minutes a week. It is a little difficult to stay engaged when you know you wont have to speak up or answer any questions in class, and the only two assignments are pretty flexible papers. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in contemporary or historical Chinese studies. If you have interest in the topic, you will definitely enjoy the readings and lectures. However, if you don't already have interest in these topics, you may have trouble with motivating yourself to do all the meetings, engaging with material in lecture, or making yourself meet with Professor Siu. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely would. If you are interested in China already, this is a must take. There is a learning curve if you know 0 about China but Helen Siu will definitely help you catch up and cut you some slack. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is remotely interested in Chinese culture! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Professor Siu is incredibly sweet, and creates a positive and stress-free class environment. She remembers everyones names right away, and she always has interesting material and stories to bring to class, alongside helping us dissect the readings. She is very easy to approach and talk to during office hours and overall is very supportive! ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in China or anthropology, yes! I wouldnt recommend to someone who doesnt already have an interest in these fields, however. "
