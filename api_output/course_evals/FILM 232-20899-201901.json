Camille's lectures are impeccably crafted and give you such amazing insight not only into the movies we watch but into other defining films of the time period and the history/culture surrounding Classical Hollywood. I feel like I come away learning so much about the politics and life of the time period we studied, in addition to the film knowledge I acquired. Every lecture feels like artistry. Every assignment is so meticulously detailed and planned to make them the greatest learning experiences possible, while still remaining so enjoyable. Sections were genuinely fun, and the weekly screenings were a highlight of my semester. This class is so, so carefully thought out and it truly shows. The freedom we had to choose what we cared about and follow it wholeheartedly was incredible. Camille obviously loves this subject and makes it so that you cannot help loving it, too. You couldn't ask for a better class. ",
            "\u00a0Camille taught me to appreciate art always. This class allowed me to challenge myself to focus on developing my skills in evaluating film, and introduced me to a slew of great movies I never would have watched without it.

It was so fun and enlightening to examine films not only as historical artifacts but as pieces of art and taste.  I knew this class was going to be a must-take before I even shopped it, and it turned out to be true every step of the way.  I think it might've actually interested me in working in the film industry somewhere down the road. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible! Throughout this course, we studied several films throughout the classical Hollywood era, viewing each film individually as a piece of art. We watched The Big Parade, City Lights, It Happened One Night, Top Hat, Stagecoach, Shadow of a Doubt, The Best Years of Our Lives, Roman Holiday, Sunset Blvd., All About Eve, The Night of the Hunter, North by Northwest, and Psycho. I learned how to approach watching films. I learned how to watch films more carefully and how to appreciate them fully. We studied the history, the studios, the techniques, and the people involved.

Insights on the industry's underbelly, showing that current discrimination issues have its roots in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I began this class only recognizing the names of three of the class's films and knowing nothing about any of them (so basically zero knowledge about film). I learned so much about film and American history, Hollywood, actors, directors, films, studios, etc. I gained an intense appreciation for elements of film which I honestly ignored before this class. I learned to love black and white films, silent films, cinematography, and scoring, among other things. Even if you have seen one or two of these films, Professor Thomasson's lectures are fascinating and engaging and will make you appreciate the films so much more.\r\n\r\nI also feel this class made me a much better writer. The TAs and Professor Thomasson give so much feedback on the papers (Camille read thousands of pages because she read every final) and give advice that applies to all disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first class at Yale that made me feel like I belonged.  Like I was a part of the community.  Camille and Ariel (my TF), both pushed me to be a better writer while respecting my creativity and individuality.  I enjoyed attending this class every week.  TAKE THIS CLASS! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Hollywood and how films are produced. ",
            "\u00a0Having no significant background in film studies outsiding of liking movies, I learned so much about close analysis of film, whether it relates to visuals, narrative, or historical context. Meanwhile, I learned some of the basics about how to articulate these ideas through our papers and journal entries. Overall, I feel like I gained a great knowledge of Classical Hollywooda vast subject that I knew almost nothing aboutin a very short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a beautiful introduction to classical Hollywood film and the players involved. You watch 13 incredible films spanning almost 40 years and several genres. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Weekly movie screenings were always very exciting; the films chosen to be screened were all very engaging. In addition, the biweekly lectures were also extremely engaging, and I was fascinated with the many interesting facts that I learned about classical Hollywood films and the behind-the-scenes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be nice if we had more guidance on our midterm and final papers. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Professor Thomasson! She was a wonderful professor  one of my favorites. She made this very large lecture course feel like an intimate coffee chat with her every lecture. She was very accessible outside of class and clearly cared a lot for us. ",
            "\u00a0Everything in this class was relevant. The films screened were great choices and Professor Thomasson's lectures were very insightful and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how engaging Professor Thomasson was with class activities--e.g. when we all participated in 'creating' a score for a silent film, the Jeopardy games, or the Treasure Chest challenges. The activities we did during section were particularly engaging, and didn't focus on any pedantic readings or boring abstractions. It was great to get together and talk about these wonderful, classic American films on a regular basis. The screenings were time-intensive and demanding, but a highly rewarding experience every week. I don't have any real complaints about the course. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED the lectures by Professor Thomasson! They were really beautiful, engaging, and moving, and every lecture is like a walk through Hollywood film history. ",
            "\u00a0The movies are fantastic, Camille's narrative about Hollywood is fantastic, the papers are pleasantly open-ended. I loved everything. ",
            "\u00a0Truly incredible lectures ",
            "\u00a0This is a chill, awesome course! The films are very thought-provoking and really enjoyable, and by having no exams, the class really reduces stress and allows one to intrinsically enjoy the material. If anything, the class could focus more on painting a more complete picture of the classical Hollywood narrative, focusing on the unifying themes and historical significance of the Hollywood industry from silent films to Alfred Hitchcock. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Everything! The amazing, thoughtful lectures, the liberty afforded to you in the assignments, the availability of personal feedback, the communities created in section, and the wonderful selection of films. It was such a great learning experience because it truly felt like personal enrichment. I was extremely lucky that I got placed in Camille's own section and got to spend even more time with her, but everyone loves Camille. There was a literal line around the auditorium on the last day of class of students who wanted to hug her before leaving for the summer. This class was undoubtedly the thing I looked forward to most on a weekly basis. Weekly film diaries, a short interview, a midterm paper & final paper make this class a very manageable course load, but please do not treat it as a gut. Camille deserves better than that. I am so sad it is over! Weaknesses: Literally nothing. ",
            "\u00a0Everything is awesome! AMAZING class! THE BEST class that I've taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that there're no exams or quizzes, so there's not much motivation to review materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 2 papers. Through these I was really able to apply the critical methods I had learned to films that I was interested. I had never done a true, in depth film analysis before this class, so getting to write a number of papers on this was really cool and refreshing. \r\nDownside: time intensive. 2 lectures + mandatory section + mandatory film screening is a lot. They required you to come to the film screeninga and forbade you to watch the films on your own time which was not great for me (and I bit unreasonable I feel) because that meant I more or less missed an entire semester of meetings for a club of which I'm on the board. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing that frustrated me was the mandatory Tuesday 7:00 P.M. movie viewing. I know this was implemented to drive more active engagement, but there were several times throughout the semester when the immense academic pressure I was under (midterms, interviews, etc.) was made worse because I had to take 2-3 hours out of my night to watch a movie (being able to watch at home over the weekend/when I could choose would have eliminated this stress).\r\n\r\nOther than that, this class went beyond all expectations I had for it. Absolutely fantastic!! ",
            "\u00a0CAMILLE MAKES THIS COURSE! She is the absolute best. The most caring, passionate, fascinating professor you will ever find at Yale. Her lectures are so good you will not want them to end! She talks about the material with such eloquence. She asks important question and always involves us as an audience. I loved the format of this course and I cant think of any weaknesses... I appreciated that we were prompted to work on our assignments early before the due date (by submitting drafts etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures and films we covered in this course. Since I had never taken a film studies course before, I think it would have been interesting to read some film theory. ",
            "\u00a0More information about what is expected in essays. Not enough info about expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomasson is the highest caliber of teacher. She makes this class feel like a seminar, has so much passion for her students and the class material, and works tirelessly to deliver a perfect lecture each week. She finds so many ways for students to engage with the material - from weekly trivia to participation in lecture to extra movie screenings. Her assignments never feel trivial, redundant, or superfluous, choosing instead for students to reflect by way of writing instead of excessive reading. Of course, the subject material is fun and interesting - movies usually are! Nevertheless, Professor Thomasson found an incredible way to bring 21st century students into 20th century work, even silent movies that could not be farther from the CGI movie world of today. The clips she chose to punctuate lecture always felt specific and perfectly tailored, wonderful examples of exactly what she was teaching. I only wish her lectures were longer!\r\n\r\nI will say that, while I found Max a wonderful TF, my section in particular was assigned 40 lines per film journal which felt long. The film journals felt therefore like a chore instead of a fun way to engage with thoughts about the film, and I know alongside other classmates I was left counting lines and writing for quantity rather than quality. Perhaps there could be a general length suggestion but not specific mandate of line length! ",
            "\u00a0This course is superficial at best. Very little film analysis or theory. Should be much more interesting than it is. ",
            "\u00a0Really, really interesting material EVERY SINGLE LECTURE. I'm not kidding. I literally loved going to every class and listening to Camille speak of her carefully crafted lectures. Also loved how she didn't quiz/test us on the material because she simply wanted us to listen and learn, not focus on grades. It worked. There are no weaknesses in this class. ",
            "\u00a0There are very few weaknesses to this course. The lectures were the most engaging I have ever encountered at Yale (thanks to Professor Thomasson), the films we watched were incredible pieces of art that I thoroughly enjoyed, and the section provided a nice forum for discussion. I love this class as it is, and I don't think it should be changed much at all. The only thing I can think of that would improve this course is more help with writing. It is, after all, a WR credit but students are left much on their own when writing their midterm and final papers. Office hours with Camille were helpful, but my TF didn't do much to help me write my paper, and I didn't even receive one word of feedback on my final paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. The only improvement I can think of is maybe more options for screening times. ",
            "\u00a0The course is perfect as is. There is enough room for practice and improvement in writing skills, while also no being overbearing or stressful. Learning is incentivized using friendly group-competition in jeopardy games rather than testing.  This ensures genuine retention of the material as it feels much more of a conscious choice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the material, the teaching (both by the inimitable Prof. Thomasson and the lovely TAs), and the assignments.  Really everything was a strength.\r\n\r\nIf anything was a weakness, it was that the film screenings were always during Mellon forums for me, which made it tough to go to them (I would leave them early to make the screening).  Perhaps two screening dates/times in sufficiently varied time slots would be possible for future iterations and would remedy the issue. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an absolute delight! The films were incredible. The professor was incredible. Everything about this class was incredible. Working for this class didn't feel like work!\r\n\r\nOne note for improvement might be to have some more opportunities for feedback, maybe an optional writing assignment so that students could get some more feedback on their writing skills. That way, there would be more opportunities for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomasson is an excellent lecturer, and as informative as her classes were, they felt so much more like storytelling  which I suppose is fitting. The only major area for improvement that I can think of would be in scheduling; it would be nice to have a little more flexibility in when to attend the screenings, though I am not sure how feasible this is logistically or how it would be fixed. The assignments are compelling. I could not be happier for having taken the course. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class. It was amazing. I loved the material and I loved Camille. Couldn't have gone better. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the movie screenings. Having the opportunity to watch them in a theater setting was great. ",
            "\u00a0More guidance on papers (i.e. turn in drafts formally)\r\n\r\nWonderful course overall ",
            "\u00a0It was always a delight to see Professor Thomasson lecture with great passion and knowledge. I was a fan of most of the movies, but wish more sections were devoted to movie discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing! It's so interactive, engaging, and wide-ranging. I left it with a really good foundation in some classic films and film techniques. Having extra film screenings even more frequently might be great. I just wish we could've covered even more films, but I know that spending a week on each was one of the reasons I got so much from the course in the first place. Otherwise, everything was truly awesome! ",
            "\u00a0This course was beautifully organized. Prof. Thomasson curates her lectures so well that every single word feels planned and flows smoothly. The most interesting course I took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Thomasson is an amazing lecturer. I loved the weekly film screenings. ",
            "\u00a0This may be my favorite course to have ever taken at Yale. Camille is an incredible lecturer whose office hours are opportunities to learn about film, the course, and the arts. No weaknesses... ",
            "\u00a0strengths - so interesting and engaging. this class was the most incredible class I've taken.\r\nweaknesses- the only weakness is I think your grade relies too much on the TF's grading...I wish it was more the prof. ",
            "\u00a0The course is absolutely wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are Professor Thomasson and her engaging teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. I always looked forward to class. Best PowerPoint presenter, hands down. Professor translates her passion and pain like no other lecturer. Each word counts. Papers are very meaningful and adds to the learning experience. Mandatory weekly screenings are a delight, but not everyone shows up! Lots of students in my section, so student engagement could be improved with smaller sections. ",
            "\u00a0The topic and films are interesting and I think the films at least could be enjoyed no matter what; however, Camille is a saint with an indescribable aura of love that elevates this class to a higher plane of existence. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class included the very fun and engaging lectures, the amazing film choices, and the overall atmosphere of discussion and passion for Classical Hollywood. Additionally, I loved the variety and freedom afforded in all the assignments which really allowed us to explore our interests. The main weakness of this course was the sometimes confusing or unclear writing advice, which lead to some stress regarding the paper assessments/grades. This could be improved by having more professor supervision of TF curricula and writing feedback, which would unify expectations across sections and provide a more experienced perspective on teaching writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is such a fun course. Awesome movies, incredible professor, tons of interesting insights into the film industry that are interesting no matter your major. The only thing that may be helpful is more writing workshops up front and some more example film writing to get a sense for what exists in the discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I can think of anything negative to say about this class. Every lecture was a treat to go to, they were all so interesting. The films were all amazing, and enjoyable to watch. The time commitment to the class is a little bit on the higher side with two lectures, a section and a screening but it's all worth it in the end. I have a strong appreciation for classic American cinema and it is interesting to see how culture shaped Hollywood and how Hollywood shaped culture. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is Camille; she is incredibly engaging in lecture and approachable, but tough when she wants to be! "

Every single class was immersive and enlightening, which has been such a rare treat in my Yale career. ",

I looked forward to each class because the lectures were always so engaging and interesting, and I'm saying that as someone who had never watched a black-and-white film before. Even though it's a large lecture, Professor Thomasson still took the time to comment on everyone's assignments, and that's in addition to great feedback I already received from my awesome TA. I I can't say enough good things about this course! ",

I was a bit nervous about this class at first as an underclassman with essentially no film experience, but I can't overstate how welcoming, helpful, and encouraging everyone was about making me enjoy it as much as possible. Camille would invite any of her students over to her apartment for tea, cake, and one-on-one conferences to talk about their midterm, final and engagement with this course in order to make sure that everyone's experiences are as best as they possibly can be. I recommended this course to so many of my friends this semester. I wholeheartedly think you should do whatever you can to get into any class that Camille teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Please take this course or at least take a course with Camille. Your grade will largely depend on your TA, but Camille is the most warm and kind professor you will ever have, and her lectures are killer. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nEngaging lectures, fun topics every time, paper topics of your own choice. What else can you ask for? ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Incredibly  interesting and Prof Thomasson is very knowledgeable ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you want to learn about old cinema. Its not stressful, you leave it feeling competent in something you might not otherwise have known anything about, and its just an overall fantastic course. Take it if you can get in!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes! Professor Thomasson is an angel and the course material is so fascinating ! ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!!!!!!! Take it! My favorite class at Yale. This is the most wonderful, low stress, fascinating class you will ever find at Yale ... this is an absolute treasure, take it before you graduate! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend! I learned so much and it was one of the most enjoyable classes I've gotten the chance to take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! One of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This class should have been much better than it was. Would not really recommend if you want to learn anything substantive about film (take intro film or another survey course instead). If you just want to watch a few movies and learn very little about them, then I guess this class is okay. There was also so much petty bureaucracy in this class that made it actively unpleasant to be a part of. Professor Thomasson does some weird power tripping that I did not respect at all (hostile to working with students' concerns about the class) and she's also pretty fake woke in a way that is somewhat frustrating. Also, major portions of the lecture involved showing film clips and then not analyzing them or even really talking about them at all. The lectures were very surface-level and not substantive. One class we watched clips of The African Queen for fifteen minutes, which is a film that is not really relevant to the course, and then we didn't even talk about the clips? There was just so little actual film analysis at any point throughout the class. What I'm saying is if you actually want to learn anything about film, take a different class. ",
            "\u00a0YES. This was one of my favorite classes this semester, and possibly for the rest of my Yale career. Such a good writing credit course too, especially for those who may not writing-geared. Always received clear feedback on how to improve my writing. This course just has good content too, so please take it at least to experience the magic of Old Hollywood and Camille. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for all the reasons stated above- I truly enjoyed this course, and I'm not even a film major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes!!! If you commit to watching every film, you will get so much out of it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course a million times over. The course is interesting and the film selection is great. Most notably, the nature in which the course is run creates a strong sense of community. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I took at Yale. Camille is a wonderful professor, and every lecture was an absolute pleasure. The films are interesting - some are classics that I had seen, others I hadn't heard of, but I enjoyed all of them. Definitely take this class if you have the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course all day every day to anyone who asks me about it, unless they really hate film.  The films you watch are all essential, Prof. Thomasson reads them so beautifully with each lecture being enlightening and even emotionally moving, and the assignments are perfectly structured to engage with the material.  The class structure is varied, with Prof. Thomasson always excited to try new experiments or reenactments or other activities with us to keep us engaged.  I will miss this course, and I am so glad I got to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. Professor Thomasson is a wonderful professor and she is a great person to know. Over all the courses that I took, I believed that Professor Thomasson is one of the few professors who cares a lot about her students. If given opportunity, I would want to take another class with her. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I would recommend any course taught by Professor Thomasson! She is an absolute sweetheart. She is the most incredible teacher, and I think everyone should take a class taught by her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Camille is an angel and absolutely incredible as a professor!! This course completely changed my perspective of classical hollywood films and made me appreciate them so more!! ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class I have taken at Yale with the best professor I have had. Whatever your major, whatever your style, as long as you have the slightest interest in film, I highly recommend taking this class. It is an ideal experience. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. ",
            "\u00a0YES! TAKE THIS COURSE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT. IT IS AMAZING. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course as it is very enjoyable and the professor is great! The movies are captivating and really show the best and worst of Hollywood during this time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Camille is wonderful and youll watch amazing movies ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended, especially if you are interested in movies or photography, or even just watching stuff. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to take a good class, take this one! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course!!!! Professor Thomasson is an absolute gem. You will learn so much from her lectures, and section meetings are great, too. This is a rare class that is both genuinely fun and academically rigorous. You'll be working hard and spending a fair bit of time on the coursetwo 50-min lectures, one 50-min section, one movie screening (anywhere from 1.5-2.5+ hours) a weekbut you'll get to actually have fun. This class will give you a super helpful background in lots of important films, and it's amazing whether you want to be a film major or not. I'm so glad I took this class. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Thomasson is incredibly dedicated to her students, and this alone makes the class worth taking. Even if you aren't interested in film, you are bound to enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to any prospective student. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It has been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and the professor is truly amazing. If you put in the effort you will get a good grade, and will end up enjoying the class a lot more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely wonderful class that isnt a lot of work. Great way to fulfill a writing credit with minimal work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I cherished this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It has been my favorite course at Yale. Thomasson is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Camille is a joy. You will get more out of it the more you put in. One of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. There are a lot of time commitments but because the course is so interesting, it doesnt feel like actual work. I would highly recommend this course and it is by far the best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course as it is a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Just look at the unanimous praise. Unprecedented at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The best course of my Yale career. I went from film troglodyte to cinephile. Camille is so ridiculously caring, kind, and friendly that I left every class happier than I came in (except for the ones where we were talking about the sadder side of Hollywood, Camille can hit all the notes). \r\n\r\nI cannot emphasize enough how much you should take this class. I know no one that did not enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was amazing. Regardless of if you need a WR credit, you have to take this class. Camille is an incredible Professor and person. The class also gives you the chance to watch a movie each week which is a nice break from other work. Sections are fun and engaging as you get to dive into the films and have interesting discussions with your peers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to almost any other student at Yale. If you have even a passing interest in film, writing, or American history, this class is a must-take. It is without a doubt the most purely enjoyable and interesting class Ive taken at Yale. Even if you dont take the class, show up to a lecture or film viewing; itll be worth the effort! ",
            "\u00a0Just take it. If you like old movies, or even if you think some tiny part of you may, take this course. Professor Thomasson is incredible, the films are great, lectures are engaging. You are graded based on two papers, a film diary, and participation. It's a fair amount of work but not too much and you can take your writing any direction you choose. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think this has to be the best class I've taken at Yale. The assignments were all enjoyable to do as you had so much freedom; the midterm and final were both on a topic of your choice. Being able to dive deep into these films and find their cultural significance as well as investigate the aesthetic choices is incredibly helpful for any filmmakers and visual artists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
