            "\u00a0As a historical enthusiast of participatory democracy, \"Referendums and Democracy\" provided a more nuanced analysis of a particular democratic mechanism--referendums (not 'referenda')--than many perspectives have offered.  Rather than outright deference to or contempt for direct democracy, the course provided several historical examples that allow me to evaluate the importance of referendums that is critical, charitable, and more aware of political and social contexts.  That being said, the course also makes clear for me that many of the critiques of direct democracy can also be employed as critiques against democracy in all forms, including in representative systems.  It is here where the course, which analyzes a very specific few cases within a very specific subset of political mechanisms, extends its breadth beyond that which its title and explicit focus suggests. ",
            "\u00a0Ver interesting insight into the political mechanisms at work in referendums - not at all the overly specific (with risk of being gimmicky) course that I had feared from the title, this class really surveys the forces behind democracy, and the way that they can undermine the true sentiment of the people. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about international democratic systems, about democratic political theory, and the diversity of global referendums. I learned how to critically evaluate the holding of referendums around the world with regard to the strategic and institutional backdrops. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about both the political theory behind referendums as well as how referendums play out in practice -- this class did a good job combining case studies with broader theoretical discussions. I learned about the different elements of referendum campaigns and gained exposure to some of the literature about how voters make decisions -- i.e. what causes a voter to turn out to vote, how campaign rules and the media affect elections, whether people vote on first- or second-order issues. Also, going into this class, I did not know much about Brexit, and this class did a good job of teaching me specifically about what happened in the UK in 2016. ",
            "\u00a0Professor was very nice but only take this class if your interested in the material ",
            "\u00a0Ability to analyze and understand complex aspects of referendums. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the democratic theory and practice of referendums, analytic skills for evaluating referendums ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the normative justifications for referendums and different historical cases of referendums, primarily in Europe and Australia. Additionally, I learned lots about voter behavior in referendums and about the different incentives politicians might have to call a referendum. "

        [
            "\u00a0Professor Stokes provided ample room for evaluating the normative justifications of various referendums embedded within each of their respective contexts (This is literally the topic of the final essay), although this aspect of the course could perhaps be expanded since I found this element of the curriculum most powerful.  Twinned with this effort might be a greater share of class time devoted to contextualizing the case studies--it helps immensely when students have a clear and fairly comprehensive idea of what the Conservatives and the Labour Party stand for when trying to emulate a Brexit simulation--as well as a lightening of the emphasis on theorizing the strategic musings of individual politicians (e.g. Asking more of the social-historical processes that made Brexit politically palatable rather than \"Why do you think David Cameron decided to do this at this time?\"). ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting class and readings - but no idea what grade I will get considering the final paper is 50% and we only had three 2-page ungraded response papers prior to that! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the diversity of materials we read, which motivated the case studies nicely and provided useful insight into various aspects of referendums, including the involvement of political parties and the role of voting behavior and regulatory regimes. I also very much enjoyed the Brexit simulation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class does a good job of merging theoretical discussions with case studies of how referendums and campaigns functioned in the real world; the \"Brexit exercises\" (in-class simulations where students play different roles) were engaging, unique, and positive learning experiences; Professor Stokes is really knowledgeable and a good leader of class discussion; it taught me a good deal about Brexit, which is an important thing to know about; and it made me think deeply about larger issues of democracy -- this class was good at asking the big questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, I felt like the class dipped into different subject areas and was not always the most coherent/unified course -- sometimes we zoomed in on the details of one referendum, sometimes we talked about voter behavior and campaign strategy, sometimes we had broad discussions. This isn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't always clear going into each class session what we would be talking about. ",
            "\u00a0managable workload and solid seminar ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class for digging into the fascinating subject of referendums. Class discussion occasionally took some time to warm up, given the 9:25 time slot, but Professor Stokes was excellent and the material was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were great and of adequate length. I thought the varying structure of the class-including interactive lectures, traditional seminar discussions, and simulations-was quite refreshing. The short paper format was also very nice, as it forced you to engage more strongly with readings and helped you keep tabs on what you had learned as the semester progressed. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in studying questions of democratic theory and mechanisms of direct democracy in the context of representative systems.  Unfortunately, however, Professor Stokes will be at the University of Chicago by the time students are able to read this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - very approachable and informative political science seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think referendums are fascinating as both an extension of democratic theory and a political phenomenon, and this course helps us to understand how referendums have been used in representative systems. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who is particularly interested in Brexit or wants to learn about it; to someone who enjoys political science literature about voter behavior and thinking about the relationships between campaigns, the media, and voters; and to someone who wants to think hard about bigger questions about democracy and how we justify it. Referendums factor into politics/life more than you would think, and this class wasn't always as specific as its title would make you think -- it touches on a lot of big debates about democracy. That said, sometimes the focus on referendums can be limiting and not the most interesting. The class isn't the most organized week to week, but it all centers around the question \"When/why/under what circumstances are referendums justified?\" There are different reasons why you would/should want to answer that question, and if so, take the class. ",
            "\u00a0only if you are interested in referndums or brexit ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this was a great class on a fascinating subject with a minimal workload, would recommend as a solid seminar ",
            "\u00a0I would! It is a shame Professor Stokes is leaving, but the course material is still interesting! "
