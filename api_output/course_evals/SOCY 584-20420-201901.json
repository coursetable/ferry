            "\u00a0A vocabulary in helping to understand the present state of social communication and race relations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ethnography (what it is, methods, considerations) and about topics related to blackness and being black in the U.S. One of the main lessons was that slavery established the black body at the bottom of the social order in the U.S., and that much of the violence perpetrated against black bodies in this country reflect an attempt by (usually white) people to put black people in their \"place.\" This place is now sometimes conceptualized as the iconic ghetto. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a seminar, addressing racial inequality in urban centers. Through these discussions I learned many new concepts which I will use moving forward in my architectural work as I seek a way to respond to urban inequality with design. "

            "\u00a0It was nice to have a small class size, and I appreciated the contributions of our TA. I also appreciated Dr. Anderson's invitations for students to ask him questions about whatever, whenever. He created a friendly and open atmosphere, even as we discussed topics that can be very heavy. I did find some of the lectures to be repetitive, but I feel like I was able to quote Dr. Anderson nearly verbatim when I answered the first question, so clearly the repetition made some points sink in. ",
            "\u00a0I think more time for the students to discuss among themselves would be valuable. It was such a small class but I felt that I did not get a chance to speak with the others in the class and have discussions about each others' background. While the readings for the course are interesting, they took a lot of effort to complete each week, leaving little time to pursue my own research on the topic. Perhaps less given reading and more freedom to read different sources could contribute to an interesting dialogue. "
