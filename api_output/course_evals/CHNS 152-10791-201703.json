            "\u00a0My Chinese overall did improve substantially. ",
            "\u00a0My overall Chinese has improved. I've become more confident in my speaking, reading, and writing. I learned how to properly pronounce words, learned phrases useful to everyday speaking, wrote essays to improve my writing skills, and memorized characters that frequently show up. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new vocabulary words that helped me develop my reading, writing, and speaking abilities in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Wang Laoshi writes most of the lesson plans herself. Each one is very thoughtfully written and focuses on a topic that is highly relevant (such as Chinese holidays, \"tiger parenting,\" Chinese representation in government, Chinese cuisine, etc.) and the right balance of familiar/new vocabulary. I think this class is incredible for developing an understanding of not only the language, but also the culture and customs. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded vocabulary of Mandarin Chinese. New sentence structures. More experience speaking in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, improved my Chinese. It's designed to teach you more formal Chinese, lots of vocab/grammar structures that can only be used in writing, but there's also enough useful vocab thrown in there. ",
            "\u00a0My reading and writing skills improved greatly, and I learned about the culture and history of China. ",
            "\u00a0Organization and communication skills ",
            "\u00a0We learned extensive Chinese vocabulary and grammar patterns as well as knowledge about Chinese culture. "

        [
            "\u00a0Workload is high but very effective. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is that it helps students improve really quickly even after a few lessons. Because the class meets so frequently (5 days a week), we have the chance to practice what we've learned every day and get the chance to receive feedback so we can improve. Making the class heritage makes the environment more conducive to native speakers. There are no weaknesses of this course. It is a great course. Only negative is that the workload is very great because the class meets every day with daily quizzes to study for. However, it is all manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The passages that we read were mostly interesting and the various types of assignments we had (movie reviews, art museum presentation, etc.) made learning Chinese a very fun experience. I felt like I gained most from the essays we wrote and from the feedback given to us on our first drafts. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like the Voiceover project. It took too much time outside of class. Love the teacher, wish more people participated in class instead of just sitting there. ",
            "\u00a0Sentence structures were extremely difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Wang is an excellent teacher--hilarious and clearly very invested in her students' success. She designed the lessons herself (so no textbook), which I think was a definite strength; the lessons usually felt super relevant. That said, the class is designed to introduce you to formal grammar structures and vocab, so be ready to learn a lot of things that you can't use in daily conversation. This isn't necessarily a complaint, but be warned. Workload also isn't too bad, compared to other Chinese classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the daily classes really force you to engage with the material well and deeply, and the quick pace of the class means that that you quickly pick up and become comfortable with new vocabulary and syntax.\r\nWeaknesses- that also means a consistently demanding amount of homework every night. You cannot fall behind, and there's no room to push work back. ",
            "\u00a0High level of engagement; good atmosphere for participation "

        [
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you are willing to spend time on it every day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The professor who teaches the course is great and the material covered is relevant to the real world. Improvement comes quickly if you put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Wanglasohi is the best ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I would recommend this course to heritage speakers, especially those who speak Chinese at home but want to improve the technical side of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learning Chinese at Yale is never a bad idea, as long as you're willing to put in the effort. You WILL be more fluent at the end of it all. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in quickly advancing their Chinese abilities, and are aware and committed to putting in the considerable work and time necessary to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - your written Chinese and pronunciation will improve through this course; however, I wish we spent more time on high level listening and speaking. The debates we had in class could have been better if students were given homework the night before to prepare for the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- I came in having taken Chinese afterschool classes in elementary, so it had been a very long time since I'd taken a proper Chinese course, but I felt that the coursework was not only relevant to speaking to family/conversational purposes but helped us understand cultural aspects as well (art, film). Plus, our class got a lot closer by the end of the term and I'm very grateful for meeting a group of Chinese-American students to go through this learning experience with. "
