            "\u00a0I learned how to transliterate, translate, and parse hieroglyphics! I also learned quite a lot about Egyptian culture, how the scribes used to write and communicate, and just how the language changed throughout time. I definitely now have a pretty large vocabulary of hieroglyphic words and a lot of knowledge about the grammar and structure of the language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of Middle Egyptian grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly Egyptian grammar, a little bit of culture. Its very interesting to interpret such an old language. ",
            "\u00a0I lot of Egyptian grammar, and linguistic terms ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to approach a language with a structure and nature radically different to our own, and how to look at language analytically and structurally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of reading and writing middle Egyptian hieroglyphics, focusing on vocabulary, sentence structure, pronouns, and verb conjugation. We also gained insight into various historic texts through translation. "

            "\u00a0strengths -- well structured and a great environment for asking questions when I didn't understand something\r\n\r\nweaknesses -- did not fully/properly explain some complex grammars -- I felt like we would touch on something once for 20 minutes, not see it again for weeks, and then suddenly expect to know it on an assignment or exam. \r\n\r\nimprovement -- maybe spend more time going through complex grammar i.e. touching on it in multiple classes to help cement understanding; give handouts with examples of how to translate different verb forms, not just focusing on how to identify which verb form it is. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was a great class in that it was set up well with the exercises, real texts, and assignments. The class really allowed you to learn the language without really being overwhelmed but also still intrigued. It can be a bit confusing sometimes, but that's normal with any language. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved my integrating more Egyptian culture into the teaching of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Would be nice if they were able to get the grammar books for cheaper. But given the field that's unlikely. ",
            "\u00a0For an introductory language course, its pretty great ",
            "\u00a0Course is all around good. It'd say it is one of those things where you get out what you put in. Homework isn't graded, so you could just, like, not do it. But that is going to come back at you when you have a midterm and have to look up every other sign. So you if you give it your all and do all the assigned readings and homework, the workload will feel very high. Or you could do none of it and have a very low workload. I personally had other classes that sapped away my time, so I couldn't get as much out as I wanted to, but I learned regardless. ",
            "\u00a0The book used for grammar/vocab is not organized in the most cohesive fashion. However this is not really able to be changed since this is really the only book available for the course. The content is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It was well and clearly taught, and the level of engagement could be modified from student to student depending on how interested you were. However, it would have been good to have a little more accountability in our work (though it was a short term blessing). I would have liked to learn more about Ancient Egyptian culture and history in a more formal way, to base our knowledge of the language in something more complete. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is very well structured and taught and I like how the process of transliterating and translating is discussed in class. However, I think it would be beneficial if students were given more phrases to translate as practice on their own, once the lesson from the grammar book has been reviewed in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially for students who are interested in dead languages! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's incredibly interesting and just such a cool language to take if you really want to do something different. The language really makes you think, and it teaches you a different way of thinking and a very cool skill. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class as an engaging language credit. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, you either have waited your whole life for this opportunity or desperately need a language that only meets twice a week. But do take it, it's so cool and the class is very laid back. It is not a gut! The language is bizarre and frequently it feels more like a code breaking class. But tons of fun! And very satisfying ",
            "\u00a0Sure! I cant say its the most practical, but its engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If they have any interest in Egyptology, yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Don't be discouraged to take this just because it's an esoteric subject! Egyptian is a wonderful language that isn't taught everywhere, so take up on this opportunity if you're at all interested. It can be frustrating at times, but that's just a fact of language learning. It does feel grammar heavy, but with enough practice the syntactic constructions start to feel easier to translate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the language is well taught and interesting to learn for anyone interested in antiquity. ",
            "\u00a0probably, definitely if they have a pre-existing interest in ancient Egypt, or in language or linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0While I found the course enjoyable, I would only suggest it for people already interested in languages and/or ancient Egypt already. There are readings and translations you have to do on your own, and I can see it becoming tedious without the motivation fueled by wanting to learn more about the subject. "
