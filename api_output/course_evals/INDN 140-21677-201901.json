The class is already great, but if there was one thing to add it would be more conversational in class activities. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a great opportunity to keep learning Indonesian and gain more insight into the culture. Bu Dinny is an amazing professor and is so supportive. During L4, you get the chance to have engaging classes like a cooking class. You also have the opportunity to pursue your own interests and complete projects on topics of your choice. The class involves a lot of conversation with your peers which makes it engaging and fun. Definitely take this class! "
