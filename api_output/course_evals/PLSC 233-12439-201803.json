In doing so, I also learned how to analyze and answer constitutional questions myself. This class was interesting in that it relied on textual analysis as well as social and political history to explain why different cases were decided in certain ways during different historical moments, beyond just what was written in the Constitution. I liked hearing about Professor Amar's experience, thought the TA's were incredible, and am glad I got this overview of constitutional law before graduating. ",

Madison, etc, using certain \"modalities\" (structural, textual, historical, precendent, etc.). The class starts off pretty strong, but by the second half, lectures become pretty rambly. Prof. Amar is clearly very knowledgeable, but the way he lectures is not always that accessible. I will say though, this is a very good class to cr/d. Both the midterm and final are open notes, and besides that, you just have a short paper. On the other hand, if you really want to dive into the course, there's still a lot of depth to the case analyses. ",

This was a really good introduction to constitutional law and I'm told that Prof. Amar teaches it almost exactly the same way he teaches it at the law school. That does mean that we focused on certain areas of the law more than others--we talked a lot about the Reconstruction Amendments, Congress's Commerce Clause power and substantive due process. We also talked about separation of powers and executive privilege at the start of the course and about sex discrimination and the privacy line of cases towards the end of the course. I got a lot of practice reading Supreme Court opinions and getting an idea of the kinds of arguments that justices make. Another cool part of this class was that Amar would often talk about current constitutional law issues that came up in the news (of which there was a lot this semester) and give us his take. ",

Also gives you a semi chronological history of rights movements, beginning with abolition through LGBTQ rights in the constitution. Hit all the major con law cases. By the end of the course I felt extremely competent in my ability to apply the constitution and make judgements on the constitutionality of anything thrown my way.

            "\u00a0The content was interesting, and the cases that we read were important to understanding the basics of constitutional law. Lectures were unorganized, which meant that Professor Amar spent a disproportionate amount of time on one or two cases and did not cover a majority of reading material, despite the fact that the cases he missed or skimmed over were important to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are its relevance to current events, Amar and the TFs, and the breadth of material covered.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Toward the end of the course, there's too much reading assigned. Perhaps it could be streamlined. Not much of it is covered in class, so it's superfluous rather than helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The Teaching Fellows are vital to this course.  They are wonderful.  Professor Amar is a brilliant historian, and cares very deeply about the course and the students, but his lectures were often confusing or difficult to follow.  I wish he would outline some sort of structure for each lecture. ",

But Professor Amar's passion for the material was clear and lectures were usually engaging. I think the syllabus could have been organized a bit better because it wasn't typically clear what we needed to have read on a weekly basis, but now that the semester is over I understand the thematic flow of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting historical perspective, TAs are amazing\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are all over the place, not much gained from going to class, most of the learning comes from section ",

GO TO SECTION! \r\nWeaknesses: In an effort to keep lectures \"ripped from the headlines\" Amar often goes off topic. He spent a couple lectures talking about Kavanaugh, which was not particularly constructive. He doesn't follow the structure of the syllabus perfectly and sometimes is hard to follow (if you haven't done the readings carefully). But theres a ton of reading and that happens. Use your TAs to clear up the questions you have following lectures. ",

I wish less time was spent on the more foundational units of the course, and more on the later units  especially because the later units required much more reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nAmar's a big deal, and he knows it, and he acts like it.\r\nThe TAs are amazing and they're the best law school students at YLS and that is an impressive statement.\r\nIt's absurdly relevant. From the Nixon cases (Trump), appointment power cases (Kavanaugh hearings - oh, he testified there by the way), presidential power (Muslim ban executive order), to NFIB v. Sebelius (the Obamacare/Affordable Care Act case -- oh, and this week some Texas judge just ruled the ACA unconstitutional), and more, it will absolutely be one of if not the most relevant to real political life classes you ever take.\r\nThe lunches he goes with students to are 10/10. Actually go. Guests drop in. Big time guests. Like the CEOs of elite law firms, professors at YLS, top policy aides, and Evan Wolfson (one of if not the most influential figures in the nationwide legalization of gay marriage) just drop in on occasion. It's worth it.\r\nThe actual stuff you read is a LOT if you actually read it all but the vast majority of it is very interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAmar's a big deal, and he knows it, and he acts like it.\r\nThere is an obscene amount of reading. It's essentially impossible to do it all -- that try hard, YLS-or-bust kid you know? They won't read it all. \r\nAmar assigns 5 of his own books. You for sure have to purchase the casebook (~$275 I wanna say), the others you should just rent, but honestly you truly only need to read the casebook, America's Unwritten Constitution, and America's Constitution: A Biography. I wouldn't even rent the others, and instead purchase AUC/ABAC and annotate them. ",

Soren's section is where I really digested and understood the material, and meeting with him throughout the semester allowed me to ask questions and dive deeper into the material. This is what made the course worthwile.\r\n\r\nProf. Amar cares about teaching and his students a lot and is a passionate lecturer. However, often his passion for the materials occludes the content as his lectures jump around. It doesn't help that the readings are blocked weeks at a time, and so it's hard to know what readings to do for which class. I know Prof. Amar adapts the timeline of the course to current events etc, however it would be helpful if he posted online a more detailed reading schedule that he kept up to date. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: You will really learn a lot. The exams almost become enjoyable if you know your stuff and are interested in the subject.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not truly an accessible course. @FGLI students -- beware that the books Amar asks you to buy for this course are not cheap. I think it is also disingenuous for the course to pretend that all the books are required. Frankly, the casebook is the only thing you need. ",

            "\u00a0There should really be slides or something for lecture. Amar would often ramble and it was very difficult to keep track of what he was saying and whether it was relevant or not. Also, the amount of reading expected of students is absolutely absurd - the only way someone could accomplish it is if they had no other commitments. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, but they were quite disconnected from the exams.  Everything we learned in lecture was helpful to the exam, and everything we read was helpful to the exam, but there was no guidance as to how to approach the exam unless you attended the optional review sessions.  There was also no standardized guidance for the paper - luckily, my TF was very helpful about the paper once you had an idea, but there was no guidance as to where to begin. ",
            "\u00a0GO TO SECTION\r\nThe class would be better if there was section then lecture. The section tells you what the case is about, lecture gives you ways to think about it. With the lecture first, you end up missing a lot of Amar's brilliant points. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion section, being complimentary to lecture discussions and providing clarity for the material covered during lecture, aided in learning constitutional law. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TFs are dedicated to teaching students and as law students, are very familiar with the work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Amar's lectures are very unstructured. I've had problems keeping up what he was saying because most of it is stream of consciousness. He really provided historical oversight while my TF taught me the cases. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The sheer amount of reading means we learn a lot about constitutional law. I definitely know more than I did a semester ago about constitutional principles, the powers of each branch, and the constitutional take hot topic issues like abortion and affirmative action. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The reading often felt overwhelming, and in retrospect, not all of it was necessary. Also, I firmly believe that only attending lecture (and not section) would make this class impossible; I don't think the lecture on its own can prepare someone for the course. ",

            "\u00a0Great course. ",
            "\u00a0The material was amazing, I feel like I will be a better citizen for having taken this course!  A weakness was the reading load - it was intense.  I believe that the course would be served better by reduced readings (so that deeper thought could take place on the topics covered). ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting lectures, well-run sections, and enjoyable exams. One weakness may be the sudden increase in pace after the midterm, but otherwise great. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. I LOVED going to section it really helped to clarify things that were ambiguous in lecture. My biggest complaint is that lecture tended to be VERY scattered and it was really hard to take notes because there were so many tangents that it was hard to follow the main point of what was going on. (Why section was SO important) ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was fantastic. Professor Amar is a brilliant lecturer, who presents the course material clearly. I cannot think of any ways the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Professor Amar involving current events into the lecture when a big event had occurred. ",
            "\u00a0The underlying material is very good and some lectures are fantastic, but others get extremely repetitive, which results in us speeding through some parts of the syllabus and spending far too much time on others ",
            "\u00a0Amar has it down. ",
            "\u00a0I think one major strength of this course are the TAs. You really learn the most in section, since they actually break down cases in a way that's understandable. However, if you don't have a good TA, you have a much worse experience. One weakness of the course are lectures. Although Professor Amar is clearly a well-respected legal expert, his lectures are unorganized and full of grandstanding and barely disguised elitism. Another major strength of this course is the content. It is really engaging and covers a spectrum of constitutional issues. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Amar is a great lecturer and that was a big strength of the course. I thought that he made going to class super interesting, and the syllabus was constructed so that we talked about some pretty interesting cases and aspects of the Constitution. I also liked that Prof. Amar gave a lot of historical and political context for some of the cases because I think that definitely helps you understand them and their impact. Personally I found the readings really interesting and genuinely enjoyed reading all of the opinions, and the lectures definitely helped me see their most important parts and think about the arguments that the justices were making critically and in the context of past precedent and what further implications their reasoning would have for later cases. \r\n\r\nI can't speak for other sections, but my TA was really good and super great about meeting with us outside of class if we had questions or wanted to talk about anything law-related, so the fact that section wasn't a drag was another plus about the course. There was one required paper and an optional final paper (in addition to the exams) and we were given a lot of freedom in choosing what to write about.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amar holds weekly lunches in a dining hall after class and I would definitely recommend going to them. I certainly didn't agree with Amar about everything he said and he's definitely a pretty opinionated person, but he's also very influential in the realm of constitutional law and it was nice that he made himself available to us and was happy to answer more questions so I think it's worth taking advantage of that. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I do think that we spent a little too much time on some of the Civil War-era cases and the Youngstown/Civil War distinction because this was something that Amar just got really excited about and wanted to make sure he drove home. I think this meant that we were a little rushed towards the end of the course, even though we were mostly on track with the syllabus for most of the semester, so we didn't get to spend quite as much time on some of the affirmative action, sex discrimination and privacy cases that came up towards the end. We also had the sexual orientation line of cases on the syllabus but barely talked about them in class at all. Overall, though, we spent a lot of time on different things and got a great overview to a few really important areas of constitutional law, even if an intro course like this can't be fully comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amar makes an effort to talk about current events that relate to constitutional law, the cases are very interesting and well laid out\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: SO much reading, Amar does not talk that much about the cases themselves and so it is sometimes hard to appreciate the nuances when he assumes we have foundational knowledge that many of us lacked ",
            "\u00a0Sections are absolutely amazing, and they were the best part of the class, particualrly if you did all the reading. \r\nProfessor Amar was the weakness of this course, particualrly in his uncomfortable combative lectures on contemporary politics (I walked out because I was uncomfortable in a lecture he spent most of the time speaking of Kavanaugh during). He also lectured in a slightly disorganized manner, but was generally engaging otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Akhil Reed Amar is brilliant, engaging, and wise, and it's a privilege to take his class. His lectures are reason enough to take this class even if you aren't interested in pursuing a career related to law or politics. (If you are, it's a must-take!)\r\nWeaknesses: The readings for this class are ridiculously dense and lengthy, so you have to be strategic about which cases or parts of cases you read. Amar doesn't really engage with you on this, of course, but you can ask your TA how to identify what's critical and just focus on those cases. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be fine with  less reading. ",
            "\u00a0Its up to the student to do the readings. that defines the class. It works for some, but not so much for other. Very easy to fall behind on. ",
            "\u00a0Amar's lectures are all over the place. He goes on long tangents, but once you understand his style the lectures are very enjoyable. I did the vast majority of my learning in section (which is essential) and attended lecture to enjoy Amar's tirades. Strengths are definitely the YLS Section TFs, and Amar's general enthusiasm for the content. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this course was the sections. I was taught by Benjamin Hand who was a fantastic teacher. My recommendation would actually be to increase section length.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this class is professor Amars lecture style. He lectures are very unstructured, rambling, and hard to follow. I have a lot of respect for his knowledge of the subject, but I think more can be done to improve the communication of that knowledge to students. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of introducing people to how to read a case, with Amar spending a couple of lectures going through McCulloch v. Maryland in order to spell out how cases should be read. The course does have a lot of reading, but in general its not difficult to gain the understanding of the cases from skimming the cases rather than doing all of the required reading. It would be more helpful in class if a bit more attention could be paid to the important sections of the cases, rather than just diving in immediately to the context and deeper reasoning, as at times it would be confusing where Amar had intended to take the lecture having not had the same background and foresight into the material as him. In addition, while I appreciated how Amar would tie in current events, he did spend a very solid amount of time talking about his opinions on the Kavanaugh hearings (which in it of themselves I didn't mind hearing, but it did take about 1-1.5 classes to get through his thoughts), which then took time away from other material (like covering Korematsu, for instance). ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be more organized ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that lectures were always eye-opening and fascinating with section being one of my favorite portions of the class due to the fact that a lot of the discussions and cases were clarified during that time. One weakness is that the professor spent uneven amounts of time going over the cases so we understood some concepts extremely thoroughly and well while others were briefly mentioned in section or not discussed at all, resulting in a lot of self studying for both exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great lectures, great discussion sections and super interesting material\r\nWeaknesses - somewhat confusing syllabus: we werent always exactly sure what readings we would be covering in lecture ",

            "\u00a0This is a really wonderful course in all respects. Amar is a very engaging professor who didn't shy away from difficult current topics in Constitutional Law. The one weakness of this class are the readings--there's simply too much to read and not enough time. I found myself frequently needing to look up synopses of cases, and often didn't read the secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Extremely competent people teaching the section who were clear and concise instructors. Give em a hand. Amar seemed to very rarely teach Con Law, however, choosing instead to rhapsodize on American history or exceptionalism rather than anything else. ",

            "\u00a0The response paper is a big weakness: It needs to be made clear how this will be graded. I was told that it was \"low-key\" and just a \"general reaction to whatever we wanted,\" by my TA. A few of my friends reported the same thing. The grading on the response paper was harsh. I wish that would've been more clear, and I would have put much more effort into it. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely had a lot of reading and was heavier towards the end. Sometimes Professor Amar went on tangents but in general the lectures were interesting. But the real gem of this course is section. Travis was an amazing TA and section was great for ironing out the concepts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent, and I appreciated the intuitive approach to Constitutional Law. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures can be a little hard to follow and there is far too much reading. I think having a good section/TA is key to enjoying the course and effectively synthesizing the mass of information it throws at you. Fortunately, I had an incredible TA, and as far as I can tell Professor Amar chooses his TAs well. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered so much material in one semester. We started very slowly, which I think was a good thing, learning to analyze Supreme Court cases and getting used to applying the right frame of reference to best understand constitutional issues and make arguments. The weakness is that it was sometimes difficult to follow where we were in the course because it moved fast and we would occasionally get sidetracked in lectures; we might have tried to cover too much material. However I found these detours very interesting, which is why i think the material on the syllabus should be pared down instead. I found that there was significant mismatch between what we would talk about in lectures and what we should up on the exams.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of this course are really Amar and the TAs. They were all excellent and very knowledgeable and willing to help. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Amar is excellent and he should just keep doing his thing, but more time could be spent on the historical context of the cases. Also, at times the course moved too slow (especially at the beginning) but the second half of the course was pretty rapid. ",
            "\u00a0The course is relatively well organized into discrete sections of constitutional law. The optional section is essential to understanding the cases discussed, especially when the speed of the course picks up and we can't get to them all in lecture. The tests are kind of fun, honestly -- they are issue spotters, requiring you to pick up on previously discussed constitutional issues in novel situations. The grading is mostly fair.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reading load is often overbearing, so if you plan to read each individual case in its entirety and really delve into the depths of constitutional law, get ready for some long nights. luckily, online resources exist to help you get the general gist, which should be enough to get you by in the class. It just depends what you're looking for: a deep understanding of constitutional law, or a decent grade in the class. Additionally, Professor Amar's lectures are often confusing and lack structure. He frequently goes on long, unrelated tangents or simply doesn't discuss the readings or constitutional law at all. It's hard to follow along with where we are in the syllabus, or what we're supposed to have read. There is no powerpoint or anything like that, so it's difficult to understand what the most important concepts are to take away from the class. Additionally, Amar sometimes says kind of problematic things (this year, mainly regarding the accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or racial tensions) and gets really aggressive when challenged on them. This was kind of upsetting to a lot of students, especially many women and POC, and made a collaborative, productive learning experience difficult for many. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are by far the best part of the class. I learned so much from Professor Amar--he challenges the liberal orthodoxy on a number of issues, and always has great hot takes. I find myself wanting to ask him questions about controversial topics when they come up in the news. He brings clarity and lots of context to every issue. Because lectures were so important for me, I wish there were a way to separate the laptop note takers from the non laptop note takers, a la Psych and the Good Life. It was very distracting to see my peers surfing the internet during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course can be rather boring as Professor Amar tends to go on tangents that don't relate to the course and he's not always the most engaging lecturer. That being said, if you take this course, treat the sections as the course and the lectures as the supplements because the TAs do a much better job of walking you through the cases whereas lecture gives you a sort of historical overview (sometimes). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a wide array of materials; gaining a new perspective of history \r\n\r\nWeakness: lecture is badly designed to prepare students for exams; sections are very popular but should be mandatory; there should be a better/more structured  curriculum to teach the skills necessary for the exams ",
            "\u00a0Section was beyond helpful to understanding the course material. But sometimes the exams felt tangential to the course material because you just might have focused your studying on areas that did not appear on the issue spotters. ",

I did well in the class nonetheless because he goes over a lot in lecture, but I wish I had more time to engage with the texts. Overall, there is so much content so sometimes it did feel like we spent too little time on important themes. ",

It brings in history and political science for a more well-rounded understanding of the political instruments. The take-home element of the test takes off the pressure for rote memory. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you choose to do all the readings and the research paper, the workload is heavy. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion sections were absolutely invaluable to go over lecture material. The lectures were quite informative and interesting but at times it felt like Amar was spending too much time reviewing material from the previous lecture. He also got off the schedule, which made it even more difficult to try to keep up with the reading. The reading that we were assigned was barely manageable in the beginning of the course and frankly became impossible. Indeed, the casebook reading by itself was substantial, with the additional books by Prof. Amar difficult to find time for. I would be very interested to know how many people did all of just the casebook reading, and I bet it is very few. The readings can and should be less, more targeted to what we cover in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0S: open note/book exams, very fair assignments\r\nW: syllabus was hard to follow in terms of knowing what each class was going to address, some classes seemed to me more of extended tangents that did not relate to the topic at hand ",

However, I thought that the lectures sometimes were too repetitive and focused too heavily on tangents instead of the cases themselves. And, since Professor Amar only assigned books that he had written, we were exposed to very few opinions and interpretations of the Constitution outside of Professor Amar's own, which is not ideal for an introductory course.

",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amars sweeping and clever lectures, very knowledgeable and accomplished TAs, and a sense that you are fulfilling your civic duty by understanding our government and judicial system. Ties to current events and enhances students understanding of the U.S political system. Weaknesses: The course should give more information about the midterm before the exam. Sample answers to past exams would be extremely helpful. Despite attending the review sessions and listening to TAs advice, I had little sense of what the midterm would require before taking it. "

I recommend taking the section, as my TA Travis was excellent, and because it does a good job of focusing on the information on which you may actually be assessed. In my experience, the grading has been fair. Exams are flexible- you can either take a short or long version, depending on your preferred assessment method. The workload for the exams and essay is relatively light; however, there are a LOT of readings. I think this course is ideal for sophomores and juniors- I wish I had taken it earlier, as I probably would have applied to law school, but c'est la vie.

Even if you're not interested in American history or going to law school, if you live in this country and follow politics at all it provides a really helpful overview about how court cases are decided and what some of the most influential ones have taught us. It's a fine credit/d option because it is hard to keep up with all of the reading but easy to learn and appreciate the material just by going to lecture and section. Some of the work is optional, as is section, but you should definitely enroll in a section if you take the class because the TAs are incredible and basically break down the lecture material so that you can really understand the big takeaways from each week.

That said, it is incredibly easy to fall behind on the readings. Workload is manageable- midterm with take-home option, 5-page response paper, final with take-home option, and an optional paper.

            "\u00a0This course is incredible.  I highly recommend it.  You should feel comfortable taking it for a letter grade if you're willing to invest the time/effort in doing the readings.  But even if you just take it Cr/D/F (if knowing this makes you feel more confident: it's very easy this way), Con Law is an absolutely wonderful learning experience and will contribute substantially to the quality of your liberal education. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but go to section!!! That is where you really learn Con Law. Also, don't be afraid to challenge Amar's ideas. He is very smart, but treats his own opinions as objective facts and more students should challenge that. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! This was my favorite class that I have taken at Yale so far and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I think some of this is personal preference since it turned out that I just really enjoyed reading the court opinions and thinking about how they all fit together to form the court's jurisprudence. But I would recommend it to anyone interested in American politics because it gives you another perspective from which to think about policy decisions, as well as a perspective on the interplay between courts and policymakers over America's history. If you know you're interested in the law or in America's judiciary  at all then it's definitely a great course to take. Amar is a really good teacher and his lectures are really engaging, so even if you don't agree with him about everything you can still learn a lot from him (it also makes sense to understand what his views are because he's so well-known in the field). I know that a lot of people take this course credit/D because there's so much reading, so I think that could be one way to go if you're concerned about it, but I didn't think it had as heavy a workload as that reputation implies. The readings can be time consuming if you do them all, but outside of the readings there were just two exams and one paper (plus an optional paper) to worry about. On way or the other, take it for sure because it's a really cool Yale experience to take advantage of and it'll teach you a lot about a subject that is super relevant to understanding U.S. politics on a deeper level! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It is incredibly useful and if you actually put the work in, you will get so much out. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to course to someone who wants to do the casebook reading and engage in the course. It was very fulfilling to really engage with the material (and immensely helped during Amar's disorganized lectures). ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are at all interested in law or politics or if you want to learn from THE leading constitutional scholar! It's a privilege just to take this class; Amar is brilliant and has tons and tons of valuable insights to offer about everything from Lincoln to the Civil Rights Movement to present supreme court nominations (although his opinions on current issues can be controversial, he's so smart, it's worth listening and forming your own opinions). ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. It's a lot of reading, but not actually that hard. Amar is a legend, and very smart, but very opinionated. ",
            "\u00a0Knowing about our constitution and how the cases regarding it have led to the way our nation and its legal system works today is important for any student. The course is constantly engaging and interesting, and though it's a lot of reading, you can easily pick and choose what to read. I took the course Credit/D/fail, and I was able to learn a lot while only doing the readings that interested me. ",
            "\u00a0If interested in case law, this course is essential. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have any interest in law or legal history. ",
            "\u00a0A must take. Seriously. At a minimum audit/credit/d this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely one of the must-take courses if you are interested in politics, political science, of if you've wanted to learn more about the Constitution and constitutional law. You will like your TA more than Amar, but Amar nevertheless is a great storyteller and has the memory to really incorporate a variety of contexts to the material at hand. Definitely has potential to be a good 5th class or Credit/D class, but keep in mind that there are a lot of cases to go through, but they're worth it if you enjoy the work. Most of the grade is contingent on the two tests (both open-internet, and with both in class and take home options), but an optional research paper makes the grading structure more even if one of the tests doesn't go well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, extremely insightful and inspiring ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in understanding the political foundations of the country and the legal system. ",
            "\u00a0Yes most definitely! A great, challenging course where you will learn a ton about constitutional interpretation and structure. Definitely one of my most enjoyed classes at Yalesuper interesting and very rewarding. I feel like i learned a lot and developed my own critical thinking skills with regard to constitutional interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is unlike any other class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone and everyone. Do not be scared off by the workload! You can cut corners, and the class is so impactful that I'd suggest people do whatever they need to to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it can be interesting, I guess. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS ",
            "\u00a0No because Akhil Amar is one of the worst professors I've ever come across at Yale. If it was just the TAs it would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Important for any American to have a grasp on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only to credit D. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. Lots of work though. It's really tough to get an A. Just remember, you're being graded by 2nd/3rd year law students at one of the best law schools in the world on subjects they're all well-versed in. Don't take this if you're going for a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0100% without a doubt, no questions asked, oh yes should you take this course. There is a reason it has the reputation it has, so don't be one of the rebels who thinks it's taught poorly and by someone who is \"arrogant\". Professor Amar is a gem, and, while obviously confident in his knowledge and in himself, he offers students one of the most remarkable opportunities to become an educated citizen. Even if you're not an American, the modalities you learn and the cases you discuss will shape your view of the world and give you amazing insight into how laws affect us daily. Yes there are law snakes in the class, and yes there are people who credit/D it and barely learn anything, but don't let these tropes tramp your style. DO the readings (only the casebook is relevant), GO to section, GO to class, and you'll learn so much. It's that simple. take constitutional law with amar. (drops the mic) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in law. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly. This class is much more manageable than publicly perceived and was the highlight of my semester. I came to every single class enthusiastic and left with my mind blown. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if you're actually willing to put in at least a modicum of work. Taking this course Cr/D allows you to do nearly nothing for most of the semester, than just crunch before the exams to get a passing grade. That might work, but ultimately you won't get much out of the course and it'll largely feel like a waste of time. Without doing even some of the readings or at least attaining a baseline understanding of the cases covered, lecture will be nigh incomprehensible (Amar is good, but his proclivity for tangents clutters his lectures, almost rendering them impenetrable absent a basic familiarity with the case under discussion). Actually investing in the class is far, far more rewarding.  It gives you an actual opportunity to do law, and if you're anything like me, you'll find that immensely enjoyable. The course material is genuinely fascinating, and the exams are fun puzzles. If you put in the work, you'll get something lasting out of the class--both the theory of constitutional law and its application. Both involve copious amounts of history, political science, and analytical thinking. As for the lectures: they vary in quality (inspirational/mind-blowing at best and bewildering at worst), but Professor Amar's contagious enthusiasm and passion is constant. That alone makes them worth attending. Also, and this is THE MOST IMPORTANT aspect of this class, go to section and get a good TA. Your TA will be the one helping you connect the dots, guiding you throughout the course, and grading your exams and paper. Choose your TA wisely. That choice will potentially define your experience. I was very fortunate to get an incredible TA. I doubt I would have loved the course as much as I did without his section. \r\n\r\nSo, highly recommended, but only if you aren't afraid from putting in some work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Contrary to popular belief, this course isn't really a ton of work. There's a midterm, a short paper, and a final. Don't get caught off guard by the midterm and final, plan out your studying early because there's so much stuff to cover. The readings take a lot of time, but as long as you learn to skim and identify the important parts, it's totally manageable. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale, if not my favorite. Amar shares his very opinionated and well-argued point of view on the history of the Constitution, which made lectures entertaining. I think every American citizen or resident living in the U.S. should make an effort to understand Constitutional law, and this class will help you do that if you put the effort in. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in Con Law, or who want to get a better understanding of how to approach analysis of legal texts in general. If you're going to take the class, though, take the section. It's absolutely essential to understanding what you're talking about in class, especially when the speed of the course picks up and Amar starts talking about unrelated topics for much of lecture. However, the tests are fair and fun, the topics are interesting, and if you're okay doing a lot of reading about law, you should do fine. If you know you're interested in law, or even if you want to explore this passion, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. Just showing up to lecture will teach you SO much about the Constitution, American history, and events going on in the news. My favorite class at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Classic course. Amar's lectures can be hard to follow, but the TA-led sections are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you have an interest in constitutional law or just law school in general take this course. Even if you don't plan to go to law school you should take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student willing to have little exam prep but is passionate about constitutional history and is enjoys constitutional argumentation ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super interesting and important given the current political climate. I learned a ton about Constititional Law. ",
            "\u00a0I would really recommend this class! Even if you don't know anything about the constitution, he is such an engaging lecturer and he makes it super interesting! It feels like a course everyone should take, especially if you're even barely considering law school. It could be one of those classes that turns bio majors into polisci majors!! Don't be scared by the increased workload and intellectual difficulty, he really wants to make sure his students learn, so don't be intimidated. He makes himself very accessible to office hours and after class lunches/discussion, so if you are lost you can take advantage of having a leading constitutional/law scholar at your fingertips! I did literally 0 readings and I'm pretty sure I did just fine in the class-- just go to lecture and you'll really be fine! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. You will start thinking about famous cases and American history from a different perspective once you have the knowledge from this class. Also, section is really interesting for students interested in studying law - you will be challenged to consider your argument very closely in a comfortable environment. But I would recommend keeping up with the readings, even though theyre a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is one of those Yale courses you have to take. Before this course, I felt ill-equipped to have an opinion about U.S. politics and government checks and balances, but this course will give you all the history and terminology needed to have one! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a fascinating subject and you will learn a lot about the constitution. Don't be scared off by the significant reading. As long as you attend lecture and go to section, there is really no need to do all of it. ",
            "\u00a0If someone is interested in law or constitutional issues, I would recommend this course as a general introduction into the topics. I did not take section with this course, but I imagine my engagement would have been stronger had I enrolled in section. I have heard from many students who loved the class - I did not love it, but it was okay. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in Constitutional law, but perhaps not if they want to rigorous intro to it. The course seems to meander and I often felt unengaged with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it gives you the knowledge and language to understand the Constitution and current Constitutional issues of the past and in our time. If you think you might be interested in law school, this is also a great course to begin to learn about the law and to engage with law students (the TAs). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it provides foundational knowledge that will help me to be a better member of my society. The readings are compelling and every lecture was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it puts you outside of your comfort zone but provides enough support to learn about a  really relevant and important topic. It also provides a good introduction to what a law school class is like and what it is like to study the law. ",
            "\u00a0Dont take it for fun. But take it if you think you might be interested in law! Take the section. I could sit in that section for 4 hours a week and not get bored! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in attending law school, this is a great feeler course. If you're not pre-law, I would also suggest taking this course because learning about the American constitution/constitutional rights will be valuable no matter your profession. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Con Law is rigorous, but it is so rewarding and worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I enjoyed lectures, and Amars words will stick in my head. Sections were interesting and well taught (Peter Beck was a fantastic teacher, though this was his last year as a TA. Shop around.). The exams were based on thinking, not memorization: theyre open note/open internet, so you must make legal arguments using the information available. I learned during the exams. If you want to take it CR/D, you can do little to no work. To take it for a grade, go to lecture, read as much as you can (case book first, then Amars ACAB, AUC), pay careful attention in section, and study hard for exams. "
