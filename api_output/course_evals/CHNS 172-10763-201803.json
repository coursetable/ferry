            "\u00a0I improved my Chinese writing and speaking skills, and learned a lot about China's culture, politics, and history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss history, world politics, etc. in Chinese, which was incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a much more nuanced picture of various problems and aspects of modern China and Chinese society, and the Chinese language skills to discuss these issues. The course was definitely a good continuation of previous Chinese courses I had taken. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook for this course and thus the course itself focuses on various aspects of contemporary China. I gained a greater understanding of many aspects of modern Chinese politics, such as the issues of Taiwan, internet censorship and democracy. Furthermore, I was exposed to a vast amount of vocabulary that is relative to these topics, allowing me to hopefully discuss them at a higher level in Chinese in the future. I would say aside from the vocabulary and overall familiarity with Chinese society, what this course really imparts is a glimpse into issues from a Chinese perspective. Much of the news I consume portrays China through the lens of an American worldview, and it is interesting to look at how Chinese people view the same facts differently. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my formal Chinese reading + writing. Also was pleasantly surprised to have learned a little history on Chinese characters and a lot on current issues facing China. ",
            "\u00a0I was worried about taking this class because like most heritage speakers, my listening and speaking were much higher than my reading. However, I improved my reading and writing lightspeed by taking this class, and by the end of the class I was already writing papers in Chinese on advanced topics. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to read the exam but after practicing and studying a lot I was able to easily read the exam by the end of the semester. I also learned a lot more political and academic vocabulary that while might not be used in normal conversation, is necessary for writing essays in Chinese for a more academic audience. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed not only learning the language, but learning about China itself and the issues surrounding it. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the relaxed structure of the course, but I think it could be slightly more structured (maybe it could meet more than twice a week as well). ",
            "\u00a0The class is run similarly to any of the other Chinese language learning classes at Yale, so there are no completes about the structure of the course or how the course is run. Zhang Laoshi is a great and interesting teacher, and the textbook and in class discussion are all interesting. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are that I wish I could've gotten more out of the course. How much your Chinese can improve is limited by the fact that the class only meets twice a week. Concrete steps to improve this aspect of the course would be to meet three times a week (I even think it may be helpful to have three 50 minute sessions vs. two 75 minute sessions, but three 75 minute sessions would also be great honestly). Another thing would be to institute individual tutorial like the lower level courses do. Overall, I just needed more time to practice speaking in the class, and to apply the grammar and words we learned in class to topics other than that discussed directly in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength of this class is the textbook, which Zhang Laoshi helped write, incidentally. I would say the biggest weakness of this class is the small amount of time we have to discuss in class. The content of this course is very conducive to discussion, and it was a shame that we did not have more opportunities to converse in Chinese. With that said, it is difficult to see how we could work in more time for discussion while still covering the necessary vocabulary and grammar structures every week. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Zhang is amazing, and the book is pretty good if you're interested in learning about China from Chinese scholars' perspective. The class might be little too unstructured for some, since Prof Zhang sometimes gets too excited, accidentally rambles a lot and loses track of time, but his insights are interesting, so I didn't mind. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very focused on speaking and understanding difficult essays written by professors. A strength is that the textbook has recordings of the readings that made it much easier for me as someone whose listening ability is much higher than reading. This made reading the textbook and preparing for class much easier for me. A weakness of the course is that there is so many characters to memorize. We were expected to memorize around 200-300 characters per week. I've never taken a Yale Chinese class before, so this was a lot. However, the professor is much better and kinder than what I've heard other Chinese professors are like. It is definitely a class with a lot of workload and I would devote entire weekends only to preparing for this class, but is worth it to improve your Chinese to a more advanced level. The professor wrote the textbook himself. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This course was incredibly interesting and Professor Zhang is great. I enjoyed the readings and I learned so much about China. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Zhang laoshi is great and the textbook is super interesting. Class discussions are also great. I will say, though, that the class is super chill and enjoyable and you learn a lot, however the midterm and final were so much harder than expected and the professor really downplayed how hard they were gonna be. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student simply because it is well taught, well organized, and is the highest level Chinese course currently available at Yale. If you want to keep improving your Chinese, this is the course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. Zhang Laoshi is a wonderful teacher who has no shortage of interesting stories or \"hot takes.\" Make sure to ask him how he feels about traditional Chinese medicine. The workload for this course is fairly light, although I will say that you will definitely retain more of the vocabulary the more time you spend going over it. Regardless of how much of the vocabulary that sticks with you after, the insight you gain into modern China itself, and the opportunity to look at certain issues from a Chinese perspective makes this course a worthwhile one to take. If you do take the class, be warned that there were sections on both the midterm and final with fill-in-the-blank chengyu's, which was probably the hardest part of the class. You can make educated guesses when it comes to normal vocabulary, but it's a lot harder with chengyu's. Keep that in mind when you're reviewing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The texts are all written by Chinese scholars so this class is actually a very cool way to gain a Chinese perspective on Chinese issues while practicing your Chinese. I think that, at this level, the gains simply won't be as dramatic as before, so don't expect that (though your Chinese should improve, especially formal reading and writing). But, that also means your peers have excellent Chinese which makes an interesting classroom environment where you realize you're actually using Chinese to do seminar-style discussions! Plus Prof Zhang is an excellent facilitator. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend to another student! I wanted to improve my political vocabulary in Chinese, as most of my experience with Chinese has been through conversations with family. With this class I was able to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish and was also really awed by the level of Chinese the other students had, which helped me improve. Zhang laoshi told us that this class probably was the class with the most advanced Chinese speakers at Yale (as opposed to Chinese 200). "
