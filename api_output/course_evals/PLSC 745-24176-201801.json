            "\u00a0provided an interesting overview of the new agendas and methodological approaches to the study of political violence ",
            "\u00a0Methodologically: I learned an enormous amount about how to incorporate different qualitative and statistical techniques to address difficult research questions related to numerous aspects of political violence. We learned lots about the gaps in existing research and how combining methodological approaches will provide superior means of addressing these topics.\r\n\r\nSubstantively: Despite my background in political violence, I still learned lots about different conflict dynamics/violence-related phenomena that remain understudied, inadequately theorized, and lacking in the collection empirical evidence. I generated lots of specific research questions that I plan to address in my own work in the future.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary: We learned lots about how other disciplines --- not just political science --- have studied political violence, and how we might be able to borrow techniques/frameworks in addressing our questions of interest. Reading the broad array of disciplinary treatments of political violence was a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nOverall, I also learned about how to develop a dissertation prospectus and broader research agenda, specifically through the final paper option (i.e. draft dissertation prospectus). I learned lots about what it takes to tightly knit together the different elements that ultimately comprise a dissertation. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a sense of the state of violence research. There were several weeks where our discussion made me think of a separate dissertation/paper idea from the one I already have. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The flexibility of the course was a benefit and a drawback. It was at times frustrating that only 1/3-1/4 of the readings were discussed during classtime, but it also allowed for really engaging conversations to emerge. Without advocating for mandated participation rates, I will say that it was frustrating that some members of the class would tweet passive aggressively about the discussion's tone, without contributing to the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interdisciplinary reading list, engaging/accessible professor, vibrant discussion, and enormously helpful final paper assignment allowing us to get a head start on the dissertation prospectus.\r\n\r\nWeakness: only weakness was that we sometimes didn't have enough time to discuss one or two readings each week, though that was mainly a product of the unfortunate 2-hour class time (Yale should allow 3-4 hours). ",
            "\u00a0We read a lot more than we ended up discussing in each class. Perhaps the reading list should be divided between required and recommended. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was grounding students in the most recent literature, and really getting into the contemporary debates. The weakness was focusing too much on research as it's developed in the last five years and not enough on a range of scholarship or a sustained focus on particular themes. While I got a sense of current research, I didn't get as much of a sense of the substance of political violence as I would have liked. I know there's a trade-off, but I think it might be helpful to either teach further iterations of this course focusing more on the substance/older research. Finally, there were too many readings and we couldn't get to all of them. I would highly recommend taking off some of the experimental readings that seem to be there so we can agree their identification strategy is terrible. It's a skill, but once you have it, reading more bad papers doesn't help. "

            "\u00a0Yes - Political violence is a critical area of study and I was thrilled that Yale's Political Science department was offering this course despite recent faculty departure. I would highly recommend that this course be offered regularly. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely--I loved this course, from both an academic and policy perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It was an indispensable opportunity to develop a research agenda, develop a list of questions/topics that I would like to address in future projects. Overall, it's a must-take for anyone hoping to address any aspect of conflict/political violence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For anyone who wants to study political violence, this gives a good overview of the field. "
