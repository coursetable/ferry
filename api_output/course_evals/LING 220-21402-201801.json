            "\u00a0I learned about English and non-English speech sounds, acoustics/how we actually make sounds/what sounds actually are, and gained a much better knowledge of non-English IPA. The course can get relatively math-y - which was interesting, but not expected. ",
            "\u00a0I finally learned IPA and have a strong understanding of how the vocal tract and all its articulators work in conjunction with one another to create speech. This was a great course in introductory phonetics that covers the basics of nearly the entire field. ",
            "\u00a0We learned IPA transcription, mechanics of speech production, and then a bit about acoustics at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely leaned about all thing phonetic. We reviewed IPA, learned how to use measure speech components PRAAT, studied all the possible sounds of human languages, did a research project on a language of our choice, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned non-English IPA and the physics and psychology of how sound is produced and perceived. I also learned to use Praat. "

            "\u00a0The course was very straightforward - weekly problem sets helped you learn the material, and the midterm exam was very reasonable. Workload was very light. Moreover, the TA was always very available to help - I don't think I could have made it through without him. For me, the most rewarding aspect of LING 220 was the final project, which allowed you to use the material learned to do hands-on research and work with a speaker of another language. Such was fascinating and very fun - I've never taken a class in which I truly collected and analyzed my own data in such a hands-on way. It was really amazing to see the concepts we had covered playing out in real life, right before my eyes. A weakness of the course would be that the lectures were quite dry, thus making it hard to pay attention. Honestly, with the exception of the final project, I regret taking this course - I do not feel I learned an incredible amount of interesting things, and the class was not engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course focused very strongly on the basics (eg learning IPA for the first half of the semester), which was good to get a solid base, but detrimental because we had to speed through the more complicated information later in the semester. That being said, there was ample time to meet with the TA and professor in order to clear up any questions that I had and they were both very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I personally thought more emphasis should be placed on fully learning the IPA not just in symbols but in practice. Some may consider it a strength that it surveys other issues related to phonetics such as audition and acoustical mechanics but I would have preferred that content to not have been there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that you do indeed learn. Weakness is that the second half of the course isn't very intuitive and some of the concepts aren't explained all that well. But just going to office hours or emailing the instructor or TA will fix that for you. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel that the content of the course was accurately represented in the outline. The course was much more physics- and math-oriented than I expected it to be. Had I known that there was to be a fair amount of concrete, not-entirely-linguistic content in this course, I may have reconsidered taking it. "

            "\u00a0I would not recommend LING 220 to another student. The class was not engaging, and I wasn't particularly fascinated by the material I learned. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course to take as a prospective linguistics major, but if you are not taking it for the major it probably isn't worth the time. You really do cover all the basics of phonetics and get a good idea of what to expect in future courses. The final project is a good exercise as well in writing about linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who wants to learn the IPA in a structured environment but there was a lot of stuff in the course that I as a non-phonetician did not care much about. I particularly did not care for the acoustic modeling part and the field work; however I wanted to learn phonetics in the context of better understanding how to pronounce modern languages and how to understand ancient language change. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend to anyone even slightly interested. But I wouldn't recommend this as your first course in Linguistics. even though no background knowledge was assumed this semester, most other kids have taken Intro to Ling or an equivalent before taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student -- I learned some vital things that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. However, overall the course was unengaging and slightly scattered due to the breadth of subject material covered in the course. "
