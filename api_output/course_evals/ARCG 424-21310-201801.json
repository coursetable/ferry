            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the role of Roman women and their portrayal in art ",
            "\u00a0Was helpful for an art history novice to learn more about Rome and Roman women from the perspective of art and architecture analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how various types of women lived within the context of ancient Rome, and I learned about some specific exceptional Roman women. I learned about how to read the intended meanings of Roman art and coins by incorporating both visual analysis and historical context. Along the way I also learned quite a lot about Roman history in general. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I expanded my existing knowledge of Roman women with respect to their lifestyles, the social status of various women, the impact of prominent women on Roman history, the Roman domestic sphere especially with respect to household art, representation of women in art and many other facets of the topic too numerous to list. Through this course I was able to hone my research skills especially when it comes to museum collections based research. "

            "\u00a0The course was discussion based and the readings were short and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been some basic prerequisite of Roman knowledge, be it Latin or CLCV, because it felt like we were playing catch-up for some students well into the second half of the course. I liked the format of watching short lecture videos before class and using time for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the topics selected and the two assignments were particular strengths of the course. I thought that class discussions were strongest when we had those small assignments where we were each assigned a topic or opinion to research and present to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers countless insights into the Roman world and the women who inhabited it. It draws from art, archaeological sites, primary literary sources, epigraphy and secondary scholarship. If there's one shortcoming for the course it's that there's simply too much material to cover. For example we were barely able to even touch on the impact of Christianization on Roman women. If possible I'd love to see a new course created focusing primarily on women in Late Antiquity, to follow up this course which mostly covered the Late Republic and Imperial Periods. "

            "\u00a0Solid class, the final project is a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. Whether or not you are particularly interested in women's issues, it is a cool way to learn about Roman history, art, and archaeology through a lens that does not just focus on the famous emperors. The two main assignments--read a Roman portrait and make an exhibition--were both really interesting and educational. Professor Kleiner is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in ancient Rome or to any student in women's/gender studies. "
