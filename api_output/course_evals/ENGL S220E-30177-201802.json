            "\u00a0A better critical eye for reading poetry, and a deep sense of respect for John Milton. ",
            "\u00a0Milton really forces you to read into every word and line break. Until this class, I don't think I ever truly had a full grasp on close reading. I am so much more confident after making my way through Paradise Lost and writing two sizable essays! ",
            "\u00a0History, writings, and beliefs of John Milton. ",
            "\u00a0Reading older and classical scripts and improved my writing ability ",
            "\u00a0I developed an appreciation for poetry, as well as Old-English literature. As someone whop has no taken English at Yale, Professor Rogers was an incredible introduction to this field of study and made me very interested in pursuing the field further. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to several major works of John Milton. After taking the course, I feel like I've experienced a strong general introduction to both Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes. This course also taught me a great deal about John Milton the man; I am curious to engage with Milton's biography in the future. Finally, this class provided me with the confidence necessary to read, discuss, and analyze some of the most complex verse in the tradition. I had a great time in this class and highly recommend it to any student, English major or otherwise. "

            "\u00a0Fantastic course all round. Wish there could have been more discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rogers and Professor Baricz are truly incredible teachers. You can tell they are very passionate about the area of study and often times bring in outside references from the literary canon that are extremely useful. Class discussions were always engaging. In terms of how this course could be improved, maybe we could have spent more class time on His Dark Materials? ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were highly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness would be improving technical issues with the Zoom software, as it prevented me from connecting several times. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. Professor Rogers is an excellent communicator and taught the class effortlessly, despite the technology barrier. The syllabus is carefully crafted and the readings are great! I will note: I'm not sure how necessary \"His Dark Materials\" is to this course. I would have preferred an extra day on Milton (perhaps we could have read Lycidas or covered Areopagitica?) instead of closing with the Pullman. Though the sci-fi was interesting, the reading assignment felt overwhelming with little payoff. Also, discussion sections felt slightly too short at only 60 minutes a piece. Apart from those two pieces of criticism, the class is very strong. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. I would highly recommend not taking the other 114/115 classes and going straight to this one. This class is infinitely interesting, especially if you have a general interest in philosophy and/or theology. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you go into the class thinking the material is dry, you will be shocked out of your mind. Milton throws you for every loop imaginable. With the help of John and Carla you begin to see what a mastermind Milton really was and how powerful language in general can be. Don't be intimidated! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor could make any course worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in English and John Milton, or topics related, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Being able to read and understand arguably the greatest work of English literature is an opportunity none should pass up. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an excellent course. Professor Rogers is an excellent teacher of Milton and really engages his students, regardless of academic background or major. Taking this class over the summer also allows you to dig into the material, though discussion sections can be a little bizarre. In summary: the class is fabulous and everyone should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. And do not be dissuaded by the fact that it's online. If anything, that ends up being a benefit. During the year, Professor Rogers teaches his Milton course as a lecture with sections, but over the summer he teaches it as a seminar, meaning you get way more direct interaction with him... which is fantastic because he is fantastic. Going in, I didn't expect much from an online class, but I can now honestly says it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YES! It was great - you'll come out passionate about Milton! "
