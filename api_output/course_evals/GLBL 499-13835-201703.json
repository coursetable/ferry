The team really bonded when we invested time to make the project great - that could have happened at the beginning of the semester if people knew ahead of time to block out certain meeting times outside of class. ",

Although in practice, it can feel like you are on a consulting team, you get the opportunity to do real work and \"make a difference\". Kristina Talbert-Slagle (KTS) is absolutely wonderful. I could not have higher praises. While she does push her students quite hard, she is caring, mindful of classroom dynamics, and wants to make sure everyone succeeds. Additionally she is incredibly knowledgable and only has great things to offer. ",
