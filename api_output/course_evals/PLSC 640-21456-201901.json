Readings, though advertised as posted on canvas, were often posted only a day or two before the meeting of the class, and the syllabus did not always adequately clarify what, exactly, the assigned reading was. Additionally, communication outside of class was at times difficult. That being said, these were minor inconveniences in an otherwise fantastic course. "
