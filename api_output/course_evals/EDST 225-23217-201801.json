            "\u00a0Learned how American society and the public sector aren't really prepared to tackle the US' childcare problem (there's no real formal baseline across the 50 states) and how important early childhood education is in decreasing poverty levels in the long run (research has shown it is more effective than college education in reducing poverty-related issues in the long run). ",
            "\u00a0This class was a wonderful introduction to the field of early child care policy. I learned about the many questions facing the field and had the opportunity to brainstorm potential future paths. The two professors made the course particularly valuable - they are so knowledgeable about every aspect of every topic we covered, and they shared their real-world experiences with us. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great survey of the issue of child care in the United States - the readings were well chosen, the class was extremely knowledgeable, and the professors were engaging, kind, and had strong backgrounds in the field. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most important classes that I took at Yale. Prof. Wagner and Prof. Sager have crafted a seemless syllabus that breaks down a complex system into a conversation of challenge and change. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in depth knowledge of the US childcare system from many perspectives (child development, workforce experience, parental stressors and considerations, center and home based options etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more comprehensive of issues surrounding child care in the U.S. and the ability to think about how these issues intersect with one another. I was also challenged to think of innovations that might improve the child care system through short activities at the end of class and the final paper prompt. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive understanding of child care in America and the difficulties facing the sector. I further developed my policy analysis and formulation skills. "

            "\u00a0Really interesting subject matter, the class is small enough that we have very close discussions every week, the professors are really knowledgeable and interested in sharing their wealth of experience with the class. Wouldn't change anything! ",
            "\u00a0This course had so many strengths! The two professors created an atmosphere of collaboration that made this one of the most productive seminars of which I have ever been a part. In addition, the daycare observation was an amazing way to engage with the material- and it was so much fun! ",
            "\u00a0I believe this class addresses incredibly important issues in the United States and Jessica and Janna cultivate an incredible environment. This class and its discussions begin to seem a bit repetitive after a couple of weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very enjoyable to attend and the discussions were interesting.  One thing I would change would be to have a few smaller assessments along the way rather than having the final paper make up a significant portion of the final grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely thorough but could benefit from more diverse angles of classroom discussion. I really enjoyed when the professors prompted us with activities to imagine solutions. The experience of visiting childcare centers was incredible and helped tie together a lot of aspects of the class. I wish we had spent more class time discussing or individual experiences. ",
            "\u00a0The readings of this class (especially the more personal New Yorker-type articles as opposed to the super long policy briefs, although I understand why they are necessary too) are a strength because they give us a broad array of things to discuss in class. I also really enjoy the student-led component of class in which student pairs create discussion questions for class and share them with everyone. I think that this could be improved, however, if all students were required to do this for every class. If each student posted their own discussion questions on the blog post and we discussed them in class, I think the discussion could be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was fantastic. Jessica and Janna do a wonderful job of picking interesting material and providing the class with opportunities to lead class discussions. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would! The readings are interesting and manageable, and we got to visit a local childcare center to experience what high quality care looks like. The experience of connecting our class to the real world was invaluable. Also the professors are super kind and care about their students so much (and brought us snacks every week). They truly value the classroom experience and have been some of the most amazing professors I have had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!! This was truly one of my favorite classes at Yale. The professors are absolutely incredible, the subject material is fascinating (and so important), and the assignments are all interesting approaches to the subject. I cant recommend it enough! ",
            "\u00a0This class would be a great first seminar for someone because the readings arent too challenging and Jessica and Janna are very supportive. Workload is incredibly managable. One drawback is that the in-class discussions start to feel very repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the topic! It's an important issue and the class gives you a comprehensive understanding of all of its nuances. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course to any student as child care is an important issue in America that college students rarely know a lot about, despite the fact that is has such a crucial role in society at large. The course relies on class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Janna and Jessica put so much thought and care into every aspect of this course from the syllabus to the snacks they bring to class each week. If there were one class I wish everyone at Yale were required to take, it would be this one. The topic is so important and the assignments are designed to give you a glimpse into the complicated world of early childhood education. The final paper is a chance to delve deeper into some aspect of the course and Janna and Jessica schedule check-ins which really helped me figure out a direction. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutelh recommend this course to another student. Both professors are extremely knowledgeable and provide great insights into the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Child care is an issue that I knew little about before taking this class, but after taking it I feel as though I have a much deeper understanding of how much of a problem it is in this country. I also feel as though Ed Studies classes like this attract such an engaging, passionate bunch of thinkers. Jessica and Janna are also great... ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend the class! Jessica and Janna are wonderful instructors, and the subject matter is so important. For anyone interested in education or policy (or both), it is definitely worth it. "
