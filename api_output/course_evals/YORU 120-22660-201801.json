The course is great since the professor works hard to make sure the material is learned well through repeated exposure. The TA is very helpful in and out of class to help students grasp the language better. The pace of the class can vary a lot week by week: at times it may feel like the class is moving slowly with not much work and at other times it can feel like the material is moving by quickly with a lot of homework.
