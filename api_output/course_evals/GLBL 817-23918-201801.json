            "\u00a0This course takes a deep dive into a new issue in US-China relations every week. You learn in-depth information about the problem and discussions revolve around understanding, analyzing, and even potentially addressing these issues. Great way to look at a comprehensive engagement so in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed insights related to different areas of concern in U.S.-China relations, from climate change, to human rights, to cyber and aerospace. While I've dabbled a bit in each of the subjects discussed in class every week, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into this areas, and discuss challenges and opportunities for cooperation with Professor Williams and my classmates. Furthermore, I developed skills related to legal analysis, and developed a greater appreciation for the role of law in each of these areas. ",
            "\u00a0While I had some previous knowledge of U.S. China relations, I developed a far more nuanced understanding of the subject through the class, especially in the legal context. Each week, we would study one specific topic that is incredibly relevant in the status quo, ranging from North Korea to cybersecurity. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: covers lots of material, but still very in-depth.  Amazing professor. Such a great practice in thinking about how law intersects with the world.\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't necessarily a weakness (and it wasn't an issue for me) but if you don't have any experience dealing with China before, you might be overwhelmed. Readings were heavy, I struggled to get through them weekly and felt that there's some room to condense them. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the way this course was taught as a seminar, with different case studies every week in terms of analyzing and understanding the progress and current situation of U.S.-China relations. It made every class seem more like a discussion, or a conversation among participants, rather than a formal instructor-student seminar. Furthermore, I appreciated how Professor Williams invited guest speakers into our seminars, and incorporated some of the China Center events into the class as a way of interacting and conversing with skilled practitioners in the field. In terms of weaknesses, I would suggest more continuity of themes or connections being more explicitly built throughout the course, and that we had more time to continue discussions beyond the time constraints of class. ",
            "\u00a0One particular strength of the class is its small size. We were all able to participate very thoroughly, especially with multiple debates throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Williams in amazing. An expert on anything China and such a great discussion leader. I would take a lecture taught by him if I could because he is so knowledgable. Great chance to broaden your understanding on a rising great power. Lots of reading but don't be shied away. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether they have extensive experience and knowledge of U.S.-China relations, or not. This course, while by no means an introductory course, is approachable from all levels of experience, and caters to a wide range of academic interest. The workload for the course is not terribly overwhelming--there is quite a bit of reading per week in the course, but it is manageable, and doing the readings will make for a far more productive seminar discussion. Seminars themselves are always dynamic, and Professor Williams will embed spontaneous debates, guest speakers, etc into the course to allow for a wider variety of discussion forums. I learned so much from this course, and really appreciated it! Would recommend wholeheartedly. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested at all in U.S. China relations. Previous experience/knowledge would be helpful but you do not have to be an expert in the subject at all coming into the class. "
