            "\u00a0In this course, I was exposed to a very technical type of philosophical literature of India written in the Sanskrit language. Here, I've learned how to read a complex Sanskrit text within this particular \"shastric\" tradition in which a classical text is commented upon and debated against an opposing interlocutor who objects to its interpretation. I've learned how to unpack the meaning of the debate, to see clearly the implicit rules that govern such a dialogue, and to understand the process of argumentation within it. Even though I've struggled with the advance Sanskrit language, I did enjoy very much the philosophy and the rationality displayed in the text. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are all related to the unique way of dealing with a Sanskrit text that Prof. Granoff facilitates. Her mastery of Indian languages is so incredible and deep that, during every reading, one feels fully immersed not only in the text itself but also in the culture and world-view that produced it. Perhaps, the weight and the emphasis placed on the philological aspect and the very reading of the text is so great that one may interpret this as a weakness, and even miss a little bit more of a contextual introduction to what surrounds the text.
