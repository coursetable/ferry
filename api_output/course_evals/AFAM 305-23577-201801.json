            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of/familiarity with the African American Autobiographical tradition ",
            "\u00a0- How to give more thought to the work of autobiographers, both Black and White\r\n- How to read more closely to understand someone's literary techniques ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a general survey of African American autobiographies ranging from slave narratives to more contemporary memoirs. With students reading a different memoir every week, the course allows not only for individual exploration into the themes and literary mechanisms at play within each work, but also for a greater consideration of trends and differences throughout the genre. Particular attention paid to themes of gender, colorism, the importance of language, ego, comedy, literary elements more broadly, the slave narrative as a point of departure, representations of blackness/whiteness, writing memory, and writing the self vs. the other. In other words, the scope of the class is broad. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading, writing, discussion of truth/non-fiction/facts, understanding and appreciation of narrating the self within black history and culture ",
            "\u00a0By the end of this class I am without a doubt a better writer, better close reader, more confident in my ability to participate in class discussion and more open to feedback and criticism of both my ideas and my written work. "

        [
            "\u00a0This was an INCREDIBLE class. Best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course didn't necessarily what it was doing, because it was an Af-Am course but kind of was an English/Literature course in practice, so I think it would have benefited from some more clearly defined goals. Since it was an Af-Am course, I think it would have benefited from additional contextual texts/discussion to ground the autobiographies in the larger African American experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Varied perspectives within class\r\n- Autobiographies were diverse across narratives\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- Final seems unnecessary ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus of this course was phenomenal!!!! Loved all of the books we read. Also the class discussion was great. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are in the weekly seminar meetings which centered around close readings of the texts and the texts themselves; it is a wide-ranging group of texts with regards to narrative style, themes, and content and this course provides the opportunity to explore these books. Some weaknesses have to do with the lack of connective work. Although the course is titled African American Autobiography, there is no substantial effort made at any point in the course to define what such a genre entails and whether or not the authors of the texts in questions are making deliberate efforts to engage with the genre. Furthermore, there are no non-African American autobiographies read, meaning that the actual, more broad genre of autobiography in which the authors themselves were engaging is not well established. Additionally, there is little context provided through the course itself; most background comes from student presentations which ranged in quality. ",
            "\u00a0This course has an amazing reading list and an amazing professor to facilitate honest, interesting discussions. Writing is something the professor takes really seriously, too, so if you put in the work, your writing can improve in this course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Mahurin (she is unbelievably amazing), the syllabus (also unbelievably amazing), the autobiographical final project, final class we ordered soul food from Sandra's and watched Chris Rock stand up. \r\nWeakness: honestly none. Take this class. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! You have to be ready to read a book every week and write promptless papers, but the books are so good that it really doesn't feel that burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! An amazing class with an amazing professor! The books are great, the class is great, and I am so happy to have had the chance to take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dean Mahurin is one of the best professors at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because Sarah Mahurin is amazing. But I think it needs some adjustments as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0yes, the reading list was amazing and Sarah Mahurin is an excellent seminar leader ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Sarah Mahurin is an awesome class discussion leader and her syllabuses are always amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would likely recommend this course to another student because there are few opportunities to engage in comparable seminar environments in which student participation is avid and well facilitated. That being said, the student should anticipate some questionable decisions regarding discussion themes/framing, assignments, and grading. Nevertheless, this course will shape the student's semester by inserting a reliable weekly opportunity to discuss wonderful & important texts in the company of equally as passionate students. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course! If you are interested in memoir/autobiography as a genre, you'll be delighted by the readings. If you are interested in how black people reclaim their own narratives (historically and in contemporary writing), you'll gain a great deal from the discussions. Plus, Dean Mahurin is wonderful. This class was always the highlight of my day!\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that I did not see as problems at all, but they might warrant a light warning for some. Dean Mahurin cold calls (sparingly, and forgivingly), and is said to grade papers just a little bit harder than average. Also, really do all of the reading! ",
            "\u00a0yes Yes YES. Take this class. Professor Mahurin will change your life. These books will change your life. "
