I am looking forward to being able to apply the skills learned in my future research and course work. \r\nStrengths:\r\n-Introduction of numerical tools and topics so that the foundation is laid for future exploration into topics\r\n-Speed and clarity of information presented\r\n-Quality of the homework assignments (they were great at giving an opportunity to really figure out how things work)\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n-The final project was a bit daunting. Maybe a few examples early on in the course of past work done would be helpful as people try to understand the amount of work expected of them. "
