            "\u00a0Great disposition.\r\nDid a good job at making all students feel comfortable with talking.\r\nGood feedback on papers. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was really great!  Though he clearly wasn't a specialist in the field or anything, he took our statements to their logical endpoints and challenged us to speak clearly and say what we really believed, even when that made us vulnerable for counterarguments.  I definitely learned more and felt like I was more self-critical in the sections than in the lectures.  Great job Alex! ",
            "\u00a0Alex was an excellent teaching fellow! He very much helped to facilitate discussion, guide and prompt us add needed, offer candor and presence. Alex was a mentor both pastorally and intellectually. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was one of my favourite Teaching Fellows that I have ever had. Our section was focused on the discussion document produced by one person each week, and there was never a shortage of things to talk about. Alex got interested in what we had to say, and helped to paraphrase when we had a hard time hearing each other. He would regularly, gently, push us back on track if we got off, and maintained a curious attitude himself, which made the room feel open. Especially after lectures which were often difficult, Alex made sure section functioned as a place for all voices to be valued. He pulled the best out of students. ",
            "\u00a0The sections were great! ",
            "\u00a0Alex was quite competent. But, the class was challenging. Many students did not engage in the discussion because of the material. Alex did well at engaging the students. ",
            "\u00a0Alex is one of the best discussion leaders I have ever had. He shares great wisdom that he has collected in his own studies, which always brings a great deal of nuance into arguments. He places every question within a much larger realm of ideas, all while reducing those ideas to bite sized pieces to fuel discussions. He also very kindly incorporates an orthodox Jewish perspective into our Christian context, and always urges the class to be precise and inclusive in discussion. Probably the most enjoyable section I've ever participated in. ",
            "\u00a0His willingness to challenge our representations was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Allowed a range of conversation during section. \r\nWeakness: Response time to student inquires was slow and made it hard to communicate. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was very kind and helpful, and I usually experienced his leadership and management of the class as a TF to be quite good. At times I wished he would have directed conversation a bit more. Sometimes the student presentations would engage a relatively minor text assigned for the week (often the shortest text...) and we would spend the entire time discussing a minor text while not engaging the central text of the week. I'm not sure this is really Alex's fault as much as it is a hole in the system of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Alex Ozar should never be allowed to serve as a teaching fellow at Yale University.  He never should have been.  He uses racist statements and is dismissive of anyone who does not look like him.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he was not responsive to communication or meeting requests. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was a postive presence in the classroom, and he effectively facilitated meaningful discussion, addressing students' comments directly and easily inviting further elaboration. There were times when I thought Alex could have made room for further discussion, or perhaps called on specific students, rather than taking it upon himself to summarize and present material. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is the most intelligent, competent, and respectful human being I think I have ever met. She literally made this class bearable. Jane came prepared to section, and handled all interactions with grace, gentleness, humility, and wisdom. \r\n\r\nJane should teach this class. ",
            "\u00a0Very knowledgable and caring. Wish she would have been the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Very helpful ",
            "\u00a0Jane is an excellent TF! Her demeanor is friendly and sincere, her knowledge of the material was comprehensive, and her asides in the section were valuable. She moved sections along efficiently, answered emails promptly and articulately, and provided extensive feedback on my papers. I felt that she really cared about my work. A very pleasant and knowledgeable TF. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is an excellent TF, one of the best I've had at YDS. She is clear, articulate and kind, and clearly is interested and engaged in the material and in our learning. ",
            "\u00a0Very knowledgeable and patient ",
            "\u00a0Jane is awesome! She is incredibly patient, and was willing to spend time in person and via email helping me with papers as well as just with general ethical questions. Whenever she responds via email, she is prompt and thorough in her feedback and advice which I really, really appreciated. Honestly, don't have much to say for how she could improve, she was a great help and an awesome presence. ",
            "\u00a0Jane was an excellent TF. Her comments in section were always elucidating. Section would have been improved by Jane taking more control over the structure of each meeting. I think the student presentations were consistently too long. I would really have liked to hear her speak more, because everything she said was so clear and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Struggled to talk about race and gender adequately. There were times I felt very angry about the way she handled these issues. Well organized and gave excellent feedback on papers. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is an excellent thinker, who is able to give reasonable answers to difficult issues. She facilitates discussions with joy for both sides of any argument and offers wonderful insights about papers that are rooted in clear explanations of expectations. She is very willing to meet with students and talk to them about their progress through the course or their understanding of difficult issues. Sometimes, she is hesitant to delve into the more difficult parts of arguments because she is interested in making sure that things are under control. ",
            "\u00a0Jane was a wonderful TF - she led us through section discussions admirably and I found that section was the only place I felt comfortable discussing material, asking questions and exploring ideas. Her feedback on my first paper was also excellent and gave me many good points to consider as I went further into the semester. She also gave us lots of room to discuss the events of the lecture class, and made safe space for us to process some of the hurt and confusion that resulted from Prof Eitel's remarks. I have no criticisms to offer of Jane, I found her accessible, smart, compassionate and warm. ",
            "\u00a0Jane was very helpful in discussion section as we sought to unpack big ideas int he course readings. She balanced student input with her own explanatory material well. She was patient and kind and thoughtful. ",
            "\u00a0Jane was excellent. She managed the conversation well. She recapped the material well. ",
            "\u00a0Jane has a nice manner and way of encouraging discussion.  Her comments on class and papers were really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Jane's work with my section group was outstanding.  She brought a lot of clarity to instances when the group could not easily make sense of the previous week's class content.  She also had a marvelous talent for synthesizing information around Ethical ideologies in a way that was understandable and practical.  It is hard to pinpoint areas for improvement for such a gifted teaching fellow.  Perhaps it would be worthwhile to spend extra time, during section, determining which areas of the curriculum (as taught in Class by Prof. Eitel)  the group saw as more challenging. The latter would be a welcomed strategy.  Overall Jane really provided my section group with didactic information we needed to make sense of some of the formal classroom lectures.  Jane is articulate, respectful and extremely smart.  We felt very encouraged having her as our TF. ",
            "\u00a0Jane was an absolutely wonderful Teaching Fellow. Her grasp of Christian Ethics is above and beyond. In section, she would clearly explain concepts that were confusing in class. Jane encouraged us to lean into uncomfortable topics and participate to the best of our abilities. Furthermore, Jane was easy to talk with outside of class and provided additional information for topics not covered in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Exceptionally well prepared, respectful, approachable, knowledgeable, clear and engaging, excellent facilitator. "
