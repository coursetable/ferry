            "\u00a0This was my first WGSS class, so I didn't know what to expect. We learned SO much, too much to put here, but some of the general themes were:\r\ngender identity, wage gap, militarism, title IX, transnationalism, citizenship, evidence-based problems with Yale Corporation (my favorite part), trans issues, sexual assault, and the list goes on. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who came into the course with what ended up seeming like more background information on the subject matter than most of the other people taking it, I felt like things stayed a little too surface level. The lectures were interesting and the things we read were engaging but I always wanted to push our discussions a little bit further. I think it was a great intro course and was probably way more useful for people who do not have a background in gender, queer, or ethnic studies. Nonetheless, I think I still gained a lot of knowledge of things like government processes and human rights discourse, and I still really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed the way I think about the relationship between institutions, power and  gender. Professor Grewal drew from a diverse array of readings to cover topics such as surveillance, transnational motherhood, feminist legal theory, the AIDS epidemic, the intersection of health and human rights, etc. After taking the course I feel as though I have a basic understanding of many important authors in the field of gender and sexuality studies. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to look at arguments and discussions in a more broad way that questions the author's intentions and goals. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insights about different strands of thought within feminism itself. The course is mostly about gaining insight and knowledge into the ways that gender is present and imposed in different areas of the nation and daily lives. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Inderpal Grewal is the coolest. Our TF, Salonee, was also so great. The class allowed for candid discussion, which was really helpful and healing as the Kavanaugh debates went on and issues on campus came up. The structure of the course allowed for me to get to know my classmates better, which I very much enjoyed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Basically a reverse classroom, which I didn't pick up on until after the midterm. We did the readings for class and then discussed them. The readings were interesting, but often dense and long. I'm glad I took the course because it challenged the slow reader in me, but the reading load was sometimes hard to manage due to its length and heavy topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - relevance of the class!!! Weakness - You get tricked into thinking the assignments are easy, but then realize that they are not. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was fantastic. The readings were interesting, Professor Grewal is a great lecturer, and the guest speakers were interesting. The only weakness was the midterm. We were asked to do way to much in 50 minutes, I believe it was 5 essays each 250 words minimum and we all came out of the exam feeling so stressed. While the grading was adjusted for this, we all would have preferred less work in such a short amount of time to better analyze and make connections in our essays. ",
            "\u00a0One really strong aspect about this course was the wide range of topics related to gender justice that Professor Grewal covered in a relatively short period of time. I also loved the diverse range of readings that we had - ranging from New Yorker pieces, scholarly articles, a legal rights NGO's legal analysis of a case involving transgender access to bathrooms in schools, etc. The guest lectures were also incredible. Simone Browne talked about security theater at the airport, Gregg Gonsalves talked about the AIDS epidemic, Celene Reynolds discussed her article on Title IX and sexual harassment... One weakness was sometimes Professor Grewal's lecture slides seemed to pose more theoretical questions rather than concepts that were easy to grasp, so I often was confused about what concepts exactly I could have taken away from lecture. The class was overall very engaging and amazing though. Professor Grewal is one of my favorite professors I've had so far. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: passionate instructors, engaging readings. \r\nWeaknesses: things got a bit repetitive at some point and in my opinion analysis didn't go as deep as I had hoped. This is a great intro class, but if you already have a basic grasp of things like intersectional feminism and queer theory it's going to feel a bit surface-level. I wanted harder questions to be asked, and by hard I don't mean in terms of intellectual difficulty, I mean like the sort of thing that makes you question your worldview. ",
            "\u00a0I particularly enjoyed professor Grewal's teaching style, her choice of readings, and the way she used time in section. Towards the second half of the semester she began incorporating more interactive activities into her lectures, such as asking us to participate in discussions or write down questions/comments that she would thoughtfully respond to one by one. I enjoyed these activities and wish they could have started earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was able to include an array of topics under gender, sexuality, rights, and race that didn't seem confined onto one particular group. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was very helpful and interesting. The readings themselves, save for maybe four total, were NOT filler or tangential readings, but rather very compelling and thought provoking readings. Guest lecturers and the TA's lectures were great too! Assignments are fair and enjoyable. I do think the midterm was unfairly rushed and that the final was nothing like the midterm, leaving me feeling like it made little use of the copious concepts and readings I had gained a good footing on. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this class to people interested in WGSS. Prof Grewal really knows what she's talking about and I feel well versed in feminist literature now, something I couldn't say before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was a great survey course of structural violence related to gender. Professor Grewal is great and does a really good job of making the class engaging even though it is a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. This class is so relevant and everyone needs to take a WGSS class like this. Everyone. Its so rare (unfortunately) that classes at Yale really dissect current events and I can't tell you how much I appreciated unpacking the Kavanaugh hearings with my professor and my classmates that week in class. Professor Grewal was always willing to stop class to discuss something important that was going in class or in the country and more professors need to do the same. Also, the assignments (like analyzing a political ad) were not too hard and just as relevant as our class and section discussions. We need more classes like this!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The readings and topics were super interesting and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0EVERYONE should take this course. This class was personally fulfilling, intellectually challenging, engaging, and the readings were incredible. If you are considering taking the class, just look at the syllabus and that alone should convince you. The course covered Title IX and college campuses, Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment, the AIDS epidemic, labor rights, anarchists such as Emma Goldman... the list goes on. On top of that, Professor Grewal made the course overall very enjoyable. She was an accessible professor, always checked in to see how we were doing, and always made sure that what we were learning in the class was translated to the outside world. We talked about activism in gender justice, gender justice in the media and current events, and took the class during an incredibly relevant and timely moment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony on her experience with sexual assault during Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. I will always remember how grateful I was to have this course as an intellectually and emotionally supportive space during that time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's not too heavy in terms of workload and deals with interesting and relevant material. You'll get the most out of it if you've never studied gender or race before. If you're someone who's well versed in third world studies and stuff, things might feel like they're not deep enough. Also, it probably deals with the military and corporations way more than you would expect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if this is a student who has only been exposed to material that left them thinking \"feminism is just about equality with men\" "
