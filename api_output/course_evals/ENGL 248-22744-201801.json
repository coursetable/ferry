            "\u00a0This course was FANTASTIC. My knowledge of storytelling, structure, and good writing took several leaps forward over the course of this semester. My understanding of what composes a good story improved greatly. I learned how to develop excellent characters, and play on stereotypes to create something new and interesting. I started this course with only a vague idea of television storytelling structure, and left with the ability to critically analyze shows for their rhythm, pace, and structure as well as how to write my own. I cannot even begin to express the ways in which my knowledge of this area expanded and grew over the course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0At its most fundamental level, this course taught me the basic structure of storytelling. I left feeling like I had a clear understanding of what makes for a compelling story. To oversimplify, a good story is one in which the character wants something, encounters obstacles to fulfill his wants, and ultimately either achieves it or not. But more concretely, this course taught me how to put together a TV pilot and an accompanying series document. I decided to write a full pilot even though the course only required two acts because I felt ready to see the project through. I am very happy that I did. For those interested in pursuing a career in television writingor any kind of job in the entertainment industrythis course provided a great opportunity to put together a fully realized portfolio. And although it was not class on the \"business\" or how to pitch your show in Hollywood, a strong writing sample goes a long way for any such professional aspirations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop an idea for a television pilot into a full-length pilot script by following a development schedule akin to how professional television writers create their own scripts. I wrote a script I am ultimately very proud of and hope to pitch/use as a strong writing example of mine as I enter the professional industry. ",
            "\u00a0Through the class, and its emphasis on character, I got to meet the characters I dreamt up. Professor Green opened the class with a discussion of character, and that through a want, and an underlying need, characters can produce the endless drama necessary to sustain the longest forms of storytelling. Through this course, I learned that from these characters can spawn entire worlds, dictated by their wants and needs and not the other way around. After weeks of brainstorming on the characters alone, a world sprang up to contain their stories. \r\n\r\nAn essential part of this course was the workshop aspect. By studying prestige, and not-so-prestige, drama, we learned how to read scripts beyond personal preference and genre and analyze the great aspects of any show. This taught us how to read each others work, and in turn, how to make each others projects better. Walking away from this course with a complete series document and pilot, though a seemingly far-fetched goal at the beginning of the semester, feels natural. Through formulaic development techniques and constant feedback, the actual writing of my 58 page script came easily. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much! Professor Greens presentations on character and structure were concise yet absolutely eye opening. Close readings of scripts helped us to get a hang of both scenes and acts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop and write a television pilot! But more than that, I learned so much about the fundamental elements of good storytelling. By far one of the most valuable classes I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course -- great intro to the process of storytelling and developing characters. Professor Green gives the class very useful tips for creating drama and teaches you many of the ways people make good TV. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about storytelling, especially long-form storytelling. Unlike any other creative writing class I've taken at Yale, ENGL 248 had a really strong focus on crafting a story people are actually going to want to engage with--it was very outward facing, and more concerned with the reader/viewer than the writer (which I think is a hugely important perspective to have). I learned about writing conflict, creating tension, crafting interesting characters, and writing good dialogue. ",
            "\u00a0Basics of storytelling in an intuitive and elemental manner. Building characters in a way that creates inherent conflict. Turning an idea into a fully-formed series. The conventions of network/cable drama. These simple but incredibly difficult processes are broken down and made possible for anyone willing to do the work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Its strength is in the camaraderie, teaching style, and exceptional organization that made it so we were consistently working to develop a single idea. The opportunity to work on one idea and engage fully with it nearly every day for a full semester was absolutely unparalleled. The workload is such that you are constantly engaged with course material but not overwhelmed to a point that it becomes unpleasant. I can't think of any weaknesses right now  this course was well organized, brilliantly taught, and an awesome chance to really work on my writing and storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0This course had many strengths. The first was the individual meetings that Professor Green held with students virtually every other week. Receiving feedback one-on-one really allows students to improve their writing at an exponential pace. The second strength was the course material. The carefully curated list of scripts ran the gamut of possible styles in dramatic writing from Scandal to Deadwood. Any student could find a script that spoke to them and from which they could draw inspiration. The third strength was the workshop format that Professor Green lead the second half of the term. After putting together a couple acts of their pilot to share, students had the opportunity to receive comments from other students. It felt like being in a professional writers' room, as the caliber of the writers there was truly remarkable. I can't really think of any weaknesses for this course. I wouldn't change anything about it. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths definitely lie in its structure, which avoided the pitfall of typical creative writing classes (go write a story, and present it to the class for workshop), and instead kept everybody on the same development schedule. By having the class spend weeks developing our characters and their voices before even writing an outline, I was able to see my idea through to fruition, which I thought was an ultimately successful script. It was only after writing our outlines/scripts that we started to go into workshop, which I also appreciated, as it allowed me to focus on the quality of my individual project, without worrying about having my work be constantly under scrutiny of workshop. Instead, my workshop, and the workshop of my peers, felt like a truly collaborative workshop space, where we were offering comments to sincerely help improve each others' scripts, rather than prove that we were smarter/better writers.\r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of the course was the syllabus. While the scripts we read were mostly excellent, there was only one female-authored pilot on the syllabus, whereas the other scripts were entirely authored by men, and focused primarily on male protagonists. The scripts were helpful tools to teach the craft, but I feel as if the lessons being taught about voice, structure, etc. were skewed by the syllabus's insistent focus that only \"Breaking Bad\" or \"True Detective\" were scripts that successfully pulled those maneuvers off. I would have loved more diversity in the writers featured on the syllabus, so that we could learn that not just a show like \"True Detective\" operates so expertly around a framing device. For a class that so champions this Golden Age of Television, it feels as if the syllabus should reflect the ways in which otherwise marginalized or previously silenced voices are finally having a moment to have their stories told through TV. ",
            "\u00a0Professor does a really great job of breaking down story elements and translating these essential skills to the particular medium of the Television Drama. The subject matter was endlessly fascinating, and the class environment was very positive. I looked forward to class every day. One improvement could be a more cohesive lecture format within the seminar, to give more structure to the focus of a particular class. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, really cares about his students and does an amazing job running the class ",
            "\u00a0Difficult to really find anything wrong with the course! Its one of the best learning experiences Ive ever been fortunate enough to have. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of a weakness for this course except that I wish it were longer. Student engagement and participation was perfectly balanced with direct instruction. And the material was just fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course is very strong and Professor Green is great. Strengths are definitely Professor Green and all his tips for creating dramatic stories with interesting characters. He also is always willing to meet with you even considering his really busy schedule, which is awesome. The one weakness I can think of is honestly Professor Green's handwriting -- it is basically illegible and you must schedule an appointment just to get him to read his comments. If we could submit things in PDF form and he commented online, this would all be solved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: all of the writing assignments were in some way creative, which was great. I also appreciated that we built up to writing an actual script with lots of smaller assignments, which became the building blocks of the script and made writing this intimidating long-form piece a lot less scary. Discussions were always lively, workshops were helpful, and all the other students had really interesting things to say.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't always get a lot out of the discussions about existing pilot scripts. I tended to just skim the scripts, and I think it might've been helpful if we were assigned to watch the pilots as well (to help us understand how each script actually works on screen). "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. For anyone with an interest in storytelling  even if it isn't television writing particularly  I would highly recommend this course. The knowledge gained and portfolio developed can not be over-emphasized. It is an absolutely worthwhile  and fun!  class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, take this course. It was hands-down my favorite class at Yale. Professor Green is fantastic and he'll take the time to meet with you one-on-one several times during the semester. By the end of the class, you'll have a couple fully realized acts of a pilot (or a full pilot if you so chose) that you can take with you wherever you go. Great for anybody thinking of pursuing screenwriting or writing for television as a career. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you are serious about writing for television, this class will give you both a schedule to adhere to as well as a final, tangible product at the end of the course. Professor Green will really take the time to develop your project/writing with you, so if you're able to get into the class, take advantage of it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you're interested in going into television or just love to watch. This course is very accessible. It's a lot of writing, and the course's pacing seems intimidating at first, but it is quite manageable, as is the reading schedule. This was the highlight of my semester, and potentially my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, one of the best classes Ive taken ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have a passion for long form television drama, you absolutely must take this class. Professor Green will really help you develop not only as a screenwriter, but more generally as a storyteller across different mediums. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this class enough. It's a lot of work; you will right well over 100 pages for this class, but trust me, if you want to write, it's worth it. And it doesn't have to be TV; the things Professor Green teaches you are applicable to any form of narrative fiction. But if you really do want to write for television, TAKE THIS COURSE. You'll make great friends, learn a lot, and walk away with an entire one-hour pilot episode and series document, ready to submit to studios. It's really invaluable and a whole lot of fun! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you can -- it is amazingly fun (while challenging) and Professor Green is awesome. He really teaches you how to craft interesting characters and how to create drama. The readings are fun and Professor Green is always willing to meet while you work on crafting your pilot. I cannot recommend it enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are willing to put in a lot of thinking/writing and really care about making good television, THIS IS THE *EXPLETIVE* COURSE. "
