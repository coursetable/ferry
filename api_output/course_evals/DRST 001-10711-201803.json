            "\u00a0Close reading, attention to detail in text, metatextual analysis, theme and archetypal comparison between books, allegorical references ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills through the three papers I wrote and thorough feedback, learned how to better dig into the texts we were reading through Socratic-style teaching, and certainly developed the ability to read a lot faster. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to close read a text (e.g., the extreme attention to detail in noticing that the two saevus's in the famous statesman simile of Aeneid I may actually have been intentionally placed to create a subtle rebuke of tyranny), how to connect ideas across texts (e.g., the Phaeacians in Odyssey and the Phoenicians in Aeneid), and how to read a story within a story. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me become a much better writer. I improved my close reading skills and learned to narrow my focus when choosing a topic. Although I had read some of the texts before, the experience of reading them all together provided me with a wealth of references and connections I am so grateful to now have. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting introductory course to western classics. I developed skills in literary analysis and critical thinking, and I think the close reading papers are particularly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0writing style, reading efficiency, critical thinking, ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. My writing improved greatly from the beginning of the semester to the end, and my writing speed increased immensely. I learned how to read both critically and quickly. Professor Quint showed us how to look for the small details, the oddities of each text, and think about how they might change the way we read the book. And I have a much greater understanding of each of the books we focused on throughout the year. DS: Lit was a wonderful introduction to books necessary to read if you think about reading any Western literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned primarily how to perform a close reading of a text and how to write a proper academic paper. I also learned to deepen my appreciation for the rich texts we studied in class. ",
            "\u00a0A variety of Greek, Roman, and early Italian Renaissance works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the themes and tropes that characterize the Western literary canon from its inception to the 1300s. I also gained a lot of close-reading and essay-writing skills. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: quick pace, range of book types covered, world scholars in the field\r\nWeaknesses: quick pace, superficiality in dealing with each book bc. of time, paper style and content almost entirely depends on the literary likings of the professor rather than student-centric (ie. I must write a certain way, avoid certain words bc. teacher preference, write about certain topics, avoid certain themes, etc) ",
            "\u00a0Some texts we spend a very long time on, while others we rush through and do not nearly dig enough into. ",
            "\u00a0Although the amount of reading for the course was significant, I always enjoyed it so much that it didnt seem that way. I loved writing essaysthe topics were excellent and left room for choiceand class discussions left me thinking long after. At times, we would get very deep into the material and then not have time to pursue the topic at hand as much as I would have liked. But perhaps that always happens. This was my favorite course of the semester, and inspired me to be an English or literature major going forward. ",
            "\u00a0The course does an excellent survey of western literature. However, its difficult to obtain an in-depth understanding of each individual work. ",
            "\u00a0no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a) you read an incredibly large amount of books in a small amount of time. This allows you to cover themes of these books and also to read books that you will probably read in other courses anyway. b) you have access to amazing teachers. My professor, David Quint, went to Mantua halfway through the year. When he came back, we asked why. He had gone to Mantua to receive the Virgil Award. I don't think I'll ever have a professor like Professor Quint again. He is so knowledgeable about every text we read and opened them up literarily for me. c) you are surrounded by an incredible amount of nerds just like you who speak your language. Some of the greatest community and some of my greatest friends I've found at Yale is through DS. d) you write an essay a week; that's hard. Yet you learn to deal with a really fast pace. DS demystified 5-page essays for me, and they aren't as hard to write as they were. My writing has improved a lot, and my writing speed has multiplied. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a) the pace is so fast that a lot of the books we cover might not get their fair due. We spent two classes on the Old Testament and two classes on the New Testament, for instance; yet the Bible is one of the founding works of Western literature as well as an incredibly fascinating and important book to read. The teachers understand that the pace is not always ideal, and if you want a class that might cover some of the material more in depth, then you might not be looking for DS. That said, DS is only your first year: if you want to go more in depth with one or multiple of the works, take another class in them. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course; the only way it could be improved would be that at some points I had difficulty hearing the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The only major weakness I found was the fact that we often moved too quickly from text to text. However, I fear this is inevitable in D.S. since there are so many texts to cover. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the nature of the program, a lot of the great moments and contents of the books don't get to be discussed. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class, in conjunction with other DS classes, is an excellent route to take if you are at all interested in the humanities, writing, history, or law. I learned to read quickly, catch major concepts, and reflect on subtle textual clues which at first seem ordinary. The class itself is amazing. Your experience truly depends on the professor you're assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if they wanted to cover a great amount of text in a short amount of time to build a better foundation for their reading skills and textual analysis. If they would rather spend more time with single texts, and had less of a desire to compare a larger tradition, I would not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would. The class has been the best part of DS so far. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take Directed Studies Literature with Professor Quint if you can. This course improved my writing and analysis skills immensely, but most importantly Professor Quint made me fall in love with the texts we read. His passion and energy made me so excited to come to class. Professor Quint is very dedicated to instilling a love for literature in his students. His class was by far the best literature class I have ever taken in my life. ",
            "\u00a0Yea, I really enjoyed my experience in DS Literature class. ",
            "\u00a0yes, especially those interested in literature or directed studies, in general ",
            "\u00a0Most wholeheartedly. This program is wonderful, one in which you read a lot of books in a really short time. If you really like books or writing, I would strongly recommend applying for DS. A great community, access to wonderful professors, amazing lectures, cool seminars in which you will be blown away by just how smart your classmates are, and fun all around. If you don't mind spending your Thursday nights in the library with other DSers finishing and editing your essay (it's more fun than it sounds, though). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Quint is extremely wise and eloquent, and seems to me to be one of the best DS Literature professors in the Fall term. He does Homer, Virgil, and Dante particularly well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone interested in literary history, specifically in the West, on the condition of them being VERY interested in the subject matter. D.S. is certainly not suited for someone only moderately interested in the subject matter. "
