I was able to listen to these intervals and identify them by ear. I learned theory behind chord changes especially major chord changes in popular music transferring between tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. I was able to practice sight reading and analyze theory with written sheet music. I also improved on my sight singing abilities. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths on the course include the professor. He was very willing to answer questions and was thorough in this response. He also showed examples on the board and was able to illustrate some examples on the piano. I enjoyed the keyboard lab as an addition to my coursework in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are its accessibility and its ability to build off of existing skills easily. I say build off of because in areas where I was lacking the basic knowledges, I felt myself quickly falling behind and unable to catch up. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student who wants to improve their musicianship skills. It is not a difficult course, but the more work you put in the more you will get out of it. There aren't a lot of strict homework assignments, so it is really up to you to practice in order to improve your skills. ",
