            "\u00a0I learned several laboratory skills for genetics experiments, as well as how to perform calculations on data from lab in order to draw conclusions. I also improved my ability to reason through experiments. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I found that Dr. Dawson was a lot of fun and he created a relaxed learning environment that I felt was really effective. I also thought that the experiments themselves were interesting and that I truly learned new skills and concepts that would be useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the lab report guidelines didn't always match up with the grading rubrics. I often felt like I did everything asked for in the guidelines and then somehow there was always something else that I lost points for that was on the rubric (which we are not given) but not in the guidelines. ",
            "\u00a0The labs are interesting, and I liked that we used multiple model organisms and got to see the different procedures for working with them. Professor Dawson was helpful as well. I would have liked if the quizzes were more regular in timing - maybe right at the end of each model organism unit. ",
            "\u00a0Had a hard time reaching out and getting help from both the instructor and TA. Little resources for help. Also, our last three quizzes (which are worth a hefty portion of our grade) were rushed and given to us at the end of the semester back to back. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great broad overview of various laboratory practices that will be useful for future lab research. Also the professor is kind enough to prepare a lot of the tasks before hand which was helpful so that we were focused on the material not the time-consuming tasks. Lab report guidelines were extremely helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student in MCDB because the course is manageable and the professor is always willing to help. I have been exposed to various labs before which I found helpful, but even for the students who hadn't taken a lab, there is a time spent making sure that everyone is on the same page. ",
