            "\u00a0I learned so much about what autism is, the science behind it, how it affects families, and social policy concerns. I had a very sketchy idea of what this disorder was before, mostly based on movies like Rain Man and random comments from uninformed people, and this course answered so many questions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about clinical diagnostic assessment ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the intricacies of autism and the science behind it. I've also now decided this should be my line of work. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great breadth of knowledge regarding autism spectrum disorder. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding the history of autism, how it has been defined and changed throughout the last 50+ years, how diagnostic criteria differ from coutnry to country, how mental health services are provided and how their availability has changed over the last 50 years, novel findings in genetics and neuroimaging that ground autism research in more scientific concepts, and improvements in interventions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the difficulties in diagnosing and treating ASD. Through the course, I was exposed to the complicated nature of the disorder and of the various social and cultural aspects impacting it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about autism that I did not know before. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into autism and psychological evaluation ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the definition of autism and related ongoing debates. Also discussed evidence based treatments and their efficacy. "

            "\u00a0The course is amazing given that we had such a short period of time. I was worried about not being able to volunteer and see kids with autism, but the professor offers the option to volunteer during the semester and makes sure to show videos of kids with autism and Asperger's, which I really enjoyed. I also loved all the guest lectures, especially the one with John Miller. ",
            "\u00a0There will be weaknesses with any online course, such as technology that does not work. Strengths include information presented in a clear, concise way. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the knowledgeable professor who presents the material in an interesting way that engages the students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the Professor and teaching fellow who were both easily accessible, the discussion sections which were highly informative and interactive, and the course materials which were engaging and easy to understand. One weakness was the emphasis on the material from the first half - I think we could have spent a little less time on this and more time on concepts from the second half. In addition, I think that having comments on our reading responses could have highlighted which concepts the Professor/teaching fellow thought we had down and those which they thought we could spend more time studying. ",
            "\u00a0Very informative, but as an introductory course, broad in nature. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the content and it was incredibly interesting. The only thing was that even after the whole course, I still feel like I don't understand what the available treatment options are. I think it would have been helpful to look at some case studies and see what exactly their treatment plans were, or how their education was altered for best possible outcome. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--good discussion, weaknesses--some material was repeated ",
            "\u00a0Great topic, Professor Volkmar is extremely knowledgeable and highly regarded in the field. Could be improved with more concise lectures, some of the information was a bit repetitive. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! The professor is amazing and so knowledgable and the structure of the course is really well done. The workload isn't bad at all but you will learn so much. There will definitely be some topics that you will be genuinely interested in and want to learn about, and you can easily find additional sources or ask Prof. Volkmar for resources to explore those interests more fully . ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to learn about a social learning disorder with an interesting history and a heavily politicized/sensationalized presentation in the media. It clears out a lot of the bs that you've inherently picked up on and makes clear that we know a lot more about it that most people think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ASD is a fascinating disorder and one that is receiving more attention today. The course also delves into the cultural and social aspects of the disorder, something that I feel is sometimes ignored in the search for medical diagnoses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this course and Professor Volkmar is very knowledgeable and kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was very useful ",
            "\u00a0Yes, allows you to really delve into the topic of autism, even without any prior knowledge or personal experience. Provides scientific and clinical context for a really prevalent mental disability. "
