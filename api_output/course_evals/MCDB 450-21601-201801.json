            "\u00a0I loved the Human Genome. I learned so much about reading scientific literature and the current state of genetics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and digest scientific papers, which is a skill set I will certainly need as I enter the medical field. ",
            "\u00a0It really helped me to understand how to read scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to really analyze a scientific paper. I still have a ways to go, but I feel like this course gave me a lot of tools to read really cutting edge research and for that Im very grateful. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to really critically analyze big genomic papers ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I was able to develop my critical analysis skills because each week we were given scientific papers to read and analyze. While there was infinite opportunity for assistance in deciphering the papers, the main focus was on the preparation of the student. I feel like I'll be able to read any scientific paper from this point on. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! You learn so much about genomics and current technologies through this course. Definitely worth it! ",
            "\u00a0More than anything this course has taught me how yo critically read and understand cutting edge research papers and to truly understand the intricacies of complex topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to work through difficult scientific papers and deconstruct its figures, even if I was unfamiliar with the terminology or technology discussed in the paper. I also learned how to work with others to understand a paper and present it to the class. ",
            "\u00a0A great course for reviewing up-to-date research literature on human genetics, with a wide variety of topics. "

            "\u00a0The discussion environment is incredible for learning this kind of material. I loved the breadth of topics that were covered, and the detail that was covered in terms of discussing each paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths are that it is very structured. We read 1 or 2 papers a week, have no other assignments, we know we are going to work in small groups and then present the figures and its a good size class so you each get a chance to participate everytime. I think a weakness is that sometimes the papers are too dense and I wish we had more guidance of finding where to learn the definitions to some of the jargon. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dellaporta is so kind and willing to help everyone understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think that having one person lead discussion each week would be really rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I really appreciated that we worked in small groups to talk about the figures because this increased the amount of class participation and also increased the relationships within the classroom between students. ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing, I wouldn't change a thing! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Because we were not tested on the papers, it encouraged me to read the paper and focus on understanding it for myself, rather than for an exam. Having the class discussion afterwards was useful for clarifying confusing parts of the paper or expanding on the interesting parts. Working as a group during class was also helpful because we helped each other fill in missing pieces. Having the class be student-centered, but having the professor step in when necessary, was also great for learning. ",

            "\u00a0Yeah I certainly would recommend it. I learned a lot and its low workload so you when you do do that work you feel immersed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would. Its a great, low-workload upper level MCDB elective that also forces you to think, improve and learn. What classes should be! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. So far, this has easily been my favorite class at Yale. I feel like the background material that I learned in MCDB202-Genetics came full circle and was helpful when seeing the real world application. Also, there are multiple speakers throughout the course that provide their unique insight and applications to their jobs which was nice to see the different ways that genetics can be applied beyond the scope of a classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Every MCDB major who needs an upper level elective should take this. You learn a lot about a field that is really important in the bio world, and its in a super chill setting. Professor Dellaporta is really good at letting us lead discussion, while also being very encouraging and helpful even if we get things wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about a career in science, it truly was an amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Dr. Dellaporta is awesome and the papers discussed were always very interesting. I learned a lot about the current state of research in genomics and came out better equipped to read papers in this field and scientific papers in general. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. The papers were interesting to read and although they were sometimes difficult to work through, there was plenty of help in class. The workload is also very manageable - about 2 papers to read per week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have the background and want to learn more about human genetics, this course is for you. "
