            "\u00a0Assigning two books per seminar is the only point of weakness in this course. With this workload I found that I could never cover as much ground with each book as I normally can in courses where one is assigned each week. This might be a matter of preference, but assigning one book per week allows for deeper close reading. "

            "\u00a0If they specialize in Ottoman and/or Middle Eastern History I would definitely recommend this course to another student. However, given the concentrated scope and volume of the readings, I would not do so if another graduate student were a non-specialist. "
