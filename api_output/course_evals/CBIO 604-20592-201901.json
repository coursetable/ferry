            "\u00a0It was great to get an overview of all systems in the body. Histology could be integrated into a few of the lectures. Some homework assignments could have involved more critical thinking and less textbook knowledge. In person histology slides or samples would have made the histology labs more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The online laboratory portion is very informative- I would actually prefer to have more images for each module and increased labeling within each image to better understand the image as a whole. \r\nQuizzes and assignments were very fair in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThe lecture portion of this class is not very cohesive. Engagement with lecture material is somewhat low because some lectures have overlapping content, which is a product of having so many independent lecturers. The fact that lectures are never tested on also hinders willingness to engage with lecture material. ",
