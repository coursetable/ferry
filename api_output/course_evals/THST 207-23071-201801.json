            "\u00a0I really didn't understand how much dramaturgy and dramaturgical tasks were ones that I really enjoyed. This class spoke to the liberal arts aspect of theatre and really helped me to apply dramaturgical thinking to all aspects of my theatre making. ",
            "\u00a0To be honest, I'm not entirely sure.  I don't know if I've developed skills and if I have I can't name them.  Categorizing and naming the different skills we're meant to take away from the class would be a boon here. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive and practical introduction to the rich field of dramaturgy; a thorough understanding of what a dramaturg does and how dramaturgy is essential for the theatre. ",
            "\u00a0So much! I look at theater in a completely different way thanks to this class. I learned a ton both about what dramaturgy is and how I can apply dramaturgical thinking to my own work in the theater. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about the mindset of a dramaturg, giving productive criticism, and doing script analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to prepare a dramaturgy casebook for a theater production, and how to analyze plays from a dramaturgical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I truly learned what dramaturgy, which is a complex topic within itself. I gain several skills for dramaturgy and how to read plays. I also learned about different theories involved in theatre and read several plays. I also was able to work like a dramaturg for assignments. "

            "\u00a0Have a second semester of this course! ",
            "\u00a0The class certainly is fun with a plethora of different kinds of activities.  The opening several lessons to the class, however, were confused insofar as it wasn't clear why we were doing what we were doing.  I could be something as simple as a five-point syllabus:  \"Dramaturgs: 1. Analyze Plot 2. Analyze Structure 3. Research History 4. Critique 5. Give Talkbacks,\" or what have you.  That way when we were deconstructing the Greek structure, we understood what our intention was to be, the end goal.  Also, expectations for the final project/presentation were very confusing.  Also, more feedback should be given sooner in the course.  Many courses at Yale wait until midterm for any grade report and this is a mistake. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was a very strong course, and it did a great job of covering all the different components of dramaturgy. I have especially enjoyed working on a single casebook over the course of the semester, as well as having the chance to revise it for final submission. One weakness, in my view, is that the syllabus felt a bit too packed at times: there were quite a few secondary readings that we could not discuss adequately in class due to time limitations. In the future iterations of this course, it might be a good idea to reconsider the readings assigned in addition to the plays. Another minor weakness is that there could have been clearer guidelines for the final presentation; it seemed as though everyone had a different idea of what those presentations were supposed to be doing. Besides these, this was a great course and should definitely be taught again! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the setup of the course! The steady stream of assignments was the perfect amount of work. I loved being able to work on a play of my choosing throughout the semester; it was an excellent way of applying the skills we learned about in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! Perhaps a twice-a-week format would have been better for the types of activities we did, though. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class!! The syllabus is really well crafted, and Lynda is a brilliant teacher. The only thing I wish is that the class could meet twice a week with the reading distributed over the week. ",
            "\u00a0It was the first time the course was taught, so the schedule sometimes shifted. A major strength is Professor Lynda Paul and her boundless enthusiasm for the subject and her students. ",
            "\u00a0If I could find any weakness in this course it would be at times it felt rush. However, the course was able not adress several topics such as translated works, editing play texts, and different types of dramaturgs.  The course was well structured, so that each week we focused on one topic with an example play or two and artcles on the topic. The class also involved hands on activities. "

            "\u00a0The student would have to be an aspiring dramaturg or interested in devising/writing new work.  Some classes have a wider appeal in that I could recommend a niche AMST or AFAM course to a wide audience, but this course isn't one of those.  I don't think that's something against the course, just the subject matter.  If the student were a THST major, I'm not sure how my answer would change. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Dramaturgy is a fascinating field, and Dr. Paul is the perfect person to walk you through it. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES!!!! Honestly I think this course should be required for every theater studies major. My only regret is that I couldn't take it sooner in my theater studies career because it's so applicable to all aspects of the major. If you're not a theater person but you want to take a class in the department, this is the one to take. The skills are so applicable to all kinds of thinking, plus it's such a joy to spend time with Lynda every week! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. DO IT. If youre a director, designer, actor, or a reader of plays, this class will give you invaluable perspective on your work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lynda is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes i would recommend this class to anyone. It was both a pleasure and educational experience. I felt like a gained a much deep understanding of not just theatre but also how humanities can connect. "
