            "\u00a0This course required me to engage in a ton of unlearning and relearning: I realized a lot of the history I'd been taught was incomplete/inaccurate, and it was difficult but really powerful and rewarding to learn the histories that I never learned or never learned properly/fully.

            "\u00a0I learned, first of all, how lacking my middle and high school history classes had been in their portrayal of slavery, settler colonialism, and international post-colonial relations. So much of what I thought I understood about race, class, and oppression goes far deeper than the sort of surface level perspective I had. This class transforms our perception of injustice as a list of wrongs into one of injustice as a systematic, intersectional, insidious, ongoing process, and provided me with frameworks for thinking through current issues and my own work in a wide range of areas. I also learned what ethnic studies means. ",

            "\u00a0This course provided a vast, interdisciplinary, and enlightening survey of histories of racialized populaces worldwide, detailing the structures of dominance  that have subjugated them and the diverse modes of resistance they have employed. Through our studies of these peoples, we challenged myths of origin and of innocence, learned about worldwide trends of imperialism, decolonization, and migrancy, analyzed the intersections of race with class, gender, sexual orientation, and religion, considered questions of liberalism, citizenship, and membership, and understood resistance in activism, integration, and remembrance. ",

            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction into the history and creation of race narratives as means of distinction and power. I was provided with an academically solid understanding of emotionally difficult subjects, and the way I see the structures of power around me are changed and deepened. ",

            "\u00a0Not only have I become a much better writer, but I have been able to become a much better critical thinker about the world around me, and about the way the world is being manufactured to be presented around me. As a first year POC minority student, this class was my first exposure towards any sort of comprehensive insight into racial studies. I have been able to become aware of my own history, and so much of that can be applied towards my future and career in creating a better world for myself and those around me. Thank you so much for this course and its presentation. ",

In particular, I learned about parts of history which I hadn't before and how they shaped our modern conceptions of race, space, etc., as well as reinforcing and broadening my understanding of topics which I had learned about before without as much depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class was like an overview of the history of racial oppression/subjugation. It addressed the stories of peoples all around the world and gave students the opportunity to view their histories from their lenses. It offered me a new perspective from which to view different populations of people, and opened my eyes to the extent of pain that indigenous groups have suffered. It also made me feel for the injustices of the past and allowed me to carry this outlook to analyze the injustices of the present. The trajectory of the course allowed me to make connections between different events and see the lasting effects of the phenomena we discussed at the beginning of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Some of the readings were not really about race or ethnicity or migration. These readings were the works of some guest speakers; however, the guest speakers' works were not always related to any of those fields and shouldn't have been included in the syllabus. That being said, most of the readings and the discussion section were interesting, but the lectures were very average. I think that with more organization, this course could be really amazing, but it felt a bit thrown together. A lot of big topics were just given a cursory glance, and were not as engaging as they could have been. ",
            "\u00a0It was an great course and I think the guest lectures added a lot to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings and interesting topics. loved the global playlist assignment. \r\n\r\nWeakness: she is a super boring lecturer which made the class really unengaging for me. Somewhat chronologically organized but it could be better. ",
            "\u00a0Section was fantastic. I loved hearing other people's thoughts in a small group setting, and I found it genuinely interesting to attend. \r\n\r\nHowever, the lectures could be much improved. They were relatively monotone and hard to stay engaged in. They also had a structure that was very difficult to follow, and I often couldn't tell where we were topic-wise even with the outline on our handouts. It seemed like lectures always opened with an intro, but the intros were lengthy and I couldn't always tell when I should really start taking notes. The material is fascinating and Prof. Camacho is a great scholar, but more engaging and well-structured lectures could greatly improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0more visual lectures ",
            "\u00a0The content was wonderful, engaging, and important. The guest lectures were great. The assignments were very reasonable. Lecture could be hard to follow, but I do love Dr. Camacho! ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a range of historical topics that are often excluded from mainstream narratives and lectures were always brilliant. It could be improved by either going in more chronological order or providing a bit more structure to the general trajectory of the course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the guest lecturers were amazing! The course gave a good \"intro\" to the ERM major, and gave me a good idea of whose courses I would like to take. It was awesome to read work written by professors at Yale.\r\nweaknesses: there wasn't really a flow from week to week; it seemed like we were jumping from topic to topic. However that is understandable as it is a broad Intro course. \r\nI also thought my section was much too small in size, and therefore lacking in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are useful and engaging, and were the part of my homework I most looked forward to. Professor Schmidt Camacho is unspeakably brilliant and unafraid to challenge academia, Yale, or the government in the context of the histories we were learning in class. There were so many little things that contributed to making the class enjoyable and not painful, like having all the readings available on Canvas or Orbis, being treated as students with a lot to contribute to intellectual discussions, both from our academic backgrounds and person experiences. The only weakness I can think of was that Professor Schmidt Camacho's lectures were so beautifully composed and almost poetic, it was hard to take notes or know exactly what info we should try to retain. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schmidt-Camacho is a gem who truly cares about her students. In her lectures, you can tell how knowledgeable she is about the concepts she is discussing. However, for that very reason, lectures were often inaccessible and difficult to understand. The readings were so large that you had to skim them based on time alone, but if you came in to the class without having done the readings it was difficult to follow the lecture. She also used very little visual aid, so if you're a visual learner like me and not an auditory learner, it may be hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- Camacho and her TA's were all incredibly warm and encouraging. They really care about their students, and we got to see some wonderful lectures, both by Camacho and by the many other Yale professors she invites to give guest presentations. Weaknesses -- Assignments didn't always follow the syllabus (or, when they did, match exactly to what lectures ended up covering), and adjustments to readings were often made last-minute. The grading distribution is also pretty odd -- there was a 2-page paper essentially worth the same as our midterm and final exam, and we only received one grade all semester (though the grading on that was very generous, and the TA's stress productive engagement with the texts over graded evaluations). ",
            "\u00a0Clearer connections between lectures. More structure in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It provides a good idea of what the ER&M major is supposed to do and provides a good idea of how the major is applicable in analyzing historical moments\r\nWeakness: because it is required to major in ER&M, it is the basic level of analysis and depth that one can engage in ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! The lectures were extremely helpful, but the sections helped, even more, clarify the material as it was a lot of dense material to go through! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Camacho, the TA's, readings were challenging but interesting, great foundational course.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures can be dull, the midterm was challenging due to the amount of material asked us to cover in a short essay ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the broad range of topics - both in terms of time period and geographic region - that Professor Camacho covered in a relatively short period of time. I also really enjoyed the readings. They were all wonderful. A weakness is sometimes I felt like terms or concepts were not defined, so I sometimes felt like I was not able to fully engage with the material. That being said, this is an introductory course, so I would need to take more ER&M courses. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: provides a broad overview of various topics and issues relating to ethnicity, race, and migration; guest lectures were incredibly engaging and interesting and provided a different perspective on issues\r\nweaknesses: lectures moved kind of slowly and were hard to follow, lecture slides were not well organized and were sometimes even distracting; overall the course presented us with a lot of information but most of it only touched the surface of the issues and did not go in depth into the intricacies and nuances of certain things, broad but not so comprehensive ",
            "\u00a0The readings were almost universally fascinating. I especially enjoyed the guest lectures, which exposed us to different fields and expertises. No weaknesses come to mind! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a very chill introductory course! The assignments and exams were comprehensive, but never overly burdensome. The lectures were a great mix of different topics and I loved the guest lectures. ",
            "\u00a0All of the information presented is so interesting but it also is a lot to digest in what feels like a very short timeframe. I think if we had more time during discussion sections to talk about the topics it would make the course more digestible. ",
            "\u00a0Schmidt Camacho is incredibly knowledgeable of the subject, but at times can be a little hard to follow or keep attention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Guest lectures, Prof. Camacho's interest in getting to know her students, Prof. Camacho's knowledge and interest in the given material. Weakness: A few of the lectures by Prof. Camacho were a bit broad which made it hard to focus on the subject and somewhat easy to stop paying attention in class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course; I learned a lot from the lectures and from the readings. I don't have any particular advice for how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: everything about Alicia Camacho, the most empathetic, hard working, and dedicated professor on campus\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I wish there was some powerpoint presentation of sorts or visual cue identifying the topic being discussed along with the lecture, as it was hard to keep up at times or know what the topic being presented at the moment was. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Camacho is amazing at explaining concepts and the guest lectures were also very great to facilitate our learning! ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been more organized in the second half of the semester. The first semester was great because although we moved between histories of Indigenous peoples in America and black Americans, the lectures were cohesive and one could see clear intersections between what we learned. In the second half, although we learned about a wide multitude of different topics, many of them were guest lectures, so it was hard to find a common theme between each topic. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is too broad and we should focus on a few topics and readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered perhaps too much terrain over the semester. The course was loosely structured chronologically, though it also jumped from topic to topic. It was sometimes hard to draw a through line from class to class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the topics we covered incredibly interesting, and I liked that lectures usually covered broad themes as well as some specific examples and/or key players. I also liked that we engaged with some different kinds of media and got to hear from different scholars about their work. I also enjoyed section with Daniella, which I think she facilitated well. One thing which I found difficult was that while Professor Schmidt Camacho's lectures were very interesting, there was very little on the lecture slides, and she went at a fairly rapid pace, so you had to keep up with what she said and it was very difficult to know how to take notes and differentiate between minor points and main themes. ",
            "\u00a0the main weakness is that there is just so so much covered in the course that I never really felt as though I understood or fully grasped a concept that was being taught and if I did then it was only briefly as we would then move onto a different topic rather quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is taught in chronological order, and you are given opportunities to make connections between different topics discussed in the course. The course readings were varied and interesting, and they were often accounts from scholars who were introduced in lecture. The readings help make the abstract concepts more concrete. There is great variety in material covered but there are common themes that run throughout the course. Apart from learning about big concepts, you will definitely learn some cool tidbits of information from time to time. I feel like we studied groups that I had never learned about before or had very little exposure to as well as groups that are always covered in history class. This class will expand your perspective, and that is more important than any facts or dates you memorize. Discussion groups are a nice way to explore specific topics that were brought up in lecture as well as make personal connections to the material. I feel like the course material has weight -- I mean that it is relevant and important information that everyone should know. You are learning about concepts that had impacts on real people's lives and that is often brushed over or minimized when we learn about history from a textbook. The assessments in this class are fair and you shouldn't stress about them.\r\nWeaknesses: The reading load is considerable, so if you have multiple classes with a high reading load, it may be a struggle to get all of the reading done. The class deals with abstract concepts. Level of engagement depends on the topics that are covered each week. You might find one week incredibly boring, and another week you might be super passionate about the material. "

            "\u00a0It won't be the worst class you've ever taken, but it's just not as engaging as it could be. I would recommend taking another ER&M class that goes into greater detail of something that you're interested in, but if you're interested in the major, you have to take this. It's okay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The workload is pretty small and the course material is interesting and engaging. The other students who take the course are also great, so section was always engaging. I especially loved the end part of the semester when we had guest lecturers who talked about their areas and expertise and introduced us to other classes we could take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think the topic matter in this class is really important, however, I felt really disengaged in lecture so it really wasn't worth it for me. Walking up to Luce every day just really disincentivized me from going to class because I knew I would fall asleep anyway. Attendance is mandatory so take the class with a friend to get through that together. This is not a gut and has lots of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. If you're willing to sit through somewhat boring lectures but learn some important and interesting stuff, take it. Make sure to be engaged in section meetings if you do. ",
            "\u00a0This class was kind of a mess, but Professor Camacho is so kind. I went into this class expecting that we would be reading foundational ER&M texts but that was not the case at all. Some of the readings were super niche. I feel like this is the one ER&M class Im going to take in my life and I got almost nothing out of it which is really sad. As a visual learner, I had a really hard time paying attention in class because Professor Camacho used slides very ineffectively. Her slides were generally pictures of irrelevant artwork or, on the other extreme, WAY too much text  were talking paragraphs here! It was nice that the class had such a low workload but I didnt come out having learned a lot. For the most part this class is just people throwing around buzzwords like the imaginary or neoliberalism without all being grounded in the same definitions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Lectures were sometimes hard to engage with or follow, but readings were fascinating, discussion was fascinating, and the content was wonderful. I appreciate Dr. Camacho and feel lucky to have had her. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a must-take for people of any major, as the knowledge you'll gain is important to have regardless of what field you'll actually be going into. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course for anyone who isn't a prospective ERM major. I think their time would be better spent choosing a particular subject and diving into it on a deeper level, rather than covering such a broad array of topics in a short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone at Yale should be required to take this class. I've struggled a lot to articulate why it's so important and paradigm-shifting to learn the material presented here, but I feel so strongly that a lot of our political discussions inside and outside the classroom would be radically different if everyone was working from the same understanding of histories of injustice and systems of racialized oppression that we learned in ER&M 200. It's also a great introduction to the ER&M major or the courses offered in general, because of the many guest lectures in the end of the semester, every one of which I left feeling excited to search whatever that particular faculty member was teaching next semester. It was a life-changing course, particularly for a often-discontented science student. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an ER&M major, you have to take this course. If you aren't, this is a good intro class only if you are not knowledgeable about the topics. If you know the basics on several ERM topics or took APUSH in high school, a lot of this course will feel like review and it will not be intellectually challenging. However, the readings are interesting and the class is not hard. As a base course, it's not bad. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as they keep in mind that this class is a survey and is taught through a historical lens. It is not a sociology class, and it is not going to dive into any one group too thoroughly. However, if you take this class for what it is, it was a very enjoyable, laid-back experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you are even 10% positive that you will be come an ER&M major, take this class as a first-year or sophomore. Taking this class as a junior or senior will not allow you to appreciate what the class offers ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should take this course before leaving Yale. It covers a really broad survey of material from across history, and it really changes the way you think about the world. This course is a must. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class truly helps students learn a complete history of the United States and explains the longstanding oppression against minorities that has and still exists until now. TAKE THE CLASS, PROFESSOR CAMACHO IS AMAZING! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a history buff, this course made me re-evaluate everything I had learned about history. I believe every student should take this course to gain a solid understanding of race and other related topics and how it is shaping the world around us.  This class, although it is rumored as a \"gut\" definitely isn't as it forces you to think in ways that you haven't before. It makes you answer difficult but necessary questions. Please take this class! Also the TA's are amazing and Alicia truly cares for all of her students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, and I think that every student should be familiar with these concepts. The course covered so many interesting and important topics - imperialism, slavery, postcolonial theory, migrant rights, etc. However, I would not say that this course would be enjoyed by or is accessible to every student. A lot of people who take this course bring in outside knowledge, which can be intimidating for someone who is unfamiliar with the material. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is often unclear what concepts we should take away from lecture. Overall, I would say this was an interesting and worthwhile course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in learning about ER&M. However, it provides a very broad overview of issues and fails to go into depth into a lot of things so you might be left with more questions than answers. But this might spark an interest in taking more ER&M courses which is important. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ER&M 200 packs an incredible amount of vital knowledge into one semester and left me with countless questions about both myself and society. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Schmidt-Camacho is AMAZING!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The topics coveree in this course are important and I recommend that everyone take a course like this during their college years. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is not that difficult and it forces you think about issues that are often neglected in traditional education. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! There is a very light workload which allows you to actually focus on the material, making it a very worthwhile class. You also learn so much history about different ethnic, religious, and racial groups. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, it was an incredibly interesting course on topics that all Yale students should explore at some point in their Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you have not engaged much with the themes of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly. Alicia Camacho is one of the most brilliant people I've had the honor of meeting, and this course should be required for every Yale student to ensure they become compassionate and aware individuals in today's divided world. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course! Regardless ignore you are interested in ER&M as a major, this course is amazing and teaches you so much! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you've never taken an ER&M course before, the material that you learn frames history in a completely new and much-needed perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As someone who knew very little about the topics covered, I was blown away by the sheer scope of history that is deemphasized and forgotten in the world. This class sheds a new light on current and past events. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course teaches a lot of material that is integral to understanding the impact of race, ethnicity, and migration in the world, which is not often acknowledged fully in courses relating to history or the politics of the present. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good intro class and Prof. Camacho is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I think every Yale student should take at least one ER&M course and why not take it with Prof. Camacho. Taking ER&M was perhaps one of the best academic decisions I made in my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. We engaged with a lot of interesting concepts and materials in this course. The guest lectures were also a very helpful component that showed me some other opportunities in the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration department. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I think it's important that everyone understands the racial, ethnic, and migratory processes which have shaped the world and which shape how we interact with the world. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely than an interesting class and I would recommend it. The work is not too challenging but the topics brought up will definitely challenge notions you had before or maybe things that you were taught in high school.  I learned so much about different groups of people and it helped me realize how little I knew about certain populations. I think everyone should have an understanding of the histories of different ethnicities and racial groups, and this course is a perfect one for that. "
