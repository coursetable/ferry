I walk away not only with knowledge about the material, but also an idea of the history and conversation about the topic. There was a lot in the course, so I sometimes felt overwhelmed. The readings on canvas and the classes didnt match up so I was a bit unsure about what I was supposed to read when. But the readings were helpful, and the class was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Super useful and interesting course! I learned a lot of things that I think will be useful and I'd like to learn more about. I'm very happy that the lecture on  BEUTi and BEAST (and related programs) was recorded. It made some things much more doable than they would otherwise have been.  \r\n\r\nThe learning curve for the various programs was a bit uneven and it took some time to get things working. Sections were very helpful. "
