            "\u00a0reading, writing, speaking, and understanding Chinese -- also learned about Chinese culture as a byproduct of studying the language ",

            "\u00a0Chinese 142 is a substantial jump in difficulty from Chinese 132, but the course remains excellent. Techniques developed include memorization and a lot of it, but the amount of class engagement makes memorizing all the characters worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what study habits are most effective for myself. I learned a wealth of knowledge in the Chinese language and now can confidently speak with my parents in my native language. I gained insight in how to interpret Chinese characters for not only what they represent, but also why they represent those things. ",
            "\u00a0Memorized hundreds of characters; reading and writing and grammar skills developed; vocab greatly expanded ",
            "\u00a0Continuing from 132, I further learned how to speak, listen, read, and write about social issues, politics, and aspects of Chinese culture. 142 was definitely more rigorous, than 132, and I had to learn to more quickly grasp the greater volume of increasingly difficult grammar structure and vocabulary. From the in class presentations, I got more comfortable with my presentation skills, both in general and in Chinese. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the professors really get to know you and help you improve your language skills through a personal level. They know each and every one of their students flaws and fixes them accordingly which in my opinion, really helped improve my Chinese skills ",
            "\u00a0strengths: encourages you to partake in the Chinese language daily\r\nweaknesses: may have stressed memorizing characters a bit too much, rather than having plentiful relaxed discussions ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more discussion based classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helps you learn Chinese through daily quizzes, but I often feel like it does come down to brute force memorization. Of course, this is due to the nature of the language and I'm not sure how much they could do to change that, but be warned, there is a lot of character memorization. Despite this, the teachers are very interactive and try their best to make the class interesting for the students, which is greatly appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely structured and effective in teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Great course for retaining and learning Chinese characters, as well as student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0The class is excellent, just like every other Chinese class at Yale. One will probably come close to freaking out after realizing that theres still a seemingly endless amount of Chinese homework to be done every day, but its worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this class is the consistency in what you expect from the daily class, so that you know precisely how much time is required for work.\r\n\r\nThere are not many weaknesses that I can think of; this is an extremely effective and useful class for teaching a language. ",
            "\u00a0I think we spend too little time on grammar. I wish we could also spend in-class time constructing essays/sentences as a class (more holistic approach). ",
            "\u00a0Great teachers who really know what they're doing; There's daily homework, but it definitely helps you learn to use the vocab and grammar structures rather than just being able to recognize them. Answer keys with suggested responses for the homework practice problems would be great for studying for exams. I think the course could also be improved by letting us have more opportunities to practice speaking outside of class and not just for the presentation days -  perhaps doing recordings like the higher level Chinese classes would help.

            "\u00a0Yes definitely. The class is rigorous but by the time you finish, you will see a drastic improvement in your language skills ",

            "\u00a0Liu Laoshi is an amazing professor. Definitely take esp. for your language requirement. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Would highly recommend. Liu laoshi and Chan laoshi are super sweet and do everything to help you learn and understand better. ",

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend because of Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi! They are amazing kind caring professors who really want you to improve your Chinese but also care about you as a student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%! Liu Laoshi is an amazing teacher and human being, and I love coming to class because it's essentially a very chill discussion. If you're looking to take a Chinese class for language requirement or just to learn Chinese, I'd highly recommend this class. The workload is significantly greater than CHNS 132, but I also learned a lot more from this class and found that I could adapt to the greater amount of vocab and grammar that we had to learn each week.
