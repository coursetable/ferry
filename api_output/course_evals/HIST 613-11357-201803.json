            "\u00a0I improved my ability to read various handwritings including Round, Italic, and Secretary hand as well as various forms of abbreviations. I also learned more about how paper and ink was made and books were bound. I also gained insight into the literature on early modern England book history including work by leading scholars on topics including reading and graffiti. The course also made me very confident in my ability to locate and use materials in Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0How to engage with archival sources for sustained research and interest; how to read Early Modern hands and situate them in time (helps evaluate the age of a given manuscript). ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the different manuscript hands; information about how paper, ink, and different bindings were brought about; introduction to the Beinecke archives; and information about early modern scribal culture ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more detailed knowledge of early modern handwriting, especially the secretary hand useful for my own research. I also benefited from reading secondary literature and becoming more familiar with the Beinecke collections in my own field. "

            "\u00a0What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?\r\nThe course certainly fulfilled the aims set out in the syllabus and Kathryn was a wonderful, patient instructor whose enthusiasm for the course and materials was obvious. My research paper was a lot of work, but really forced me to engage with the material extremely deeply and Kathryn made herself extremely available all throughout the process. \r\nOn the whole, the course was great. The only thing I would improve would be the assignment for each student to lead a weeks class. The criteria for what the student leading the discussion was supposed to do was not clear and most of the time, the student did not end up leading the class. In general, the material is not particularly conducive to this type of assignment, so I am not sure if it is worth keeping this assignment going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: kind instructor, flexibility to pursue our own interests for research papers, support for learning how to read different hands, access to a wide array of texts\r\nWeaknesses: occasional lack of engagement in seminar (especially with other students' presentations) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Informative introduction to course content. Professor James constantly gave encouragement to explore new avenues and was helpful in providing resources to begin research \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: presentation requirements were not always clear ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in its use of the Beinecke materials and exposure to early modern handwriting. I believe it could be improved with even more exercises in transcription, and more assignments that deal directly with early modern scripts in addition to the secondary literature. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is hoping to explicitly improve their paleography skills. Although book history is covered, it is very much a course about handwriting in early modern England and so if this is not exactly what you want to learn, then I would not recommend it. That being said, I do not study English or early modern England and I still really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if he/she would like to engage in archival research long-term. Also, the Beinecke resources are so extensive...you don't want to miss an opportunity to work with them! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This course was a great introduction to the Beinecke archives and offered a great introduction to manuscript culture ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend the class to someone in my field, especially to work with Kathryn James and the Beinecke collections. "
