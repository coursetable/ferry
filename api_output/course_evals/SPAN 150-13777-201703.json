            "\u00a0I thought this course was really helpful for practicing speaking in Spanish, and Profe Valle gives a lot of feedback in correcting our grammar and sentence structure both in our writing and our speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my spanish quite a bit and learned about many current events issues. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to speak and write in Spanish significantly improved from taking this course.  My speaking is much more fluid now, and my writing is even more grammatically precise. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Spanish grammar, communication skills, and critical thinking in this L5 Spanish class. The focus was on refining our speaking and writing abilities, so weekly assignments included discussion forum posts and oral recordings, in addition to readings. I gained insight into how I could improve my pronunciation and vocabulary to make my communication in spanish more effective. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the emphasis on speaking in this course. In particular, I wanted to maintain my speaking ability, but I found that the majority of L5 courses in Spanish prioritized the written component. While I did have the chance to write and to do so in a variety of different styles, most of class time was devoted to group or partner discussions. Each week, we also had to complete an oral in which we talked about that week's topic for five minutes or so in a relaxed manner. The orals in particular gave me the opportunity to go in-depth with a certain topic and gain confidence speaking for long-periods of time. Because of that, I feel that I could now engage in a debate, address a topic in-depth, or even give a speech in Spanish. Professor Valle also gives substantial feedback for each assignment. Thanks to her feedback, I have finally corrected grammar and pronunciation mistakes that I had been making for years. ",
            "\u00a0My spoken Spanish improved greatly, and I got a good refresher in vocab and some grammar that we covered. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: workload is reasonable, expectations/syllabus are very clear, professor is helpful and wants everyone to succeed, discussion topics are generally interesting\r\nWeaknesses: grammar practice not always thorough/at times repetitive ",
            "\u00a0I feel like there could be more practice on the spoken component -- I still do feel a bit lacking in speaking ability (at least not native level yet) ",
            "\u00a0I think the oral component of the course could be made further enriching and rigorous, but the writing parts were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent because it allowed me to engage in so many aspects of the Spanish language.  There were a mixture of reading, writing and speaking assignments that were all great practice, and the class discussions were always fascinating.  The novel was also very interesting and well-suited to the level of the class.  The only aspect of the class that could be improved is the focus on grammar.  It would have helped to have had a little more practice with some of the challenging grammatical concepts.  The workload was pretty heavy already, though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the constant detailed feedback on all written and oral assignments. Also, readings are often assigned every class, which allows you to practice reading and critically analyzing Spanish literature both during and outside of class. The weakness of this course is that sometimes there were many assignments due on a single day, which made it very difficult to thoroughly read the assigned texts and complete all the work accompanying the reading. My advice would be to always start the homework the same day it is assigned, though I never did this. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well-structured. Professor Valle frequently uses Canvas to send out assignment reminders, submit oral recordings, and post responses on the discussion forum. I could often anticipate my workload for the week and then organize my assignments accordingly, so I never felt too overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the course material. Often, I forgot I was in a Spanish language class, but felt that I was in a Spanish literature class. The seminar-style classes really emphasized discussion, and, with Professor Valle's encouragement, every person ended up contributing. The discussions and projects were also very entertaining. We had multiple debates, class dialogues, and role-playing. I frequently looked forward to completing the weekly readings, especially when we read Crnica de una muerte anunciada. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would change would be the partner format. Often, we would discuss a topic with a group and then take five minutes to discuss it in pairs. I think it might be helpful to have a consistent partner with a similar ability so that both people contribute equally. ",
            "\u00a0There could have been more emphasis on grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a very great course to improve Spanish overall, including spoken Spanish which many other Yale Spanish L5 courses neglect. I wish there was even more focus on speaking and especially on casual, conversational Spanish! "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it's a good fit for people coming out of high school having placed into L5 from the AP exam. The topics and instruction style are very similar to the way they are handled in the AP course, so the transition is not as difficult. In general, I think this course is a good practice for communicating in Spanish at a higher level. ",
            "\u00a0The class and professor were super engaging, and I feel like my Spanish got a lot better. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to strong L5 speakers who want to improve their spanish as much as one could in a classroom section. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it significantly helped me to improve my Spanish.  The class discussions were excellent because we discussed real world issues while improving our Spanish as well.  There was a lot of work, but it was reasonable and very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend this L5 Spanish course to anyone who has placed into L5 or has completed L4. I learned much more than I thought I would in one semester. The readings were sometimes quite challenging, but working through them before and during class truly solidified my love for Spanish literature. Furthermore, the weekly oral assignments made me constantly work towards better spoken pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great bridge between L4 (Span 140) and the other L5's offered that are 200+ level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed class and even the weekly readings. Professor Valle, in particular, is very encouraging and structures discussions so that all students participate. I especially wanted to work on my speaking ability, and I feel like I accomplished that with this course. Overall, a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Highly highly recommended, especially with Profa. Valle! It's not a whole lot of work (obviously there are assignments for every class meeting, but they're not extremely challenging). Your Spanish does improve a lot if you put in the effort, and it's a very fun, low key class overall. "
