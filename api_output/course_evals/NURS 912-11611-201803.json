            "\u00a0This was a very good introductory nursing doctoral course.  I came away from the course with a basic understanding of nursing theory, conceptual frameworks as the underpinnings for research, and philosophy of nursing science.  It was a great foundational course.  This course taught me to think more critically about my own research objectives and thoughtfully consider conceptual problems I want to address as a doctoral student in my own research.\r\n\r\nI also learned (quickly) how to put together presentations on my material.  Feedback provided for the presentations was very helpful as we are at the outset of our doctoral work. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I developed skills regarding scientific writing and knowledge about philosophical backgrounds. In particular, this course was helpful to improve skills to synthesize literature in my specific field of interest. ",
            "\u00a0How theories are developed and tested. How they are used to generate questions. The different philosophical approaches used in science. I gained insight into my own way of thinking and worldview. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the formal methods of synthesizing data and previously existing research, the basics of theory development, and the broader context in which research questions are developed. I also learned the basic philosophical underpinnings of scientific inquiry, and how the mental work of scholarship--discovery and data analysis--are connected. "

            "\u00a0This course was a good introductory class on theory and philosophy of nursing.  There was quite a bit packed into a short semester with philosophy and theory put together in the course.  The biggest challenge was coming to the course with some expectation for our beginning area of research to give a foundation to apply what we were learning, but there is no way around that.   I appreciated that the philosophy papers required us not just to spit back what we learned from reading but encouraged us to apply to our area of interest.  That was very helpful for thinking about our conceptual problem.  I definitely learned how to think more critically about my area of research and how to begin to synthesize new ideas.  The course objectives felt very lofty at the beginning, but by the end of the semester it seemed to be coming together.  The end of semester paper felt like a big accomplishment. \r\n\r\nIt was both challenging and a great opportunity to have two professors teaching the course.  The philosophy portion felt very separate (almost like a different class).  Feedback from the professors came from very different perspectives, which is clearly a tremendous  learning opportunity as we begin our doctoral work, but it was also challenging as a first year student to meet expectations for both when they seemed at times markedly different.  Overall, it was a great course, and I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The classes were structured to bring active discussion among instructors and students. The discussions were thought-provoking. \r\n\r\nWeakness: As each student has different research interests, it would be helpful to organize the course to address general research procedure rather than discussing each research topic during the class. While it is still fascinating to know what other students are interested in, it felt a little repetitive as the same discussion continues over several weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the use of mini lectures to set the tone or groundwork for discussion would have been helpful when discussing the theoretical portions of the course. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who was having trouble identifying a research question of interest, the philosophy of science element -- while engaging -- functioned as a distraction from the final project (which could be more of a testament to my working style). The relationship between the philosophical underpinnings of science and methods of literature review sometimes felt tenuous. \r\n\r\nI feel like pointing to a few case studies that paint how a theory unfolds over multiple weeks, instead of individual examples, might help point toward a better direction. I also found the focus on developing a publishable paper to be stressful. "

            "\u00a0This was a great fundamental course that helped to prepare me for coursework ahead and taught me to think critically about nursing theory, conceptual problems, and philosophy.  I would recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It situated nursing as an intellectual discipline and illuminated through conversation and close analysis how it functions as a knowledge-generating enterprise. It made clear how theory ties to data, and what kind of thinking is essential to science. "
