            "\u00a0I think this course is great in theory but was unable to be carried out well. All assignments or questions asked as well as the information shared was very repetitive and of a basic level of understanding - I did not feel that it was a graduate level class as I had expected. I think there is great merit to the topic and the class could be so beneficial but i dont feel that I learned anything new nor was I very challenged except for some on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really interesting discussion about topics related to addictions. Offers new ways to think about many problems related to public health. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good overview of health policies regarding addiction. \r\nWeaknesses: Not enough focus/exploration of economic principles involved or research methods (eg diff-in-diff- heard a lot about this in presentations but never heard about it in other PH classes). The readings are very long (example: Dram shops) and a lot of them are very old. I feel like the reading list needs updating/refreshing. The time taken up for the reading and reading responses was extensive- I feel like the number of reading responses should be reduced or they should be made shorter. I felt like this course was aimed at a low level- for example explaining causality to public health students- I felt was a waste of class time/the wrong class to be doing this in. I realise it is dual listed for undergrads but perhaps if people want to refresh on basic topics- provide a learning packet of pre-reading?\r\nAlso look at the points rating for assignments vs reading responses- they take the same amount of time/amount of reading but points allocation is quite different. \r\nPossibly would have been less arduous if presentations could have been spread out over the semester rather than three full sessions of presentations ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- very interesting course material\r\n- readings are fascinating. Assignment structure ensures I actually do them.\r\n- final paper very flexible and have room to choose a cool topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-though not particularly difficult, quite a lot of work each week. 4-5 page assignment due every week.\r\n-Professor v. Disorganized, slides needed more proofreading \r\n- Econ not really discussed that explicitly for some classes ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the topics this covered in this course, and I appreciated the student engagement in addition to the lectures. I think the lectures would benefit from being streamlined and updated as there is a lot of great new research out there in this area of study. ",
            "\u00a0a bit disorganized but interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very experienced in the topic, responsive to class questions\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like possibly this class made have been put together in a rush. The powerpoints were pretty terrible, a lot of slides were repeated class after class, they weren't very well formatted, and often slides were skipped over so it was hard to know where we were at because they left the classes without much structure. I fell like the TF or an assistant could really work on improving the slides for next year. ",

            "\u00a0Dr Sindelar is very out of touch with the reality of substance use and addiction. She frequently spouted half truths, was uninformed on issues and shut down students who tried to correct/ interject things into class.  The class correcting her became a weekly thing. I don't think Prof Sindelar is current enough to be able to teach this class efficiently. The class would be much better with an expert on drugs and addiction. Prof Sindelar is a great researcher and economist, but she's a terrible professor for this subject matter. "
