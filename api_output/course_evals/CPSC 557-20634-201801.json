Much of the course is taught by students, so there is variability in the quality of individual lectures, but overall, the material and discussions were interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Prof. Fischer is awesome, willing to provide help to us. ",

I found that this course changed the way I think about technology and has influenced how I act on the Internet and in my software engineering processes. I suspect students will consider this course a gut since it's a computer science course with no coding, and that alone is a major problem. I am shocked that we don't require students to learn about the ethical implications of their computer science endeavors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Awesome CS course, critical thinking all the time. ",
