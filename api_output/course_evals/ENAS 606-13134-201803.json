I think the class would be much more applicable to additional students. \r\n\r\nBiggest weakness: Time of class. Having class in the middle of lunch time made it difficult to concentrate and I had to miss meetings that were only held at lunch time. ",
            "\u00a0Without tests I was not forced to try to retain the information being taught. At the same time I still learned a good amount and the class was more an overview course of polymers for graduate level research. ",
            "\u00a0The free flowing nature of this course was both a strength and weakness. I was interested in a lot of the material, but I would often question why I was learning it and where it was useful. More real life examples would be useful to motivate learning in this less structured course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was excellent. All of the subject matter was very interesting and covered in a very understandable way, even for undergraduates. My only criticism would be that the course is probably better suited to be covered in two semesters instead of one, so the topics can be covered in more depth. ",

The course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of polymer physics, and you get to learn about a lot of interesting topics that you probably have never seen before.
