            "\u00a0Strengths - ? This math will probably have little to no influence on my research career. I also have a math degree, so most of the material was review. \r\nWeaknesses - The professor and the chosen textbook. The professor was well-meaning, but 1. couldn't give a clear and concise lecture if his job depended on it, and 2. did not at all make the expectations for the class clear (we never knew when we had homework, or even what chapter of the textbook we were discussing). The textbook was also not helpful in presenting the material - I frequently found myself referring back to the textbook I used in my undergraduate PDEs class because its explanations were much more thorough. ",
            "\u00a0The material is fine, but the method of teaching needs improvement. ",
            "\u00a0This class needs to be more structured. There was never a set lesson plan, the professor would cover material and then somehow conclude that we finished the chapter. He never seemed to approach 90% of what was covered in the book, which was an awful text. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely unhelpful. The professor did not teach, but told us to read the book by ourselves. No useful materials were learned. ",
            "\u00a0The content was interesting and simple enough, but the textbook was hard to follow. Also, it was difficult to go back and forth between using Mathematica and then solving problems by hand. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely not. The professor was terrible, the lectures were dry and difficult to follow (and often went 15-20 minutes over the allotted time), and I frequently found myself submitting work unfinished or poorly done because I was so fed up with this class. My advice to Yale: get a new professor to revamp this course or cancel it entirely. ",
            "\u00a0No, not unless the instructor is different, or the method is radically changed. There seemed to be no teaching or learning going on the entire year and everything was either self-taught or not learned at all. ",
            "\u00a0No. I caution anyone from taking this class unless you are a math major and have extensive experience with this coursework and Mathematica. I mistakenly believed the course description when it stated this was an Introduction to graduate level mathematics. I thought that the class would be self-contained;  review some advanced math topics and push your understanding forward to help with future research. Wow. That was a very incorrect assumption. Professor Vaisnys does not teach in a traditional fashion. The class was him discussing high level applications of some topic that usually does not relate to the coursework he assigns. So each class was usually a waste of 1.5 hours (he always goes over the 1.25 hour mark advertised) and then on top of that his assignments took me, albeit I lacked  recent math experience, around 10 hours per assignment. Thus, it was hard to have time to read the AWFUL text book and try to understand what he expected us to learn on our own, which was basically everything since he never covered much pertinent information in class.\r\nHe is better in a 1-on-1 setting, but does not answer questions directly and even a yes-or-no question can take five minutes as he switches from tangent to tangent. If the TA had not been so stellar, I would probably not have received any credit on any graded coursework.\r\nPlease, heed my warning and read the reviews and make sure you are really ready for a frustrating semester prior to submitting this class in your semesters course load. Professor V is a brilliant person, but he does not convey it well to those who are not so fluent with high level mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course was the worst experience I have ever had over the course of my academic life, and the professor is quite literally the worst teacher I have ever encountered at any university. Students are expected to breeze through an incredibly dense and complicated text book and teach themselves without any assistance from lectures due to the professors refusal to give explanations on concepts or go through example problems. It was as if the professor did everything he could to avoid actually teaching the material. When addressing questions during class, rather than providing a thoughtful response, the professor preferred to beat around the bush without actually offering up anything of worth. Homework mainly consisted of material that was not taught during the actual lectures. Additionally, it is incredibly disappointing that the university decided against making previous students evaluations of the course available during the registration period. If you are not required to take this course, avoid it. If you are required to take this course and it is taught by this professor, speak to your advisor about possible alternatives. The teaching fellow Matt was the only positive I took away from this experience, as he clearly cared about the students performance and devoted a lot of time outside of class to going over concepts. If anything, I am leaving this course with a poorer understanding of mathematics than when I entered. ",
            "\u00a0Highly no. There is absolutely no point to take this course. The professor neither taught us nor helped us on learning on our own. Extremely unorganized. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this class because I believe this class required extensive self-teaching due to the lack of much needed teaching of the fundamental concepts. "
