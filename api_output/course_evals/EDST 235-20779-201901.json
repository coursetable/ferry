            "\u00a0What didn't I learn taking this course? I learned a lot about how to decode rhetoric, and locate underlying desires, implications, and complications in the writing of any and all cultural discourse. This sentence seems simple to write, but took the work of an entire semester. I also learned, critically, about how much I still don't know; we discussed problems with seemingly no solution, and talked about issues that I didn't even know existed within language that posited itself as helpful. Additionally, I learned a lot about my own personal experience and the experiences of my classmates in ways that were both deeply personal and broadly implicated in culture and politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how different scholars and popular opinionists have conceptualized the American culture wars. I came to understand how the \"culture wars\" are primarily a coded term to talk about racism. I also thought critically about how to incorporate social justice programming and messages in a productive way in American classrooms. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an ability to look critically at the history of our country and how it informs our lives today. ",
            "\u00a0this course changed the way I think about education ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about education and its use in fighting culture wars. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned of the culture wars and how they are embedded within education. I was able to read articles by many different authors discussing certain culture wars. I also learned the many ways racism continues to present itself. ",
            "\u00a0A fuller history of the development of \"the culture wars\" in the US, insight into both the conservative and liberal arguments/rationales behind the culture wars, critical race studies topics "

            "\u00a0This course was a wild ride! I'm not sure if I've recovered from the seminars enough to offer critiques or praise; I think that the class was challenging in a way that no other class I've taken at Yale was. I also think that it built an intellectual understanding within me that fundamentally changed the ways that I see politics, culture, social discourse, etc. I cannot offer a designation of these changes as bad (they certainly were hard earned) or good (my instinct is to say good, but this class has also taught me that my instinct often demands deep reflection and criticism). I can say that I deeply enjoyed going to class, and that the course itself was a transformative experience. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it was willing to look at the education system critically, to criticize it for its shortcomings in a no-nonsense manner. It was inspiring and helped many students shed their assumptions about how this country works. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is great and needs no edits. ",
            "\u00a0It challenges me intellectually. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I know the class cannot be lengthened, but it would be great to either have a longer class or meet two times a week. Often, when the discussion was becoming very interesting, the class was ending! ",
            "\u00a0This has been the most eye-opening class I've taken at Yale. With Prof. Zemach-Bersin as a guide, it's impossible not to develop new ways of thinking about the world, education, and inequality and, more so, be compelled to act on it. ",
            "\u00a0This course had some of the best in-class discussion that I've had in my time at Yale. The readings were a lot at times but super engaging, always interesting and insightful. Dr. TZB highly values peer workshopping, and that process was super helpful in writing all three of the papers for this course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but only to those willing to put in the work. This is not a seminar in which you can logistically skip the (numerous) readings. This is also not a seminar in which you can scroll through Facebook. In addition, this is not a seminar that you can attend with a specific set of ideas in mind and a determination to retain those ideas. If you want to take this class without transforming, go somewhere else. But if you do want a class that is difficult yet never feels like work, demands critical introspection yet feels positive, and requires a workload of papers and readings that demand deep and transformative engagement, then absolutely do take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a really important exploration of how the American education system interacts with politics, culture, social justice, and social issues. I think it's a really important thing for all education students to think aboutas education is a lot more than just teaching. Professor ZB is exactly the right person to teach about this issue, to help you break down your constructed ideas, and to guide you on a journey of better understanding how education functions in America. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is certainly my favorite class ever in all schooling. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Talya is awesome and realy cared about students truly understanding the material. She brought up topics and started discussions that are very important and I learned so much because of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was incredibly deep, challenging, and critical. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to turn the lights on parts of society we take for granted as norms with the most passionate, brilliant, and dedicated professor! "
