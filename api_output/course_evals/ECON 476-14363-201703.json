            "\u00a0Very in-depth knowledge about some key components of credit investing, which I would probably not have been exposed to anywhere else at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about distressed debt analysis - an opportunity not truly offered in any other courses at yale ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a broad overview of the extremely interesting field of corporate credit investing. The course balances economic theory and real-world applications in a very satisfying way. Overall, I'd say that this was one of the most practical courses I've taken at Yale. Coming out of the class, I have a much deeper and clearer understanding of debt investing. Students with some prior background in finance and accounting are probably the target demographic. The course starts with a quick intro to bond math and valuation methodologies before launching into the specifics of credit investing. We covered waterfall models, market structure, alternative valuation techniques, CLOs, legal structure, bankruptcy process, exit strategy, and several other topics.\r\n\r\nProf. Rapaport is also a brilliant guy -- there aren't many opportunities to learn directly from someone who is both actively working in the industry and very good at it. The workload isn't too crazy, but it definitely helps to have some prior work experience in finance. Also, it's a plus if you're good at mental math because the lectures move at a quick pace and the math can be tough to follow. There are several problem sets and student exercises, which aren't too difficult if you make sure to ask questions. We also did a number of in-class case studies, which were extremely fun. The class builds toward a final group presentation where you pitch a credit opportunity. By the end, you'll have a pretty strong understanding of how debt investing works. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: a very good mix between theoretical material and practical work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the teacher is brilliant, has a great perspective on the subject matter, and easily shows how the material is linked to real world opportunities through the use of case studies. Weaknesses are that the course at times could be a bit disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting cases but would have appreciated more background material ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is that it provides a rare opportunity for Yale undergrads to do truly applied economic thinking. Unlike most courses that are bogged down in useless theory, this course is extremely practical. Prof. Rapaport also makes sure to explain how the theory differs when applied to reality. The material was extremely interesting and this course was a once-in-a-four-year opportunity to learn from a really talented investor. The final presentations brings it all together in a very effective way.\r\n\r\nAs this was Prof. Rapaport's first course ever, it was a bit disorganized. I think that imposing some more structure would be beneficial for student learning. In addition, the lectures moved very quickly, which made it difficult for some people to follow the material on the fly. By breaking down concepts more, it would be easier for the class to follow in-lecture. "

            "\u00a0This course focuses in a very specific niche of investing, although it does have many implications to other areas. Read the syllabus, and it credit investing seems something you might be interested to look into more depth later in life, take it - Prof. Rapaport is probably one of the best around. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend as the subject matter is extremely relevant and useful. ",
