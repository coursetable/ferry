            "\u00a0So many. The readings of this course were the perfect mix of new and super well known. What was amazing, though, was that this was the first class in which we looked at these major works of theory but actually dove deep into them to make sure we truly understood and engaged with the material -- rather than just memorize enough to mention the talking points at dinner parties or other class debates. The complexities of the films and the richness of the materials were exciting and handled in a way that was rewarding and enlightening. I learned how to analyze film based on more than just the plot, I learned to not be intimidated by theory readings, I learned how to better question artistic and academic works as well as institutions. I gained so much from this course and truly consider it a transformative learning experience. I am a better thinker thank to this course, and this will shape and improve whatever I do next. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to critically engage with western films about migrant subjects. With a focus on biopolitics and the relationship between politics and art, we learned how to articulate the patterns in migrant film which are indicative of the way in which we perceive migrant subjects. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course that tied together work from diverse and inspired thinkers ranging from Fanon to Foucault to Susan Butler and more. Complimenting these readings were films and artists working in migration and geo-politics that provided alternative approaches to the subject matter that simply would not have been possible from texts alone. This course helped me clarify and connect research I had already done in areas of film, migration and post-colonial studies while simultaneously exposing me to new and incredible concepts that will forever change how I view the relationships between migration, global trade, and bio-politics. The close studies of films (and even their promotional materials) also increased my ability to critically assess how film, and art more broadly, can serve to illuminate and also to perpetuate stereotypes and biases. My peers were also engaged in the content and I was able to take away so much from seminar discussions with an incredibly diverse and thoughtful group who were comfortable sharing their thoughts and reflections. Seminar discussions were particularly insightful in this course and I was able to gain additional ways of approaching the material. I realize this is the hope of a seminar yet it is always so rewarding when the interest and commitment to the work is there. ",
            "\u00a0More than in any other class I've taken at Yale, I gained the ability to analyze and ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND high level theoretical texts. I had never taken a film class before at Yale and this class was incredibly illuminating as an intro to film studies.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bradley does an amazing job cutting through all the bullshit Yale classes usually contain (performative commenting, students trying to prove their intellect, speaking of theory so vaguely the conversation becomes meaningless) and asked us to view films with a well developed, flexible, and radical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Reformulate the relationship between politics and aesthetics in a manner that makes you see the world entirely differently. Read really hard texts, but Rizvana makes it easy to understand, and by the end you will be able to use them as academic weapons. "

            "\u00a0The course has incredibly engaging material, but the reading load was a bit too heavy.  Students would be able to give the readings the attention and depth of thought they deserve if the coursework was slightly decreased. ",
            "\u00a0Seminars were incredible and Professor Bradley was a skillful guide through dense content, a wonderful film critic, and a relaxed and effective moderator. There was always a lot of information to cover and a very engaged cohort to balance yet the flow of information and dialogue had a great pace and was always inspiring. The syllabus was well-organized and there was a very natural progression through topics. The films and readings were well paired, resulting in though-provoking class discussions. Given the denseness of the readings this was an especially lively seminar with busy students who actually read the material (!!!) and it was honestly a treat to be able to recharge in this course each week.\r\nThe only issues I found were that the class following ours was always very agressive about entering the room early which was a bit disorienting, and the film screening were constantly plagued with technical issues. ",
            "\u00a0The films and readings were really really good, like life changingly so. I really appreciated how much time we spent working through each text.\r\nI also really appreciated that Professor Bradley was flexible with the syllabus, adjusting it so we could really dig deep into the topics at hand.\r\n\r\nI wish I had received more feedback/worked more on my writing on these topics, because putting all of the intellectual development I experienced in this class into words feels like an important and worthwhile exercise.

            "\u00a0Such an incredible class that will give you so much, intellectually as well as personally. Take it if you are interested in becoming a better and more aware person. Only take it if you want to and are willing to learn about important truths in ways that you are rarely able to. Some of the lessons will blow your mind and give you a lot to grapple with, but that's the point and the exact type of environment I wanted and got. There is a short midterm paper and a 10-12 page final paper plus weekly readings, but THANKFULLY no reading responses or other reading check type of assignments. Every person in this class wanted to and was excited to learn from each other, the works, and Prof. Bradley. One of the most, if not the most, enjoyable class experiences that I've had at Yale. I am neither a film nor an AfAm major and this was still one of the most rewarding and transformative classes I've taken. It might seem initially intimidating, but that was more in my head than anything and ended feeling like one of the most rewarding classes I was welcomed into. It will make me a better thinker and doer in any field because of the lessons we learned and the ways it more importantly taught us to engage with thought. I truly wish this was a yearlong course because even though we learned SO much every week I feel like I just got started. I have no had a seminar fly by as quickly (both each class and the semester overall). Do yourself a favor and take this class, but only if you're ready to give it the energy it deserves. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. One of the few film classes Ive taken that critically engages with the way subjects are constructed on screen and what the implications of that construction is. Plus super interesting and the films and great! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. Course material was wide-ranging without being disorienting or loosing focus and spanned fields from post-colonial literature, to film studies, art installations, and economics. Professor Bradley does an excellent job of combining the work of classic scholars with new artists and authors in a comprehensive and logical fashion. You will learn a lot, yet the information and insights you gain will build in a natural and intellectually exciting way. You will also gain alternative insights from your peers in ways that may be more engaging than other seminars at Yale. There is also a good mixture of presentations, film screenings and texts throughout the semester. Again, regardless of one's major (and I think many if not all in my very diverse cohort would agree) the content in this couse is going to be applicable and interesting. There are many excellent courses at Yale yet The Migrant Image is certainly one of the most exceptional ones I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Bradley is one of the only people teaching the important shit at Yale. You learn about how to engage with the university even as it remains a place where oppression is reproduced over and over. You learn how to read Foucault and ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND it. Prof B doesn't let you move on until you do. I know I'm going to be returning back to the topics and themes of this class again and again. \r\n\r\nIt's a brilliant syllabus because studying the way that migrants have been represented in (mostly) Western/European cinema opens up so so so many other important questions. What is the role of film and art and aesthetics in freedom struggles? How have Europeans constructed their own self identity built on the inclusion/exclusion of migrants? What the heck is a person and why does it matter? \r\n\r\nThis class has been my favorite by far. Please please take it. Even if you're not into film, if you do anything related to ER&M, migration studies, postcolonial studies, it will be super important for you. Or even if you don't, it will still teach you so much. Prof B is one of the only professors I've ever had at Yale who is actually committed to doing the work of liberation and building a new world. ",
            "\u00a0YES - if you are itnerested in postcoonial theory and aesthetics, there is no better class. "
