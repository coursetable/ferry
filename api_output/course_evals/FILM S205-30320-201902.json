            "\u00a0Under professor Casiello's guidance and with the help of a robust syllabus, I gained a more structured understanding of Japanese Anime/Manga, looking at this art form not just as an example of popular entertainment, but a key to understanding societal and historical context, as well as cultural underpinnings of Japanese society and its sphere of influence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic history about Japanese animation and some special technique that  producers, like Miyazaki, use to achieve a well-developed scene. Also, some fascinating culture like cute culture and theory like Cyborg feminism are also included in the course content. Those knowledge help me a lot when watching animes. For the first time, I systematically learn how to evaluate and analyze an anime work. ",
            "\u00a0I understood anime, one of my greatest interests, in another level beyond the superficial purpose of entertainment. By taking the historical and even the psychological content into the analysis of Japanese ACG culture, I was able to know how anime and manga develop through time and consider about their significance in the Japanese society as a representation of the culture and of the people themselves. Besides, I also tried to write long research paper which was still new to me, therefore taking this course indeed helped me to develop my writing skills on long paper assignment. "

            "\u00a0The course could benefit from a more invested group of students, who take the course not just because they have some interest in manga/anime, but also are curious about Japanese culture or the larger themes of social progression, feminism, and visual arts. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe include some content that show the interinfluence of world culture of anime ( how world culture influence it and how it influences world culture) "

            "\u00a0I would recommend any student at Yale who has either a solid interest in anime/manga, Japanese culture or Film studies to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, I have a lot of friends enjoying watching anime, I think this course will give them new insights as I get. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students if they are interested in East Asian culture or Japanese manga/anime. They can indeed understand their interest deeper by connecting this type of fiction media with the actual society. "
