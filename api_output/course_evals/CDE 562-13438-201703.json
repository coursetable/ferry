            "\u00a0My biggest suggestion for this course would be to have more than 2 exams. I felt that there was a lot of information to cover for the 2  which made me feel pressured to memorize the information rather than fully synthesize it. If there were maybe 4 exams throughout the semester (each could build on the next), I think this would help to reaffirm the concepts rather than having to memorize lots of information at one time. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of my favorite courses I've taken at YSPH. Dr. Ferrucci is great at creating a focused yet very interactive lecture environment. I loved the mixture of biology/quantitative content with softer skills, critical analysis, and policy, and found all of the content very interesting. Class activities and discussion sections allowed me to think about class content in different lights and apply it to different scenarios, which I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Very useful course about nutrition. A good balance between facts, literature review, practical info. ",
            "\u00a0very interesting class! wish it could be less memorization and slides and more discussion ",
            "\u00a0Great course, very informative. Sometimes overwhemling in how much material there was but I found it all very informative ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course is a comprehensive introduction to the current state of nutrition and food policy in the U.S. Professor Ferrucci breaks down a very complicated web of conflicting evidence into comprehensible takeaways. The group activities and discussions are really great for sparking productive conversations and learning from each other. ",
            "\u00a0For discussion groups, Maybe more team based case studies instead of discussion of papers. So each week present a case based on the studies. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized and the workload is fair. Professor Ferrucci is extremely passionate about the course material. Her slides are always clear and concise and the assignments are interesting. Overall, the course is well-planned and I am incorporating so much from the course in my everyday life. Thank you for a wonderful experience! ",
            "\u00a0I liked the set up of the lecture and having the discussion class be the following day. Sometimes that pace seemed a bit slow. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course because it gave me scientific backing to understand what foods or food groups are actually good for the body and why. Growing up, we have all been exposed ro such impressions about different foods and viramins and whether they are good cor you, but this course helps you evaluate what the scientific data looks like in aggregate and discerning some of the controversies about food/ vitamins.  It'a also made me WAY more aware about and less gullible to the supplements and food industry and their marketing.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly like how the first and last midnwrmnade weifhed equally and how the first midterm required you to know so many acronyms ( literally writing out what each letter stands for)-- i figure if you know what the acronymn means and how to apply it, that is more useful and getting so many points off on pire memorization isn't helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great.\r\nI recommend that the instructor could add more videos to help us understand the biological reason of certain disease. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught, but at times some of the material seemed rushed. For example, topics like cancer has two to three weeks whereas others only had one. However, the course was a great overview of the field. "

            "\u00a0She structures topics so that the course is very fast-paced and information is very condensed into each lecture. I liked this because it meant we got to cover a lot of topics in depth. She's also a very understanding professor who listens to your concerns. ",
            "\u00a0I think Leah is a wonderful professor who is clearly very passionate about her work. ",
            "\u00a0Again, Dr. Ferrucci is great at creating a space that's focused and also encourages questions/discussions. I loved how open she was to speaking with students about class content outside of the classroom, and giving us extra papers to look at when we were interested. She also did a great job of explaining concepts to the class, and I really appreciated that she made pre-exam power points, topic reviews, and practice exam questions--I always felt like I knew what was expected of me, for assignments and exams alike.

Even though my main research interests are not in nutrition, I learned a lot about how unhealthy my own eating habits were and was motivated to change and increase my intake of certain nutrients (like whole grains) and reduce other intakes (like red meat). You read a lot of journal articles in this class and it really gives you some insight into what the current evidence is on certain foods (and also how to evaluate whether or not you should believe certain studies due to limitations in their designs) ",
