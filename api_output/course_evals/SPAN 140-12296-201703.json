            "\u00a0I improved my grammar, writing, and speaking skills in spanish. ",
            "\u00a0L4 Spanish really rounds off your Spanish education. Much of the grammar is review, but you get much better at using some of the same concepts and constructions you learn in L2 and L3. L4 also allows you to spend more time appreciating Spanish/Hispanic literature, film, and culture. ",
            "\u00a0While it was annoying at the time to go to a 9:25am class every day, this made sure that I was constantly practicing Spanish.  I certainly learned some vocabulary and grammar topics, but the most valuable aspect of this course was a newfound comfortability speaking and writing in Spanish.  These skills in particular, along with some reading comprehension and listening, were definitely emphasized in this course and led to better overall understanding of the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0I think I became a much more confident speaker, learned a lot about tenses, and also became a much more capable reader. ",
            "\u00a0My skills of Spanish speaking and writing immensely increased by taking this course. I thoroughly enjoyed improving an array of skills and talents. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like my spanish speaking skills improved and i really enjoyed the class! ",
            "\u00a0I substantially improved my ability to speak fluently in Spanish by expanding my vocabulary and making my conjugation and grammar skills more automatic. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish has greatly improved since the beginning of the semester. I've developed my listening, reading, and comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish speaking and Spanish grammar improved a lot by taking this course. You do a lot of talking with a partner which really improves your Spanish conversational skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned relatively advanced Spanish grammar concepts, gained new vocabulary, and most importantly, greatly improved my speaking skills! ",
            "\u00a0L4 was definitely a step up from L3 but I was able to become much more proficient over the course of the semester. It was challenging at times but I truly believe my fluency and grammar improved a great amount. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish grammar, as well as my speaking and writing abilities. "

        [
            "\u00a0Great way to learn! Only downside is since the classes have 14ish people, you don't get that much speaking time. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved through less reliance on supersite. Some of the instructions for activities were unclear, and with only one or two attempts, it was very hard to do well because of the lack of clarity not due to a misunderstanding of the Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0One of this course's strengths was the level of interaction with students and the varied materials used to learn Spanish.  While we worked out of the textbook a lot for practice activities, we also watched films, read a short book, went to the Yale University Art Gallery to look at some paintings, had a mock trial, acted out dialogues, and gave presentations on topics ranging from Mexican soap operas to political revolutions.  A weakness of this course was the content of some of the readings.  Some were really excellent and interesting, but some were quite bland. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum is really well planned out and the assignments corresponded well with where we were in the class. That being said, I think there were a few too many assessments clustered around the same periods. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, the course was conducted almost seamlessly. The professors in this department are so incredibly organized and I felt as though it was thoughtfully planned to the utmost degree. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor was amazing ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I am still not as strong at listening, but my speaking skills definitely improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course meets every day, which is important for cementing the skills and material covered (as it is a foreign language). The extra material not covered in the textbook was, in my opinion, what helped me develop most in the course. The readings from the cuaderno and Las Batallas were most helpful, as being forced to read significant texts in Spanish greatly increased my fluency in all areas. The oral presentations, though daunting, were also incredibly productive for practicing and increasing spoken fluency. ",
            "\u00a0Language courses tend not to be the most exciting, but Professor Cividanes made this class well above average. She is very friendly and is an expert in her field. It can be nerve-wracking to present to the class or write an essay in a foreign language but she is always nice in her suggestions/criticisms to improve your Spanish, and never makes you feel embarrassed. L4 Spanish as a whole has some entertaining short stories, short films, etc. to break up the monotony of learning grammar. It can seem relentless having about an hour of homework for Spanish every day and a quiz, test, essay, or project nearly every week, but it pays off because the grading ends up being very spread out, and there is no true final. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the course was definitely more difficult than L3 but it was always manageable. Tests were a lot harder but the grades were all evened out by participation and class presentations. There was always room to participate in class to boost your grade. ",
            "\u00a0The texts and movies were very interesting, and I also enjoyed the cultural and art gallery activities. Sometimes the grammar activities in class were a little repetitive, but that really can't be avoided in a class that meets 5 times a week. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend L4 Spanish for those looking to take another step towards fluency. After taking L4, you will generally be able to understand and communicate in speech and writing, even if it still might be a bit clunky and slow. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  I'm sure that a lot of times this course is taken to complete the language requirement or as a stepping stone to L5, and this is certainly a good way to do either of those.  Along the way, students will actually learn a lot of Spanish and become much more confident in their ability to speak the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think I improved my Spanish greatly and that the course was very fair. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think this level of Spanish was when it started to be the most enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but make sure you take it with this professor! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It helped me become a better speaker and improved my writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material was interesting and engaging, and the structure of the course, although it is a significant workload, is evenly distributed over the semester, so it keeps things very manageable. There is no way to complete this course and not drastically improve one's Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to continue to improve your Spanish, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because the work is not too difficult, just a little time-consuming. It is unfortunate that the class meets every day because it makes your schedule feel very monotonous, but it is a pretty fun and engaging class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are able to place into L4 Spanish right out of high school, definitely do it, because although it may be tedious it is an easy way of completing your language requirement. Otherwise, it is a good class for people who want to improve the fluency of their Spanish for study abroad or other reasons. Definitely try to get a good teacher for this course because that can really determine how much you enjoy it. Professor Cividanes is definitely the best, but none of them are awful. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class with Cividanes if you can, she was amazing. L4 is tough but not impossible if you keep up with the readings and homework and don't fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish. "
