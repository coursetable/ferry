            "\u00a0This course helped me start to think really critically and constructively about the words I choose to use and how I use them. Yes, I grew as a creative writer, definitely, but it's also affected the way I even write emails. Michael asks for a precision of language and metaphors that's been really eye-opening for me and sharpened my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about reading and writing fiction, especially down to the level of a single sentence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about writing and reading fiction. We spent a lot of time talking about the different elements of fiction and how they all contribute to creating a story, the important tenants that lead to effective fiction, and (of course) how all those tenants may be broken. We read many stories with an eye towards how those tenants were effectively used, and reading them led to understanding of our own fiction. I also learned a lot of techniques through reading other peoples exercises and stories, as well as from hearing peoples comments on others stories. ",
            "\u00a0In a course like this it's particularly hard to describe exactly what I learned. I certainly came out of this course with a better understanding of how writers think, how to make text and characters interesting, how to make writing feel fresh. But of course, those are not things to be learned in one semester. I think the biggest thing I took away from the course was that, despite the inevitable nonlinearity of creative projects, they can turn out in the end  or, at least, evolve into something new and unexpected  if you put enough work into them.

            "\u00a0Strength: Michael as a human being. He cares so much about his students and creates a really great seminar dynamic where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts candidly and unpretentiously. He also takes such an interest in getting to know his students, taking the class out for \"cocktails\" after class and things like that. He gives thoughtful feedback on your writing and makes himself as available as he can to answer questions and work with you one-on-one\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated a bit more of a workshop-type class, as this only becomes a workshop halfway through. But I understand since it's a beginning class you have to establish fundamentals. There were really no glaring weaknesses. Classes were always engaging and a blast. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to fiction writing. It effectively starts with reading and analyzing \"successful\" short stories to understand how to write fiction before transitioning into a writing workshop. I think, however, that it might be more effective if there is more time for the writing workshops at the end of the semester, and less emphasis on the classes that are just about discussing already published short stories. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fantastic class. The readings and discussions were illuminating, thoughtful, and well-facilitated, and the workshops were incredibly helpful. My only critique is that the process of getting into the class was quite stressful, but I'm not sure there's a good solution to that. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so much fun. I love that it met once per week for a longer period of time because it allowed us to have really deep and thoughtful discussions. I think the readings and overall structure of the course was very well designed to facilitate learning, and the mix of student backgrounds led to very interesting conversations as well. I also love the workshop portion at the end. I would love to have gotten to write more stories throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I was almost never stressed out about this course. It's not structured to make students kill themselves over crafting a perfect story. It's a collaborative environment for people from all different writing backgrounds and experiences. The time you put into your writing is yours to choose. Projects were not graded; we just got feedback, suggestions for improvement. It was a class designed to support the creative process, at least to the extent that it could in a university setting.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness  I wouldn't even call it a weakness  is that we only started writing for real towards the end of the semester. At the beginning, we would complete weekly writing exercises along with a reading. For me, the exercises didn't prove as instructive as the final project. It was only once I sat down to write something longer that things began to fall into place for me. I might suggest that students do more writing at the beginning of the semester, but that suggestion may sacrifice the low stress of this course, and perhaps its accessibility to newer writers (myself included).

            "\u00a0Yes! It's that class that will brighten your week, and getting to take a class with a novelist of his acclaim is super cool. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student that has the slightest interest in writing. If you are fortunate enough to get into this class, you should absolutely take it. Michael Cunningham is absolutely incredible, andalthough there are no rules to writing fictionhell teach you everything you have to know. Every aspect of this course is incredibly well thoughtout and the short stories that you read are all literary masterpieces. If you absorb what Michael has to teach you, then you may be producing a semblance of a literary masterpiece by the end of the semester. Best class at Yale, hands down. If I could take it 20 times, I would. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone, whether you're a committed writer or just want to learn a little more about fiction. ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE THIS CLASS. It will stretch you and teach you so much about writing and life. We went out to dinner as a class and got to know each other, and learned so much about fiction and ourselves along the way. The readings are amazing, the writing is fun, and the people surrounding you are fantastic as well. Great class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Hands down. Take this course. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. "
