            "\u00a0I was able to improve my Chinese proficiency. Specifically, I was able to build on top of what I had learned in the previous semester and broaden my knowledge of Chinese grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0how to survive in china and discuss economic, political affairs. ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly expanded my vocabulary and ability to use Chinese in more formal of settings. With relevant course topics, each unit of the class gave us the opportunity to learn important vocabulary and grammar structures and implement what we learned in writing essays and other forms of practice. I think my ability to scan texts for comprehension has improved due to this course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I further developed my Chinese language abilities, particularly speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Furthermore, I learned a great deal about Chinese culture and History ",
            "\u00a0Learned some more Chinese. Really started to feel like I could grasp Chinese language material that wasn't designed for students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use advanced Chinese grammar in official and conversational settings. I also learned how to write more official essays and traditional characters. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I liked the fact that the course used authentic Chinese material in the latter half of the semester. One of the limitations of learning Chinese in a classroom setting is that it is hard to become conversationally fluent since students only get to know how to understand standardized Mandarin. Listening to authentic material helped me engage with that limitation. ",
            "\u00a0strength is the high volume of tests which makes sure that you always learn the lessons incrementally rather than simply cramming. I don't think there's enough a focus on writing, especially if we have to write on the exam. If we don't practice writing characters during the year, we should simply be able to type on the final for the essay portion ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course is its structure. Each unit has balanced components of vocabulary memorization, grammar usage and writing practice. In addition to these elements, there are also opportunities to engage with Chinese culture both inside and outside of the classroom. One weakness of this course is that it seems to sacrifice oral practice. Although there is an hour long session with the TF in Chinese, I think the class could benefit from having more opportunities for debate and discussion during class time. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course does and excellent job of teaching new vocabulary and grammar as well as history/culture. I can think of know way in which it can be improved majorly. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching staff is incredibly attentive and reasonable (will ask you to prioritize sleep over finishing assignments). ",
            "\u00a0I adored the speaking portions of the class, but I felt that sometimes the written tests tested things we didn't totally cover, like finicky grammar differences. I wish we covered that more closely in class. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have taken CHNS 150, or to those who would like to seriously hone their proficiency in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's hard but worth it ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This course sets up a strong foundation for further pursuit of studying Chinese and is taught extremely well. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student looking to further improve their Chinese language speaking abilities. Chinese 151 challenges you to use more complex vocabulary and develop better arguments through writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I recommend almost any course in the L1-L5 Chinese sequence. All of the professors are amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The Chinese department has been incredibly supportive and fun, and I've learned so much. "
