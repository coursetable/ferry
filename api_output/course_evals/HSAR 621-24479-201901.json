            "\u00a0This course gave me a good overview of the religious art and iconography of the premodern period, which will be important for my work. It also encouraged me to think critically about how I conceptualize time as well as the similarities and differences between history and memory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the pre-modern and early modern memory traditions. ",
            "\u00a0Ancient, medieval and Renaissance treatises on memory that helped to gain analytical skills when exploring a work of art, as well as strategies to improve our own memories. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings that we used in this course, and I also enjoyed looking at primary sources at the Beinecke. So much fun! I did feel like the in class summaries that students gave of the readings weren't particularly helpful. We all read the readings so I don't know how much a summary really helped. Maybe this could be improved by having students engage more critically with the theories/methods that the historians were using or have students themselves pick relevant primary sources to look over in class. ",
            "\u00a0Pro: worked together with primary sources from the Beinecke, provided hands-on experience\r\nCon: weekly student presentations about the readings are ineffective. Instead of focusing on the readings one-by-one, all readings should be instilled into the discussion at once. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was a really fun course. I thought the subject matter was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. The classes were very well structured and flowed nicely from one week to the next. It was fascinating to see the connections across time, for example between ancient memory techniques and medieval conceptions of memory. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, an intellectually stimulating subject that is relevant to our lives even today "
