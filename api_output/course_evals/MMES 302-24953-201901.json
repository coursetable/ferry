            "\u00a0I think this course really pushed my thinking about migration and the dialogue around migrant and cultural transitions. It also definitely gave me a new perspective on memoir reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be a better writer, a better listener, and to better understand the importance of contextualizing anything I read with historical background. I also learned to appreciate memoirs -- this class made me want to read more of them and to parse through my own experiences through writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of how authors navigate the relationship between their own personal lives and the political/historical context in which they live. I also thought a lot about how writers can describe their own lives and their families to an American audience without falling into common tropes about the Middle East/Northern African region of the world. ",
            "\u00a0This class exposed us to the genre of memoir as a literary form that can explore personal and broader histories. The course was particularly focused on narratives from the Middle East and on engaging with these narratives in terms of both their stylistic focus and concern. Ultimately, the course asked us to practice some of these narratives methods through the final assignment in which we wrote our own family histories. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze literature both within and outside of its historical context. How to think critically about social movements, and about how memoirs are written. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this seminar (and all of Prof. Mirakhor's other classes)  100% would recommend. The discussions we had were invigorating, and Prof. Mirakhor's guidance was always passionate and enthusiastic. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the weekly posts, and appreciated Professor Mirakhor's discussion of these in class. I think it forced all of the students to be engaged and to reflect even more on our thinking. I also think the selection of readings was very thoughtful -- the supplementary readings reflected well on the memoirs we were reading, and pushed me to deepen my thinking on the central themes we discussed.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think the evaluation method of the course was a bit stressful, as our first paper was not due until several months into the course. Other than that, I really loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Mirakhor is pretty incredible, discussions were great, and the class was really engaged with the material and topics covered.\r\nNo weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0It is fantastic that such a course exists--rarely do experiences and narratives from the Middle East get much airtime standing alone and speaking for themselves, outside of the reductive security apparatus lingo of Global Affairs and other disciplines at Yale. Moreover, even within ERM and literature classes, Middle Eastern perspectives seem nearly invisible.\r\nTherefore, as a student of Middle Eastern background, I felt gratified for the opportunity to see voices like my own represented in a syllabus.\r\nUnfortunately, I found that even in this class, a number of the text selections overly focused on outsider narratives of Middle Eastern societies--and some, rather explicitly, reinforcrd Orientalist tropes.\r\nThis would have been fine if more courses such as this existed--in that case the choice of every text wouldn't seem so high stakes. \r\nOverall, Mirakhor is a formidable and incisive instructor who pushes her students to think more deeply and move beyond characterizing the texts as simply good/bad, Orientalist/subaltern, etc. She encourages close reading and rigor of thought and writing. \r\nOn the other hand, she often seemed a bit inaccessible and very busy. We were confused at a few different points throughout the course regarding expectations for assignments, but all felt too hesitant to ask.\r\nIt would be nice if Professor Mirakhor encouraged more intellectual risk-taking in the form and content of our writing, and perhaps had regularly scheduled office hours to make meeting with her outside of class more straightforward.\r\nFinally, I think her teaching and syllabi could be more sensitive to the trauma that students of various backgrounds may bring into the classroom in regards to the class topics. The texts we read frequently discussed graphic state-sponsored and political violence; many students in the class were able to approach these narratives with cold remove, many of us were not and these backgrounds affected our ability to perform.

            "\u00a0Professor Mirakhor is very engaging and gives a lot of feedback to help her students learn. She is also very knowledgeable on the subjects she teaches. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I think the material was interesting, the class discussions were great, and I felt as though my writing and thinking developed and improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class has so much to teach not only about writing, and writing/reading memoirs in particular, but also about histories in the Middle East and the popular imagination when it comes to these topics. Also, Professor Mirakhor is great, and I would recommend taking any class with her before you graduate. ",
