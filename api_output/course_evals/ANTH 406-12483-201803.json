            "\u00a0Deep histories of a lot of really fascinating case studies, a lot of practice developing oral argument and discussion skills, the chance to think about the environment and political thought in new ways ",
            "\u00a0In Rivers, you learn about the political ecology/economy of the world's waterways. Furthermore, you learn how to assess some of the most fundamental questions humans face. Listening to Prof. Scott speak about his experiences in academia and outside of it also allows for enlightenment about living a meaningful, just, and worthwhile life. Also, you get to spend an entire semester studying a single river on your own, which in itself leads to a great academic experience. ",
            "\u00a0I developed so many insights! This course helped me combine several of my interests that I had previously thought of as being separate from each other. For example, river systems are important for both humans and non-humans in several interesting parallel ways. Furthermore, human beings and their actions impact so much more than what I realized. I feel like this course opened up lots of new avenues for inquiry into the environment that I have been looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think of the rivers as a very complex and rich phenomenon and place, with many histories and lives that happen in or around them ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history, politics, and human geography surrounding rivers all around the globe. The amount of information we learned was extensive and covered a wide swath of topics beyond just rivers themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that the repercussions of human actions on ecosystems are much larger than we typically imagine them to be. I really liked the approach of intertwining politics and rivers, and looking at rivers both through repercussions on human groups and minority populations as well as beyond the human impact. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing class readings and lectures from Professor Scott\r\nWeaknesses: really no systematic mechanism for student feedback at all.. we didn't receive a single piece of graded work all semester except for the final paper, which wasn't really cumulative except for our presentations on them in week 10. I understand the intent of a class evaluated on oral participation but to depend almost entirely on oral participation without giving students any sense of how they're doing or what to improve on doesn't make much sense ",
            "\u00a0Being able to sit in a room with Prof. Scott for two hours a day is probably one of the best educational experiences a student can have at Yale. He's one of the greatest minds on campus, and one of the most gracious people at Yale. He facilitates discussions incredibly well, and always provides useful considerations when students ask and answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave the students lots of room to explore topics on their own and was not overcrowded with useless assignments. Both of these things are strengths. While I would rate the workload/number of graded assignments as a good thing overall, one of the drawbacks of this was that there were not a lot of opportunities to receive professor feedback on one's performance in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were enjoyable, even though the connection with the assigned reading was not always clear. The discussion were very rich and engaging too. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very interesting material, great seminar discussions, very knowledgeable and approachable professor\r\nWeaknesses - very few that i can even think of ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course talked about many different issues relating to rivers and covered a lot of ground conceptually in relation to aquatic ecosystems. It did a very good job reworking definitions of what we consider to be a river, and it expanded my view concerning how I envision humanity's role as a species in relation to river systems. I enjoyed having the guest speakers who came to speak to us, and I loved the final research paper project. In terms of weaknesses, I would have liked to read about a greater variety of rivers not within the U.S. and Europe (we read a lot of material relating to the Mississippi and the Rhine, but I would have liked to have had a bit more variety). I think also there were sections of the course that became a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Not the best seminar I've taken... could use more variety, more frequent assignments, and shorter readings. ",
            "\u00a0Each class Professor Scott cold-called on two students to summarize and analyze the reading. This seemed like a weakness at first, but it forced me to do the reading every week which was a great strength. I feel like I learned a lot more because of this. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Giving an evaluation of this class is difficult just because it isn't really a class in the traditional sense? It's more of a book club about rivers - read a book every week and come into class prepared to talk about it. Scott himself framed the class as a personal foray into a book he wants to write on rivers, and I never really felt that this was a class structured around the student experience. That said, Scott is brilliant and fascinating to listen to, and our class discussions were some of the most engaging that I've had in my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested about political ecology or stateless people, take this course! This semester, we only had 9 students in the seminar. Though its great for the seminar to be on such a person level, it's a shame that more students don't get to experience what is the best seminar I've ever taken at Yale!! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student! This course is fantastic. It is an opportunity to explore new ideas and topics without a lot of pressure to bring back a particular grade, and as such gives students room to do real learning. Because it is structured this way, however, only students with a lot of self-motivation to do the readings and come ready to engage during discussion will get something out of it, so be ready to take your education into your own hands! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it would open your mind to think of how rivers work and how are they related to the life histories of humans and other species ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I most definitely would. Its a very interesting class with very interesting course material, and professor Scott is very knowledgeable and kind. Discussions are interesting and very different from week to week. It has a heavy reading lid, but it isnt too bad if you are interested in the material. ",
            "\u00a0No-- we only had one major assignment, our final paper. We received minimal instruction and little feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it, it was very interesting and is certainly a unique class at Yale. "
