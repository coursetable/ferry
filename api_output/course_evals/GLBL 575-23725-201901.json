            "\u00a0I developed a strong foundation in domestic national security law. I learned to apply legal frameworks and stitch in case law into my legal arguments. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Rangappa was such a great professor; she's so knowledgeable about the subject and so willing to help when students have questions about cases and how law works in general.  The separation of cases by different topics is so helpful as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths  Asha is really engaging. The text can be dry, but shes lively and knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeakness  more application. A simulation would be very cool in this class. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend. Its fundamental to understanding national security and touches on crucial philosophical questions about right of the individual vs protection of the state. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You will gain build legal analysis on the political issues, which are often missed in the political science classes. Also, it will be a great bridge to your academic endeavors if you are interested in applying a law school. "
