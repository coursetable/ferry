            "\u00a0Honestly, I learned that philosophy is not the subject for me. However, the course was quite informative in this regard and so I don't regret taking it. I furthered my knowledge on Jewish thought as a whole, and, coming from an area where I had little exposure to Judaism, the material was enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as if I have a basic understanding of the progression of Jewish philosophy over the past millennium. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good understanding of the Jewish philosophical tradition. I found it interesting to see how Jewish identity and experience impacts a person's worldview. I also developed skills in philosophical analysis and interpretation that I think will be relevant to all types of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to view Jewish philosophy in its historical contexts and intricacies, which I had little exposure to prior. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a good survey of ancient and modern Jewish Philosophers. The class challenged me to reevaluate my conception of God and how God and religion have been continuously reinterpreted to meet the demands of the day. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The lectures can get very bland to be honest. Furthermore, the syllabus said no prior knowledge of Judaism is assumed for the course, but that's an unfair statement, in my opinion. Perhaps a more accurate disclaimer is: \"no prior knowledge of Jewish philosophy required.\" Unconditionally, though, a knowledge of philosophy is required, and the learning curve was pretty steep for me because this was my first philosophy course EVER. Don't take this as a first course in the subject. It is mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors who really seem to know what they're doing and have a niche interest in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0The course was thought-provoking and presented a whole range of information. However it felt like a lecture with a question section. We focused too much on the history and didn't get into the philosophical discussion until the final 1/3 of each class period. ",
            "\u00a0The course had good breadth, in terms of content, style and time period. I also felt it interesting to see how certain thinkers responded to earlier ones, in particular Maimonides, who seemed to have an influence on almost all the philosophers in the course. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that there are many reading, which allow for a lot of depth to be covered the course (a great thing). However, in class, because not everyone was  familiar with the religious and philosophical terms using in the readings, discussion sometimes went very slowly. The course is still great regardless of background in Jewish philosophy but some more emphasis on learning terms and basic concepts would've helped when diving into the bulk of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a good selection of readings and discussions, but the assignments were infrequent, not well spaced, and feedback was not sufficient. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they are genuinely interested in BOTH Judaism AND philosophy. In my opinion, a background in philosophy is absolutely necessary for the course, and a background in Jewish thought certainly would help. I had neither of these things, and this kind of bit me in the butt. Note that this class, despite the low work rating, is NOT A GUT. Be prepared to get as much out of this class (intellectually and grade-wise) as you put into it. I certainly put very little into the course until the papers were assigned, and I regret waiting so long. ",
            "\u00a0Though I enjoyed it, as is, this course did not engender discussion or thought far beyond what I might have had had I done the reading on my own. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who desires an overview of the Jewish philosophical tradition, yet in a good amount of detail as well. I feel that the course balanced detail and breadth very well. The instructor also emphasized the interaction between thinkers which was certainly one of the most interesting parts of the course for me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Obviously if you're interested in Jewish philosophy, but also if you're curious about studying more rationalist or dialogic philosophy. Prof. Franks not only has an incredible wealth of knowledge but also cares deeply about teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to students interested in diving into a very specific section of philosophy, and I think regardless of one's passion for Jewish philosophy specifically, the contents of the course still teach students thinking skills and ideas that can be applies elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good survey course - you get a taste of a variety of stuff, and if you're not familiar with any of the material, could be a good intro. Probably less ideal if you're looking to go in depth with a particular thing. "
