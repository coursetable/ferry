Going into the class, I really did not think I would get much out of it because of the remedial math, but I was surprised to find that a lot of what we did was pretty applicable to the intermediate microeconomics course I was taking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good amount about matrices and probability in this class. I also slightly learned how to use gephy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned almost nothing in this course. As a non-math oriented student, I signed up because I thought that it would be an interesting and applicable subject alongside fulfilling my requirement, but the way in which it was taught was taught made no effort to be it either of these things. I suppose I learned the absolute basics about the way networks function, but I could have learned so, so much more if this class had been better taught. ",

It's much easier to understand/learn new concepts with whole numbers rather than repeating decimals. I also wish there were more examples to prepare for the midterm/final with because some of the questions on both caught me a little off guard (that is referring more to the final). ",

She assumed that we already were able to make complex mathematical connections that were above the level required to take the class. There was little to no effort made to make the course relevant to the world we live in, or to engage students and help them to fully understand the material. The course could be improved by hiring a new professor or teaching this one how to work with students instead of just talking at them while writing out extremely confusing demonstrations on the board. Although she was a nice woman, the professor didn't seem excited to teach the class in the slightest, and it showed. ",

All of the equations learned were shown to have real world implications in a variety of different fields of study.  The final project which is worth 40% of your total grade provides students with an excellent opportunity to apply what they learned to a topic of special interest to them. ",
