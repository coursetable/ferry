            "\u00a0I learned the process behind both executing original scientific research and writing up those results into a paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a research project and write a scientific paper at the end, which was no small feat. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analysis data and draw inferences from it as well as learning how to look through sources to build a good background. I also  become more familiar with how to write a scientific paper and prepare a poster. ",
            "\u00a0Improve use of scientific method. ",
            "\u00a0I performed actual lab research for the first time. It was extremely fruitful and exciting. I had guidance and also a lot of independence. ",
            "\u00a0I got a sense of what lab work and research actually entails, plus I am now more experienced at navigating the literature, running analyses, and presenting my findings. ",
            "\u00a0Time management for independent research\r\nData analysis and programming\r\nHow micro-level observation and study can allow us to approach fundamental questions of ecology and evolution. For instance, fish phylogenetics allows investigation of larger questions of the process of speciation and genetic divergence. "

            "\u00a0This course was great at teaching the student to be an independent researcher. I think the course could be improved by having a bit clearer guidelines on the expectations of the student throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Its entireky self-motivated, which is a strength for some and a weakness for others. ",
            "\u00a0I had a great experience with my advisor, but I would have appreciated more guidance and even suggested deadlines from the major, as I know some other majors provide. For example, a recommended date for a draft would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A colloquium to meet with other E&EB seniors working on independent research for a small amount of time once a week would have been nice. Getting feedback from other students and problem solving as a group would have been a good experience, rather than just going to our PI's with all of our problems we could have learned together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include close cooperation with my advisor and a very detailed and easy to follow set of instructions for writing the paper and creating the poster. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fantastic experience! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - extremely educational in a practical sense, rewarding at the end of the day\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the symposium had several drawbacks. We were expected to be there for 7-8 hours which is ridiculous during reading week. The presentations, while generally good, did not seem to be chosen in a completely fair way. For example, having two presentations about the same organism or ecosystem shuts out people with completely different areas of research. May have been worth asking advisors for projects they thought were done really well, or even having a small informal application process like a 1 paragraph email explaining why your topic would be worth presenting.
