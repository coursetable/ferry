            "\u00a0Some of the preconceptions I had about this period before taking this class were turned upside down. I learned so much about how imperative this period was in laying down the foundation for the centuries to come and how many changes occurred during this period. It was such a critical period despite being so long ago. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about the time period, social history, and the evolution of politics in England. It's a wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about the details in Early Modern England, mainly about social, political and economic changes, focusing domestically more os than internationally. You write to histology papers using sources and the final is two papers in 3 hours. ",
            "\u00a0The Course provided me with an interesting survey of knowledge of Early Modern England. I had previously taken a course on the British empire, this was more focused on domestic culture and politics so I came away with plenty of new information. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis skills, how to develop a cogent paper. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to use primary source documents to make historical arguments. I learned to focus on the experiences of the\" common people\" (the \"meaner sort\") in discussions changes that swept over England in the early modern period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the structures of power in Tudor and Stuart England, and how to think about historical change and continuities in general. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about 17th century England ",
            "\u00a0I gained good insight on how to do research with secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0The whole history of Early Modern England in every aspect - social, political, economic, you name it. Professor Wrightson has done a brilliant job turning this class into a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course on British history! The professor is very passionate about the subject. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was well thought out and the readings were relevant and carefully selected. I enjoyed that there were separate readings and discussion topics for each section, as it kept things more interesting and more than just an extension of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! There is a lot of material but it is all fascinating. The two essays are very helpful in preparing for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was that it was relatively easy to follow and learn the information but it was presented in a somewhat boring way. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the course was structured. It was a good syllabus, a reasonable amount of reading, not too much work, but I still felt that I could engage more with Professor Wrightson if I wanted to get more out of the course. It was very much a situation of you can get out what you put in. I think my only issue with the course was that maybe we didn't focus enough on issues of competing domestic ideas of political economy, I found that interesting in the Pincus class and would've loved to explore it more. However, we covered lots of great material so I can't really complain. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is a true expert on the subject and is more than willing to help with any questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting course material, enthusiastic professor, interesting art gallery visits\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could mix up lecture style from time to time ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is Professor Wrightson himself; his lectures spun a fascinating tale, even when the material (economic history) was not attention grabbing per se. However, most material was very interesting, and there's something for everyone (education, state building, literacy, etc.). I saw no real weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were well-structured and interesting! We were given a lot of freedom in choosing essay topics as well--which is definitely a plus. Sections were also very well-planned, and I always felt like I learned something new from sections--which is not what I can say about many other history sections:-P \r\nIn general Prof. Wrightson is a good lecturer and gives really good advice on essays. I always felt comfortable asking him questions in office hours and his list of suggested readings is gold--I'll keep it for life. ",
            "\u00a0Section was good and grading was fair. Class was tough to sit through. Just a single monotone sentence that dragged on for an hour ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the huge volume of information that is covered in a supremely interesting and digestible way. No weaknesses at all - the course is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are all online, but it's worth going to class! I wish that TA sections were larger in some section. Also, this semester there was a final exam and paper. There should only be a final paper OR exam, which was the case last year. ",
            "\u00a0This course is so well planned out, from the handouts to the Yale British Art Gallery trips. Professor Wrightson seems to have thought of everything. He keeps lectures engaging and fun, the narrative of history easy to follow yet also intriguing. He gives great insights and is full of so much knowledge. There is not a single weakness I can think of. "

            "\u00a0For anyone interested in European history, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a wonderful course. I had stumbled into it because I needed a preindustrial history credit for the history major, and I didn't think I was going to enjoy it. BUT it turned out to be my favorite course of the semester. The lectures are wonderfully woven stories, so make sure to pay attention. And the course is quite relaxed overall, so you can learn a lot without being too worried about workload. Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if you are interested in the subject material, it is easy to keep up with the work and doing all the readings is not necessary. However, if you are not interested in English history it will be very very boring. It is not graded harshly at all. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great 5th class or a \"toe in the water\" course for someone who isn't a History major. You get the elements of a history class (a final with essays, a research paper, interesting primary and secondary sources), but it's not too difficult. Professor Wrightson is really smart and is a legend (he smokes a pipe!) and has structured the class well. It's worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\nIt was an enjoyable class, with very wonderful quotes being shared without. Prof Wrightson makes the period very fun, with a characteristically dry humor. The topics are fairly interesting, and the overall workload is very straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Very interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would - interesting subject matter and not a brutal workload. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I learned so much, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to meet and interact with Professor Wrightson. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a history major or someone interested in English history and political thought. After all, the time period we covered was when important writers in European history lived and breathed: Milton, Hobbes, and Rousseau... The events that shaped England and Europe during this period have broad implications to the entire globe, and anyone who wants to better understand the formation of the English constitutional monarchy should study this period--because we still live with it every day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a good course for history majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, I think it was an interesting subject and the assignments and readings facilitated a good learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, if you have any interest in British history, take this course. Professor Wrightson is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Pleasant class to take, if you're interested in Early Modern England. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It is enjoyable and you learn some new everyday! "
