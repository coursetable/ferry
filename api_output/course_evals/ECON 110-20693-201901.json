            "\u00a0Nothing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about and analyzed the basic forces behind supply and demand in various economic situations. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about several basic concepts within microeconomics, including consumer behavior, supply and demand, production, monopolies and monopsonies, labor, and the efficient market hypothesis. We used some basic math throughout the course, had short regular psets, and had one midterm and a final. Since it's an introductory class, we generally talked about how things would work in very simplified cases. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how some mathematical/calculus-based skills can be applied in economics, and I learned how to carry out cost-benefit analysis in a variety of mathematical ways. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I developed a strong foundation in microeconomics. I learned thoroughly the basic economic concepts that constitute market economic theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that much of what individuals and groups do with money can be described and predicted quantitatively, and I learned some of how to do that description/prediction. I learned some life applicable principles, such as why it usually isn't worthwhile to create one's own stock portfolio. "

            "\u00a0Terrible class. Super boring material, saved only by a lovely professor. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the seminar style of teaching. It was also very helpful to learn microeconomics through a mathematical approach, because I was able to understand complex economic forces through relatively simple equations. ",
            "\u00a0I found it difficult to have only one midterm and a final, and for the grade to be so strongly skewed towards those two tests (each was 40% of the grade). The midterm came right in the middle of midterm season, and since I didn't feel like I had time to adequately prepare, I didn't do as well on the midterm as I would have liked and I ended up taking the course credit/D/fail. A lot of finals at Yale happen around the same time and it can be difficult to account for that, but I think it would help if there could be two midterms to break up the material and grade a bit more, or if the homeworks could count for a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0More interactive would help ",
            "\u00a0This was my first economics course, and I greatly enjoyed it! I think it progressed in topics very effectively, and set a great foundation for further analysis. However, I did take issue with some of the political topics brought up by the text/course material. The text would often make sweeping claims about issues such as welfare, housing/rent controls, the stock market, discrimination, etc that were purely based on the economics & math without full consideration of how such issues operate in the real world. I felt that sometimes only one political view would be represented/supported by the economics, and I would have liked to read other economists opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: slides are provided on Canvas; office hours were useful\r\nWeaknesses: although the class is a seminar, it's taught like a lecture ",
            "\u00a0The content flow of the course was great. Concepts worked well with each other and were solid foundational blocks for micro. One improvement that could be made is more connections between micro and macro, though I understand that they are different courses and there may not be time for that in micro. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the textbook is very clear and helpful. A weakness is that it's quite hard to stay on top of the material: it would have been nice if their were regular quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0This course could go slower on the material that is more quantitative and slower on the qualitative material. It would be more helpful to practice using formulas more in class and talking about the concepts that don't involve computations less. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0NOPE super boring, even a great teacher couldn't save the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course made me consider a major in economics. I think the subject matter is important to know and it is taught in a very understandable way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think I would. I took this course looking to gain some basic knowledge about economics and I think that it was useful to that end. Unfortunately there's really only so much that you can do and only so deep into the material that you can go in one intro course, so even though my econ knowledge still feels pretty limited, I think that I got what I expected from this course. The problem sets were always reasonable and pretty short--there were two weeks when the first years in the class thought that they were really long, but they were still the shortest psets I've ever seen at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would, because I feel that the amount of time and work required by the class translated very well to its intellectual gain. I learned a great deal in a short amount of time, and enjoyed it and plan to continue studying economics as a result. However, I would warn other students to be wary of some of the political topics addressed by the text (see my earlier comment). ",
            "\u00a0If they want to be an econ major, definitely. Otherwise, it's really up to you. I'd suggest credit/d/failing if you're not committed to econ as a major and only want to take the class to learn something for the sake of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. It was fine, but I didn't find it to be life-changing in a way that many other Yale courses are. If they were going to take Intro Micro, I would recommend taking it with Professor Simons. "
