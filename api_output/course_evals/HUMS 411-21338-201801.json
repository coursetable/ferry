            "\u00a0Knowledge on the vision of a good life put forth by various different traditions, and the language to articulate the nuance, difference, similarities, and attractiveness of different visions and your own. ",
            "\u00a0Life Worth Living got me to think about the values I lived by and be more aware not just of the times when my actions are not in line with these values, but also of the tensions that exist between my different values. I also got to understand different traditions at a deeper level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to question where my values come from, to step back and examine things that I've always taken as \"true.\" I've become a more considerate person and learned so much about traditions, both religious and secular, that other people follow. ",
            "\u00a0LWL was a life changing course, it made me more thoughtful and introspective about my own life and my own vision of the life worth living. It has made significant influence on my short-term and long-term future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think deeply about how I want to live my life and was able to come up with what I feel right now is my vision for a life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly so much. I cant say enough about life worth living as a course. It was an amazing class to take as a second semester senior, but more broadly I learned how to interact more genuinely with myself, my thoughts, other people and other belief systems. Cant recommend enough. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most insightful class I have taken at Yale. Not only to a have a deep understanding of a broad array of traditions, but I feel like I am truly able to articulate the way in which I aim to live my life. The class allows you interact with a wide variety of philosophical and religious ideas, all while exploring your own vision. I have never taken another class like this one, and I don't think there's another class that can accomplish what this one does. ",
            "\u00a0I took away many things from this course, and one of the most important was a handful of crucial questions that we all should ask ourselves instead of blindly trudging ahead. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal in this course. On the surface level, I learned a lot about the central beliefs and practices of some of the most important religious and philosophical traditions in the world today, and how these interact with each other and the similarities of the structures (but not always the contents) of these traditions. I also learned a lot about my peers and my instructor, and forged some relationships that I believe are really valuable. And I learned a lot about myself - simpler things like when I should speak up and (more importantly) when I should sit and listen. And I learned just a small bit about what I think is worth wanting in life; how to form and articulate my own beliefs and worldview. ",
            "\u00a0Having a framework for which to begin discussing the wide range of philosophies and traditions discussed in the course is applicable to everyone in one way or another - it is a starting point for which to disect the question, \"what is a life worth living\" when talking with anyone, regardless of whether or not they took the class. Having the language and structure for such a conversation is unique to this class and will serve anyone well in life interested in asking this question of themselves and of others. ",
            "\u00a0A terrific course! I learned how to think deeply about how I want to engage with the world in a more concrete way. I became more articulte about what I wanted out of life, not just vague formal terms such as \"helping people\" and \"being happy\". I also really improved my discussion skills and learned how to be more charitable with other traditions, but also to not lose sight of my own opinions. "

            "\u00a0More secular traditions. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a good job of helping us understand different traditions, and see why they make sense for large groups of people. The retreat was a highlight, and helped me get to know my classmates (and myself) better. I wish we had the chance to dive deeper into each tradition, but that is a limitation given the short amount of time we have. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about this class is amazing. Drew is a fantastic professor! He created such a comfortable classroom for everyone to share their view and stories. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the ability to engage in deep and meaningful conversations with people from a wide array of backgrounds. The readings were generally very well chosen, though a tradition as important as Hinduism should be added to the curriculum and Utilitarianism or Nietzche removed. The biggest drawback of the course was the grading of the essays - the topics were interesting but the word limit made it very hard to address all the areas of the prompt, so I often felt like I was writing them based on what the instructor was looking for rather than what I actually thought about the topic. Overall, the course was intellectually engaging and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0All the instructors are Christian and from the divinity school, putting some inherent and often subtle biases into the readings and the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing was I wished we had more time to focus on each individual tradition. In that respect I wish I had taken this class earlier in my Yale career because then I would have been able to build on the knowledge in future studies. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class all come from the bi-weekly seminars. Never have I felt so close to a group of students in an academic challenge. The discussions we had every week were interesting, meaningful, challenging, and insightful. I looked forward to my section every week, and it was one of the few seminars I actually dreaded coming to unprepared. The structure and design of the class allows each and every seminar to serve a purpose which I really appreciated. The class retreat was also an invaluable strength, as it really set the tone for the depth of insight this class would be able to reach. \r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this class comes from the assignments themselves. I think it would have made more sense to have reading responses due on the day of seminars, instead of the Sunday before. It also would have been very helpful to have seen examples of each paper before they were due. I had a very hard time figuring out what to write for each of these papers, and the expectations were very vague. While I thought they were valuable assignments, I think that some of the intrinsic value was stripped away because I was concerned about writing the \"right type\" of paper that would earn a good grade. I think this could have been avoided if we had seen examples of papers that accomplished the goal in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is the structure- the biweekly seminars and the weekly lecture- as well as the retreat. ",
            "\u00a0The course has many strengths, with enlightening readings, excellent professors, and engaging guest-lecturers. The greatest strength of the course, however, was the incredibly strong, encouraging, and tightly-knit community facilitated in the classroom. I felt as though I was learning along side friends, not fighting for an arbitrary grade or completing tedious work. I learned a great deal and made truly wonderful friends. The weaknesses of the course are few: I would have appreciated a seminar on Hinduism, as I am very interested in and ignorant about the tradition - however, I recognize that there are only so many weeks in the semester. And I think the class would benefit from a larger enrollment so that more students who apply could take the course, but I recognize that this is likely out of the control of the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very strong - I only wish we had more time to cover traditions that weren't so disproportionally Western. Buddhism and Islam are the two main exceptions to that, and I think covering more traditions from a broader range of backgrounds would be more reflective of how truly varied we are in the traditions we come from. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the amount of readings made it feel like taking a sip from a fire hose, but to a certain extent this is necessary to even get a rough understanding of such complicated and deep traditions. The strengths were the readings were always very interesting and the reading responses were fair and conducive to our overall understanding. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! This course does a great job of providing a space for people to do self-reflection on their values and how that manifests itself into a vision for what the life they want to lead looks like, and to do so alongside other students and authors from very different traditions/philosophical backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Life Worth Living was great in getting me to think about the values I lived by, and become more aware not just of the times when my actions are not in line with these values, but also of the tensions that exist between my different values. The retreat was a highlight, and brought me closer to my classmates, who were all thoughtful and open-minded. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you're a contemplative person who likes discussing life and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if the student is prepared for a challenge and is ready to be vulnerable with the class and the professors. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Cant recommend it enough. And if admin read this, give them all the funding in the world. It is class a like this that make Yale what it is. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Every single Yale student needs to take this class. While it wasn't the most academically stimulating, it gave me some of the best insight into my life at Yale, my past, and my future. I will be forever grateful for this class, and it's an experience that every single person should have. Every student will get something different out of this class - for some it will be life changing, for me it was life-validating. I feel so much more confident articulating the life I wish to live, and it makes waking up every day feel more purposeful. It is truly an experience I will never forget. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take it before you graduate if you can. You may not change your mind, but you will have a new set of tools to help you meaningfully engage with the world. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course - if only for the cultural awareness and articulacy, this course is worthwhile for anyone who hopes to engage with a diverse group of people. And the class does much more than that - it offers an opportunity to forge new friendships and address one of the most pertinent questions of our existence: what is worth wanting. However, while I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, I'd offer an important qualification: this is not the course that will solve the meaning of life. In fact, I am now less certain of my own worldview and life goals after taking this class - but I still found this class incredibly educational and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Academically: Having a framework for which to begin discussing the wide range of philosophies and traditions discussed in the course is applicable to everyone in one way or another - it is a starting point for which to disect the question, \"what is a life worth living\" when talking with anyone, regardless of whether or not they took the class. Having the language and structure for such a conversation is unique to this class and will serve anyone well in life interested in asking this question of themselves and of others.\r\n\r\nPersonally: I loved my class and my professor; the dynamic was really strong, and everyone was willing to have a discussion that was respectful but not afraid of being critical or asking hard questions of the material and each other. That is really unique to the professor and the class. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class! It doesn't happen for everyone, but for me, it helped revolutionize how I construct my values and what I prioritize. However, you have to go in being open to letting new ideas and traditions fill you up. If you walk into this class unwilling to not only question others, but yourself--you won't get a lot out of it.
