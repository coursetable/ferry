It showed me what research looks like as a career, real-world practices, common issues, etc. \r\n\r\nI built a great relationship with my PI, who also introduced me to other researchers at Yale who I would have never met if I had just taken another class. I also got to build actual research experience for my resume, which was super influential when I was job searching for post-grad life. ",

Moving forward, future projects with CSHHC may benefit from making sure that the necessary paperwork and forms are completed prior to starting the project. ",
