            "\u00a0Single Variable Calc! Pretty foundational math class. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered the basic concepts and fundamentals of Calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Quite broad understanding of limits, graphs, functions, and their rekations to derivatives and anti derivatives, along with the ability to apply this information in real world problems. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class gave a very process-based approach to calculus. Formulas were very rarely given off the bat- they were typically discovered through an in depth process that we did during class. In that sense I felt that my critical thinking was expanded, and I was able to make mathematical connections to areas of study outside of the Math department. I'm now able to think about rates of change in a variety of ways, and almost in a simpler manner. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to find limits, take derivatives, and integrate. Each topic encompassed a variety of methods and applications. Problem sets were challenging and allowed me to develop my critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of information for calculus this semester. I enjoyed the class and feel prepared to take Math 115 next semester. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I developed problem solving skills and the ability to use the tools i acquired to apply them to harder problems. ",
            "\u00a0I had previously learned nearly all of the information taught in this course, but I did learn how to manage my time in this class. I rather quickly came to the realization that PSETs are not meant for the night before! "

            "\u00a0It is a lot of work and can sometimes be confusing, but overall does a great job of teaching you the basics of calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's well taught; having us buy a special type of textbook with a special online package was ridiculous though, I really don't have $150 to spend on this. That being said, it was useful to have the online pre-class quizzes to keep me on track. So I do get the appeal, but having to spend over $100 is just too much... ",
            "\u00a0I think the grading in this course was very reasonable. The instructors gave us sufficient practice and resources to achieve the grade that we wanted. ",
            "\u00a0There is alot of work that becomes a bother for someone with a busy schedule ",
            "\u00a0The support the peer tutor schedule gives is huge. A negative is the scarcity of assessments, as a bad test can be huge in terms of an overall grade. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I felt like this class did the job as far as giving students a basic introduction into Calculus. It checked all the boxes (derivatives, integrals, approximations, etc) but it really let me down in that there was almost no student engagement. This type of class (which I essentially took in high school) can be more effective when students learn out loud and discover things out together. I understand that things need to move class in order for calculus 1 to be taught in a semester, but with it being taught as a lecture, I lost focus and got bored very easily. ",
            "\u00a0Very fast paced, it the students in the course all start at the same level (with little to no exposure to calculus) ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by providing more in class practice of skills as opposed to just lecture, but overall information was presented very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the problem sets that we have to complete each week in order to gain a stronger understanding of the material. Although we used webassign as well, sometimes I felt that using it was a weakness because entering the answers was confusing rather than helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have been more engaging during class time; the class period often felt long when there was so little discussion or interaction with the professor beyond just taking notes. However the content was intriguing and the notes always helpful, so I certainly got a lot out of my time spent in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that there is a very developed curriculum. The weakness of this course is that the curriculum makes it difficult when specific sections get a little behind, given that the homework is the same in all sections. ",
            "\u00a0The in class examples could have been more applicable to the problem sets and test problems but overrall my knowledge of calculus is greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty good at offering help to students struggling with Psets or WebAssign. The office hours are plentiful and helpful, but only if you know when and where they are. The Psets are graded very unclearly. My experience was that graders could just take off points for whatever they want. The tests were reasonable for the most part. ",

It will also be annoyingly difficult if you've taken AP AB Calculus before, but definitely take 112 and not 115 if you only took AB in high school. ",
