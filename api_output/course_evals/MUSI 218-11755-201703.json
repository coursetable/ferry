If it really is not involved enough to justify being a full credit course at this point it should be developed to deserve a full credit since it would take less work to get it there than to get it down to truly being a half credit course. Though cutting keyboard lab (the third meeting a week!!) would be a good start to making it a half credit course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the small size of the section really helped with the course overall. I felt like I had plenty of practice with everything before I was tested on it. The atmosphere of the smaller section was also more inviting and less stressful than it otherwise could have been. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a nice introductory course to aural skills. It is a great class especially if you want to take lessons. "

            "\u00a0A good course to take if you're a musician. I'm not a music major but the really basic skills taught in this class have gone a long way for me in some of my other music activities. Pretty low workload and Brian did a good job communicating his expectations and providing practice for everyone in a low-stress way. ",
