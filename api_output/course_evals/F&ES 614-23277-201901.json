            "\u00a0Learning about conceptual frameworks for environmental justice, as well as reading in depth on important case studies in environmental justice. We also learned the skill of self-reflection, learning how to apply what we read and learned in class to our own lives. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the core concepts of environmental justice, such as intersectionality, climate embodiment, and community organizing tactics. Professor Mendez invited several speakers to the class, and we had exposure to diverse environmental professionals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this class. It was probably my favorite class that I took during my time at F&ES. Partly because of the diverse and intersectional question-based curriculum which the professor so deftly put together, the opportunity to read his new environmental justice book, and the awesome syllabus of readings that helped us push our reflective practice. There was also the field trips, group activities, and the guest speakers that the professor curated, which helped us apply our reflective practice to our own growth, to our community context, and to bring the conversation beyond classroom theory. I gained a great deal from my time in the course and will use these insights in my career. ",
            "\u00a0This class really cemented my commitments to environmental justice but also made me humbler and more dynamic in my approach to EJ topics. I have a better sense of the connections between theory and practice as well and how I will engage with both in professional settings. ",
            "\u00a0A solid introduction to environmental justice ideologies and frameworks, and a new vocabulary on how to describe and identify injustices. ",
            "\u00a0Research, writing, critical thinking, being able to draw more ties between broader societal issues and the environmental movement (even though I would have previously said that this was something I had thought a lot about, this class really deepened my understanding) "

            "\u00a0This course was even better than I expected, even though I had heard great things. ",
            "\u00a0I expected this class to be more focused on professionalism but Im happy it was not. In fact, we had a discussion about the ways in which professionalism is often code for a range of systems of oppression and how it is incumbent upon us to both shed light on that and reinvent what it might be through the prism of equity. ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectations! ",

            "\u00a0The course is well-structured, and even though the sessions are long, Professor Mendez managed to keep things interesting my combining guest speakers, framing lectures, and class activities. The weekly tasks (which on some weeks are more than one) can get a little overwhelming sometimes, so I think that these assignments can be shortened slightly or reduced in number. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are 1) learning core concepts of environmental justice; 2) class discussions; 3) diverse activities; and 4) diverse speakers. I think the syllabus and class structure can be improved. It would be helpful to provide a timeline of the most important events in the environmental justice movement in the beginning of the course. Half of the readings were quite long, difficult, and sometimes repetitive. Additionally, sometimes there was too many activities for the class, and things felt rushed. The framing lectures should be shorter so that we had more time. I also wish there was more time to discuss our research papers. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this course was the environment that Professor Mendez nurtured in the classroom, and how hard he worked to get to know us. That helped to make people vulnerable and get our more introverted students an opportunity to open up a little more. The professor also was flexible with our needs, he gave us the time at the beginning of class to help us unpack all of the current justice issues constantly happening around Yale, particularly the issues with Yale Police, and student protests. In many classrooms, these issues, however relevant, would have been ignored. This class was different. The outside world was an integral part of our work, and we wrestled with current events at the local and global scale many times. ",
            "\u00a0I think a shorter class time with denser and more high level discussion would have been good. I liked the student presentations a lot. Discussion was good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the class' creative ability to include different typed of learning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the guest speakers, getting to read the professor's research, the other readings, and, I would say most importantly, the space the class provided for discussions that just don't happen in other classes or in environmental professions in general. I always really looked forward to this class!\r\n\r\nSometimes I felt like the guest speakers/readings/framing lecture didn't all tie together into the weekly the them that well (though they were always incredibly interesting). I wished that there would have been more discussion in class about the readings. I didn't get a lot from the role play---I probably wouldn't recommend doing it in the future. "

            "\u00a0I would make sure to talk to Dr. Mendez and be honest with your needs. He is a great listener and when we told him we wanted more of this type of readings or less of this type of discussion, he listened with humility and a real respect for students that is sadly pretty rare in academia. I would definitely take advantage of his office hours, and do your best to be an active part of the class and go on all of the field trips, it is a wonderful learning experience. ",
