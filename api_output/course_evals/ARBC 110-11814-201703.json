            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of many of the fundamental structures that make up the Arabic language. We learned the alphabet, different sentence structures, and we began to derive different verb forms. We also learned a lot of new vocabulary that allows us to infer the meaning of words with similar roots. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Al Ani is one of the sweetest professors I've had at Yale. She made sure everybody in the class was involved, and the in class activities were pretty fun and and enjoyable. She explains everything very clearly. I never felt lost and enjoyed even the final work in this class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the class is that students gain a strong foundation in Modern Standard Arabic. Unfortunately, the class places less of an emphasis on learning the Shami dialect. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organised and systematic. All the assignments helped me improve my language and vocabulary skills. I enjoyed the oral presentations immensely. I hope that we can interact with more Arabic speaking students in the future though. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Al-Ani is accessible and helpful. No in-class activity and homework assignment felt unnecessary as they all contributed to my learning of the language. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed taking ARBC 110 with Prof. Sarab. Our class moved a lot faster than the class with the other professor, and within weeks we had learned the alphabet, started to construct sentences, learned some basic rules of grammar and much more. Prof. Sarab also kept the class very engaging by holding a tour of the Beinecke, inviting students from the Arab Students Association to converse with us, and continually contextualizing whatever we learnt with appropriate pieces of news and pop-culture. You can tell that she cares a lot about her class, and by the end of the semester, our section came closer together, and it felt like a great little community.\r\n\r\nIts amazing that I learned so much in such a short space of time. The class picks up pace rapidly during the first four weeks, but then things slow down and the class focuses on reinforcing what youve already learned, which is comforting. More specifically, the class covers most of Alif Baa and then up to Chap. 6 of Al-Kitaab 1 (both books from Georgetown). \r\n\r\nTo do well in this class, I recommend attending regularly and keeping up with the homework. There is a lot of panic in the early days when you have to commit so much new material to memory, but it all works out in the end! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Al Ani makes Arabic tractable for everybody, and you will finish L1 amazed at how much you've learned. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic but very challenging - if you are not willing to put in 2-3 hours each night then you should not take this course. Professor Sarab was fantastic and I would recommend that anyone looking to take this course should take it with her (the other professors move much more slowly). ",
            "\u00a0Arabic is a tough language, but there could not be a better class than this to teach you! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Arabic. The course was very organised and this aspect allowed us to learn different concepts systematically. I enjoyed interacting in Arabic with my classmates and Professor Al Ani, even though my knowledge at this stage was limited. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! Arabic is a difficult language, but there is no better person to learn from then Professor Al Ani. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take it with Sarab if you can--she's amazing, linguistically very helpful, and also really really kind. "
