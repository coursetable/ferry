            "\u00a0I learned how to think and engage with my surrounding in a new way. I have developed critical thinking skills that I feel confident applying both in and outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Barraclough is an utterly brilliant person, and an amazing teacher. As an environmental studies major interested in questions of privilege, power, and access to public space, a critical geography lens was SO interesting and useful to me. The course combines philosophy, critical race theory, feminist/queer theory, Marxist theory, history, art/landscape, and so many other disciplines to provide a very well-rounded intellectual experience. Critical geography is a discipline that we are not exposed to at all in American education, but it is so useful and, I believe, critical to a proper understanding of how power and privilege work in this world. Because of this class, I am pursuing a concentration in geography. I believe it's a discipline that ties together much of what I've studied in the EVST department because I am going for a BA and love the social studies/humanities aspects of the environmental studies discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that every student would be required to take a human geography class. The critical thinking skills, combined with the philosophical theory produced such fruitful discussions. This course really taught be to think about our world, and particularly, how we organize our world, in ways I never had before. ",
            "\u00a0Space, Place and Landscape offers both a general introduction to geography and a deep analysis of one's own life. I learned a new way of thinking, but at the same time, I struggled to apply these new skills to my personal reflections. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me develop a spatial perspective when thinking about history and power in the world. I learned how to read landscapes and visual perspectives in critical ways, and even geographically deconstructed a place I call home to better understand  how and why it is the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible venue to think spatially about your own life's engagement with space, place, and landscape. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking about all of the spaces and places I inhabit and travel through. Valuable understandings of embodying and inhabiting places. Ways that the labels of space, place, and landscape can both disempower and empower certain populations. ",
            "\u00a0As a result of this course I have learned to look at geography and space in a way that no longer is limited to outlines on a map, and instead relates depth and the way humanity and power structures combine to form these borders and these places in order to form a new understanding. It is a relatively well-studied but not often discussed subject and way of thinking about the world, and it has changed both my understanding of self and societies. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class encourages you to think critically about every space around you and the social processes that have constructed it or take place there.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found this class to be very frustrating, as it takes as a given that everything around you MUST be a problem, and yet it does not encourage us to think about how to solve anything. ",
            "\u00a0The course was dynamic in that it utilized a lot of Yale resources and New Haven. I very much appreciated this. While the reading was very interesting, I had a difficult time drawing connections between theory and case studies we examined. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the conversations in the class were sometimes derailed and strayed too far from the topic at hand. I also felt like there wasn't a key takeaway from each class, since everyone just kind of offered their opinions on the readings. I think that it could be improved by Professor Barraclough taking a more structured approach to class, since it was never clear what we were supposed to get from the readings or from the class discussion. I did enjoy the field trip around New Haven. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an amazing introduction to the critical human geography discipline. The readings are diverse in scope and analytical lens, and I learned so much reading them. Prof Barraclough picked an amazingly diverse group of students for the seminar, and because the whole course is oriented around each of our individual home projects, I got close to my classmates in both an intellectual/academic and personal/emotional way. Professor Barraclough is an amazing seminar leader (I took her lecture class the prior year but I prefer her style in a seminar setting). The focus of the course around each individual student's relationship to their home is an amazing way to learn the material. I cared about doing all the work because it helped me understand my own identity better. Any class that is both intellectually rigorous and helps you do personal work is worth taking, and this class does both extremely well.\r\n\r\nI honestly can't identify any big weaknesses with the course. The syllabus is very comprehensive, and you can tell Prof Barraclough composed it with care. As long as you do the readings and feel engaged by the disciplinary lens of the course, I think any student will find it extremely gratifying. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings were interesting, Prof B is fantastic, papers were challenging but rewarding to plan and write, enriching to do out of classroom activities, group work \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think using case-studies in our discussions would have allowed for more focused discussion and analysis of the theory. I found that (and this tends to happen with theoretical discussions) a few of the times, participants in the seminar were discussing different things entirely, or unsure where the conversation was going. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong, and I have little to critique. The introductory portions of the seminar provide the baseline knowledge to inform the deeper discussions that develop throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the theory introduced throughout the course was wonderful and very informative. However, some of the topics and discussions that emerged during class seemed to become really repetitive about midway through the semester. A lot of the themes which we discussed at length with regards to space and place were very difficult to move beyond once we focused more on landscape in the second half of the semester. My favorite part of the class was definitely how interactive it was with New Haven, the YUAG, and the outside world in the form of each student's home. I loved how personal the class felt and how much capacity we each had to widen each others' perspectives by academically discussing our homes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaged learning that took the form of field trips and exiting the classroom. Small group discussions that were valuable to understanding and dissecting the materials. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are fascinating and very worthwhile, always. Most of the time seminar discussion was engaging and productive, as well. Only sometimes did it slip into the repetitive or the obvious. Professor Barraclough is incredibly encouraging and kind, but in those instances it almost became a negative because discussion would falter or lose its purpose. Aside from that, however, the course was really great! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class fosters very one-sided thinking that poses everything as a problem but never considers solutions. It became an environment where any contrary thoughts were stifled for fear saying the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nWhile I think it is important to think critically about the environments around us, I also think that that's the type of discussion that should allow for multiple viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0This class was not what I expected. The class discussions were not always on topic and Professor Barraclough did not make an effort to bring the conversation back to the readings. Mostly it was people talking about their personal experiences with place, which was interesting but not what I thought it would be. The readings were interesting, but sometimes difficult to understand, which was made even more difficult by the discussions in class. I would probably not recommend this to another student unless you enjoy this type of teaching and seminar style. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any student who is willing to work and who cares about doing emotional labor in an academic context. It will change the way you see the world, and it will also change the way you engage with academia in general. I could not recommend it more highly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! If you like to approach social/political issues from an interdisciplinary standpoint, if you're interested in urban studies, biopolitcs, or spatial theory, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. The assignments are as challenging as you make them, depending on your selected topic to explore for the duration of the course. In my experience, while difficult, the payoff was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you like to think spatially or to explore earnest conversations with good people about your own life and reckon with personal entry points to academia this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course! It gives you time, that other courses don't, to reflect on your life and how your home has shaped you. Also the only course at Yale I've taken that teaches about geography and interdisciplinary approaches to space, place, landscape. 10/10 would recommend. "
