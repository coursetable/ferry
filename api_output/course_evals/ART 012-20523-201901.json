            "\u00a0I learned how to use InDesign and some other softwares in the adobe suite fairly well. I learned how to collaborate and communicate. I learned a compilation of various perspectives who have taken part in activism. I also learned how to use the manuscripts and archives resource at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how advocates for social justice can use art to further a movement, promote a cause and garner participants. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think creatively and work with people on projects in a new way. I also learned to channel any emotions I had toward contemporary issues into action. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic principles of design. I also learned a few techniques that were necessary for my projects, but because many of them were very flexible and self-guided, most of the skills I acquired were specific to those projects and self-taught along the way rather than being taught to the broader class as a whole. I also learned a bit about the history of visual activism as well as contemporary examples, some being from currently practicing artists, activists, curators, or a combination of these aforementioned professions.

            "\u00a0Wish we could have had more time dedicated to technical skill development, learning software and tools, etc. in  addition to the rich art activist history ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the ability to use the work to speak to relevant issues. A weakness was a lack of cohesion that could tie all of the projects together in a way that would make the course feel more progressive and could help build upon and track developing skills. ",
            "\u00a0The flexibility of it was the course's strength and weakness. It was nice to be able to respond the the multitude of events that occurred this semester on campus, however the lack of structure of the course was also difficult to navigate, especially when trying to balance the time I was allocating for other classes and extra curricular work. Because of this it felt like it was a lot of work all at once.\r\n\r\nI think one weakness that might be applicable to other graphic design classes is the lack of access to the adobe suite on computers throughout campus. Having that on more computers  with the adobe suite (in residential colleges, for example) would eliminate a lot of logistical difficulties and treks to Green Hall.\r\n\r\nOne strength was our TA, Liyan. She was incredibly helpful with the nitty gritty details of InDesign that we wouldn't have enough time to go over in class. ",
            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed this course and our many in class discussions felt like a strong way to assess our current political climate and understand the role of art in the political sphere. Some assignments required a bit more clarification, however because of our TA and the community fostered in the classroom it felt as though we all had resources for help if needed. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting to have guest lecturers and learn in different ways. I also learned to use Yales library resources more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course come primarily from its interdisciplinary and active approach to teaching as well as the professor's decision to call upon her expansive network of artists and activists whose work was reflective of the theoretical material learned through assigned readings. The strong focus on practice over theory was also a plus, as activism requires action and engagement with one's surroundings, and theory often cannot encapsulate the extemporaneous quality of work that is demanded by current issues that call for direct action and of activist work as a whole. Technical feedback on visual and design components was also really strong and straightforward.\r\nThat being said, this class could use a slightly more structured approach particularly because it is a first-year seminar. Were it a higher-level course geared towards students who have a pre-existing involvement with activism, the looseness of the curriculum would be of little issue. However, because many first-years are not as adjusted to or knowledgeable about the issues of the local community and the University (although it's very important for them to get started), it's hard to narrow down issues of interest and be able to pin them down with enough conviction and purpose to create something that feels worthwhile, impactful, and most importantly, relevant and useful for the greater good at the time of creation. Because of that, our work at times felt contrived and imposter-like. Having a stronger and more structured foundation on current issues in the community rather than historical examples of art/activism or theory would be much more helpful in developing that confidence to do the work required of the class. Building a stronger connection between the students and the issues at hand is really important because without that personal connection to the subject matter, it feels like we're doing something that's outside of our positionality and capacity. \r\nCommunication was also an issue, just because most of the time we didn't know what exactly our assignments were, either because language was unclear or because the assignment was simply sent out late, leaving us only a few days to get something done that would require much more time to polish. Occasionally, readings and files wouldn't attach properly either and we were uncertain whether it was an issue with our own emails, Canvas, or any other technical difficulty so that made it harder to ask and figure out the problem.

            "\u00a0This is wonderful if you're considering art or are just interested in activism in general ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be better after it has been running for longer and is more organized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. While some of the class meetings could drag on, the guest lectures were usually interesting and the assignment prompts were flexible. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it was advertised more accurately initially. The course was fun because no one was sure which way it would lead, but I was completely unaware of how much graphic design background the professor would expect us to know. It felt like we should have taken an intro art class prior to this first year seminar, despite the majority of the class being non-art majors. Although initially we were told that our art \"technically speaking\" would not determine our evaluation of the project, towards the end of the semester I felt as though it was heavily based on artistic techniques I did not have background with. This class was not advertised as a graphic design class, but leaned heavily on it. Going forward, it would be good to mention the strong graphic design approach for people shopping the class.\r\n\r\nI would recommend the course because of the speakers in particular. We got to hear and learn from various speakers, however I wish that there was an order to the speakers we heard or it corresponded to the syllabus given at the beginning of the semester.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend this class because of its goal and mission. I am very grateful for the people I met through this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course as it taught me that art like any other subject has its challenges, and you need to take time and care in refining all your pieces, however the work is often more enjoyable than finishing a problem set or creating a bibliography, and thus serves as a welcome study break. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it was very different from any other courses Ive taken here. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would, but not to a first-year student for the same reasons mentioned in #3. "
