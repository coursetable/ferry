            "\u00a0This was my first introduction to urban planning so I learned a lot from the course. Understanding the history and foundations of urban planning and then various trends and topics of focus in the field was enlightening. I also really enjoyed how David allowed us to focus on our own interests through the assignments so we could apply these lessons to areas that we were interested in. ",

            "\u00a0Basic understanding of urban planning practices, often at a much more nitty-gritty level than expected. Major takeaways were transit oriented development and density as a key to sustainable urbanization. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview into urban planning! It allowed students to learn a wide range of critical planning components form the differences in regional and subregional planning to zoning and finance. I found Mr. Kooris to be a really effective teach and also found the course to be designed very well. ",

            "\u00a0This course was more valuable to me than any of the other courses I have taken at the Architecture School. It exposed me to readings, theories and ideas I haven't encountered before and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It should be a part of the Architecture school. ",

Some of the readings felt a little out-dated, and might benefit by being replaced by a more contemporary equivalent. \r\n\r\nI liked the group assignment where we researched a community for the semester. For this assignment (and the others), I think there could be slightly better guidance about expectations. \r\n\r\nReally enjoyed both field trips - great way to gain real-world insights into how urban planning decision-making is done, and when there are good/bad outcomes from it. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength and weakness is Professor Kooris focus on his own experience. He has a lot to offer and generally began class with a discussion on planning situations from the past week. While this is valuable, at times he spent too much of the class (roughly an hour) on this type of lecture. It would be helpful if he aligned his lectures more closely with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were super interesting, assignments were rewarding. There were a lot of readings - too many to reasonably do all of them every week. Also could have used more guidance on the projects, as expectations were often vague. ",

I also enjoyed the two field trips that our class took. I didn't really think that the course had too many weaknesses though it would have been nice to get more feedback on our assigned. In particular, our group planning assignments. ",

Mr. Kooris is a wonderful teacher and is a great lecturer! ",
