            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the beginning stages of designing a study, including doing background research and thinking about study design. ",
            "\u00a0Working in a psych lab during my time at Yale was a huge opportunity for work experience and developing practical skills in psychological research. The CANDLab was such a warm and inviting place to do this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a study in psychology. I learned about conscious and non-conscious perception and learning. I learned about working with a team, problem-solving, and staying calm under pressure. I learned about critiquing and learning from other studies. ",

            "\u00a0Throughout the semester, I developed both my wet lab and data analysis skills. I also learned a lot about other research in the field, especially through a review that I wrote on existing findings. ",

            "\u00a0The directed research program is what you make of it. The independent study structure works really well when you have a clear project on which you will work. In this course, one can learn skills and knowledge that most other courses offered at Yale don't teach. However, at times, my project did not progress as planned, and so I had to adjust my original vision. This change is not necessarily a bad thing; one just has to understand that research can be unpredictable, and they must be ready to adapt. ",

            "\u00a0I think a good deal of thought needs to go into how to improve this course. On the one hand, the opportunity to do research is unbelievably valuable and something that I think all students should do at some point. That said, the expectations for the course need to be reconsidered. Turning in 15 pages of writing for a P/F course doesn't make much sense, especially since a thesis is 20 pages. This amount of writing would be entirely reasonable if you were given lab time to write, but in most cases, you are not.  As a result, you end up spending far more than the already significant number of scheduled hours doing additional work.\r\n\r\nIt's fantastic that this course is offered, but it would be a much stronger option if there were clearer expectations as to what students are doing during their scheduled lab hours. ",
            "\u00a0Truly depends on the lab and project you're working on. If it's something that interests you, I think this is one of the best courses you can take because you get real experience working in a lab (especially if you're considering grad school). ",
            "\u00a0If you have a clear project in mind, then yes. Otherwise, really think about what you hope to get out of it. It definitely is not for everyone, as the project and design comes from you, so really consider if it is something that you want and will be able to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend PSYC 493 to another student because it provided me with a unique opportunity to develop a relationship with a graduate student and psychology professor and gave me a better understanding of what I'm interested in pursuing after my undergraduate years.
