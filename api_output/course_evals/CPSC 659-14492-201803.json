            "\u00a0This was a great course to audit. State estimation and decision making. ",
            "\u00a0Learning Robot operating system (ROS) pretty well. Reinforcing my python coding skills. Learning how to use openCV and a number of other useful robotics-related packages. Ascertaining the current state of a wide-variety of robotics-related disciplines, including user interfaces and human robot interaction. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of practical computer vision, ROS (Robot Operating System), sensors for perception, kalman filtering, deep learning applications. Really extremely useful stuff for robotics and computer vision. You'll also learn how to read and analyze research papers, since the class covers a lot of cutting edge technology through paper presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Many different algorithms to teach a computer to interact with humans. ROS (Robot Operating System). ",
            "\u00a0I actually learned about perception and decision making. I also learned how to read and critique computer science papers in HCI and AI which was really valuable. Before this class, I had never done that. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about the cutting edge of computer vision and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on applications in robotics. This class is incredible. One of our best professors teaching one of our most interesting classes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the basics of human-computer interaction and its design, and current research in the area. The second part of the course also had a significant focus on Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning techniques. The problem sets were a great introduction to ROS and some basic concepts in planning and control. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about HCI through the papers that we read, I developed my presentation skills through the class presentations that we gave, and I strengthened by robotics skills through the homework and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about cutting edge developments in deep learning, robots, and human computer interaction. Experience practical applications with writing convolutional neural networks, computer vision algorithms, and robotic controls. Learned a lot about the future of self-driving and other hot topics. ",
            "\u00a0Became more comfortable in using TensorFlow. Learned about computer vision, various aspects of machine learning, its current applications and limitations. ",
            "\u00a0Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?/ Tracking a red sight, no escape from reality/ Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see/I'm just a robot, I need OpenCV / ROS and Python code, Python code, little bugs, little slow/Robust Kalman filters just really matter to me... to me/ Deep learning!

            "\u00a0Course was taught well.  A few too many student presentations though. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: excellent homework which taught me a substantial amount about ROS, filtering, and machine learning. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: presentations in class, as led by students, can get a little boring if they're back to back in a week. ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture was extremely organized, and it was clear Marynel put a lot of effort into her slides. The material is very interesting and Marynel explains it very well, stopping to clarify confusing parts often. The papers presented in class coincide with material we learn from her lectures. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Marynel cares so much! We receive many useful feedbacks from her, and because of that, we had lots of fun working on our final project, which is an interactive system of our choice. Most papers chosen for the class were very interesting, but some of them were a bit dry. Regardless, Marynel's lectures are always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Vazquez is AMAZING. I cannot think of a better professor in the CS department. She makes the course awesome. Her lectures make sense, she cares about you understanding the material, it's all good things. The project at the end of the class didn't feel like another hoop to jump through. I learned so so so much through the project and the rest of the problem sets. The class being capped at 20 something people is also great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, none. Maybe if we could receive interim feedback for our paper presentations? ",
            "\u00a0Best course I've taken in the computer science department! ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, so I wouldn't really change anything about it. Marynel is awesome at explaining new concepts and then ramping up very quickly. I really liked the way in which each paper we discussed had 2 sets of presentations- one to explain the paper, and one to critique it. More graduate classes at Yale should adopt this format. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a nice mix of fundamental and cutting-edge developments in perception and machine learning ",
            "\u00a0I thought that breaking the material into sensing and decision making was a good idea. I also liked learning about ML stuff, and specifically Neural Nets. I thought that the homeworks were really good for learning the material, and it was nice how they walked you through the problems a little bit to help you learn the material as you went along. I felt that some of the papers selected were definitely more seminal and interesting than others. I also think that having maybe one or two more homeworks would have been nice because they were so helpful for learning the material. I found the neural net homework to be pretty challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Marynel is a spectacular professor -- she added so much value to the class. Her explanations were very clear and I learned a lot from lecture. In particular, the final project was a great time. It was one of the only projects I've done at Yale that I actually enjoyed working on. And of course, the AlphaGo movie night was really great too :)\r\n\r\nMy only small suggestion for improvement is that a couple of the problem sets felt tedious because it was unclear what the \"correct\" behavior was supposed to look like, or whether my conceptual understanding of what was being asked was correct. So, I'd sometimes try a complicated approach when really the solution was much simpler. ",
            "\u00a0Deep learning and artificial intelligence are topics that are easy to hype up, but Marynel piggybacks off our pre-existing interests in the field to compel us to look beyond the buzzwords and captivating applications and to think more critically about the limitations and implications these technologies.  This course was not the first time I've encountered some hot topics, like neural networks, reinforcement learning, and perception, but this class is truly one of the first times I've really felt like I've understood these complicated and quickly evolving technologies on a more fundamental level. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging students in reading papers and presenting them\r\nWeakness: the steps in the homework assignments felt too guided and streamlined to cover many topics ",
            "\u00a0I think the course strikes a balance between many different kinds of learning. You've got lectures that go over the idea of deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and approaches that people take in training robots. You've got lectures about sensors, about geometry, and about the mathematics of tracking uncertainty. But you also have hands-on assignments, which are very well structured and don't take that much time. You also read papers and critique them, and work on a substantive final project. and it's very fun!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Paper readings covers a lot of topics. Assignments are well organized and teaches how to use ROS.\r\n\r\nHow to improve: sometimes I am lost reading a paper whose topic I am not familiar with. maybe provide a little more context and related materials for the papers. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Great course for an introduction to decision making in robotics. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in robotics, computer-human interaction, graphics, user interfaces, etc. \r\nYou should have a decent knowledge of coding. Familiarity with ROS will help, but is not required. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best CS electives at Yale, with one of the best professors. The workload is pretty high, probably comparable to CS323, but you learn a lot from doing the psets which are extremely well designed. If you want to learn about computer vision and robotics, you HAVE to take this course. I can't overstate how good it is - it sets an example for what CS courses at Yale should be. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This is definitely one of the best CS electives at Yale. Even if you're not doing the BS/MS program, I'd still recommend taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes, yes 100% yes. This is THE best CS class I've taken in my four years here. Take this class, or any class taught by Prof. Vazquez if you want to learn, and for it to not be painful. I took NLP and the ML for Bio class, and only in BIM did I finally understand stuff like LSTM and imitation learning and everything taught in NLP. The project at the end is also really fun, and it's overall a nice setup for a class, with some problem sets, a project, and paper presentations. I learned how to read CS papers and critique them, which is something that's not taught in every class. Prof. Vazquez knows a LOT about her field, and it really shows in how she teaches the class--she brings in outside knowledge which is super cool. She also stops to make sure we understand stuff, which is such a plus. I've never had a CS professor do that. Highly recommend this course if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Hands down one of the best CS classes you can take at Yale, and this is coming from a senior who has unfortunately had to sit through too many classes with poor lectures and badly designed problem sets. Although it was only a small part of the course, the lectures introducing deep learning were way clearer than any other class I've taken that has attempted to do so. Marynel is also very smart and clearly knows a lot about the field, and really cared about what feedback students had on the material being covered. We even had a class movie night where we watched the AlphaGo movie, so the class really got to bond over these experiences. The amount of time you want to invest in the class really depends on you, since you'll be working on your final project for a significant portion of it. If the class is offered again, PLEASE take it. I'd even recommend taking any class Marynel is teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in robotics or HCI. I think that the course taught me a lot about both, without being overwhelming or consuming a massive amount of my time. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Marynel is *such* an amazing professor; it's worth taking this class just to have her as a teacher. She's incredibly smart while still being compassionate and approachable. Her explanations of complex subjects are crystal clear, and she's never afraid to slow down lecture or a presentation to make sure everybody is following. She understands what it's like to be an undergrad in a way that many other professors in the CS department don't, and her dedication to teaching inspired all of us students to be our best selves. Marynel is certainly the strongest CS professor I've had at Yale, and I really hope many other generations of undergrads get to experience her magnificent teaching.\r\n\r\nThe course material is also interesting. It covers a pretty broad spectrum of topics from computer vision, to robotics, to ML, to AI. The final projects for the class were really fun to put together and the student presentations were a blast to watch. The class does involve a lot of paper reading, and if you're looking to improve at paper writing this is a good class to consider. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this class. Best course in the computer science major. The paper presentations are actually really engaging to listen to and preparing a critique or presentation is actually both challenging and fun. The problem sets are super solid; Marynel sets you up to do incredible work with writing neural nets and controlling a robot. This class is the best way to get practical knowledge about all the hot topics in computer science (deep learning, computer vision, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I think the course strikes a balance between many different kinds of learning. You've got lectures that go over the idea of deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and approaches that people take in training robots.
