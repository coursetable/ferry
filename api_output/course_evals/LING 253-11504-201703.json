            "\u00a0Syntax I has taught me to think as a puzzle-solver.  We took a wide range of languages and figured out how to think critically about the structure of those languages in order to make a model that would capture the similarities and differences between languages.  I now know a significant amount about language structures but more importantly, I developed the skills to figure out those structures on my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic syntax concepts and theories: x-bar, binding, wh-movement, head movement, just to name a few. After taking the class, I become more aware of the great similarity between human languages. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about syntax, which I think is a truly fascinating subject, and in the process was forced to think critically about my own mental grammmar and the ways in which I myself parse the English language. Meta and awesome! ",
            "\u00a0Good knowledge of Generative Grammar. Raffaela is very good ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the *process* of syntax--the methodologies of determining the relationships between words and phrases in a given language, though with a focus on English mostly. I couldn't necessarily explain how English works, but I'm definitely better at linguistic reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0Deep working understanding of the questions syntax tries to answer and how we go about using syntactic theory to answer those questions ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the syntax of language ",
            "\u00a0Very through survey of syntactic theory and the empirical motivations for it ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about phrase structure in an analytical way. ",
            "\u00a0Syntax is one of the central subfields of formal linguistics (and a requirement of the Linguistics major), so I'm very happy that I learned a lot out of this class. Syntactic analysis isn't always easy or intuitive, but I have a good grasp of the core concepts and the methodology. I know the structure -  apparent and hidden of language (mostly from English data), constituency, movements, and case assignment, among other things. The analytical skills I developed from this class is astounding. And even though there were challenges here and there, in the end, I feel like I'm much more prepared to tackle more formal linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of modern syntactic theory. I improved my ability to use scientific reasoning to test ideas about sentence structure. The course also made me more aware of the wonders of the human language ability. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The inquisitive approach we took toward learning the material was invaluable for developing our ability to reason on our own.  The p-sets were engaging and took us through a set of steps to reach a conclusion.  The only improvement that could be made would be to include even more non-English data. ",
            "\u00a0No weakness. This is the best lecture class I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Zanuttini made the classroom absolutely engaging and the whole class, at the end of the course, feel like a big family. ",
            "\u00a0A really intriguing class with interesting assignments. I can't suggest any improvements (except maybe case studies from languages that are further afield)! ",
            "\u00a0Professor and TA are understanding and always helpful, lecture was well taught and professor always helped students to understand the material thoroughly. Professor Zanuttini created a very comfortable environment in class that allowed students to ask questions and learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0On the whole, a great course. The problem sets were interesting and the right amount of challenging. Only thing I'd address is consistency in the models. For instance, stopped assuming all phrases have specifiers at some point in the semester without any explicit announcement and I don't really recall people getting a clear answer as to why. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-paced, covers broad material\r\nWeaknesses: there was sometimes crucial information covered in section that was not in lecture while lecture sometimes spent a little too much time on review ",
            "\u00a0This course was great, and the psets focused on things learned in class, in section, and in the book. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the material and p-sets. I think the beginning of the course could have moved more quickly ",
            "\u00a0The section was helpful, and the professor and TF were open to questions. It was clear that they really cared about teaching us. Weaknesses were just uncertainty in what we were learning; the lecture deviated from the textbook, and it would have been nice to have a PDF or some kind of reliable reference that followed the lecture. We got a study guide before one of the exams that showed examples of different trees exactly as we drew them in class, and that was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great due to the small class size and the level of engagement of both the professor and the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the class is very well-structured and the concepts flow every well together. The P-sets are super relevant and helpful in checking if I get the concepts taught. Midterms and final are very neatly written and fairly graded.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sections are kinda empty ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized to facilitate learning. The content covered by the course was flexible but structured enough to keep everyone interested and challenged throughout the semester. The homework assignments are practical and help review and expand on the topics covered in class. Section was helpful both to review material and to expand on certain topics. Overall, the course does an excellent job of presenting interesting and important information from the field of syntax to both linguistics majors and non-majors. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take Syntax. It will help develop an analytic way of thinking that will be useful in practically all other coursework.  It also happens to be a fascinating subject that doesnt get the kind of publicity it deserves. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, even to non-linguistics majors who are interested in languages. This class is structured so well that we eased into every complicated concept. If you are interested in languages, syntax, or even just grammar, this class will definitely provide you with fresh perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in universal grammar/ just wants to learn about the building blocks of language! Problem sets were a really great intellectual exercise. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. You have to if you're LING. You should if you're CS/COGSCI/MATH/PHIL ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would for anyone interested in the mechanics of language ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend, if you haven't taken a linguistics course before, you have to work a bit harder, but it is very worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Seems pretty essential for anyone doing linguistics ",
            "\u00a0If you are in any way interested in grammar or the structure of languages (not limited to just English), definitely take or at least shop this class!! Raffaella is an amazingly caring professor, and Sean (the TA this semester) was extremely helpful and engaging. You learn a ton about how to structure sentences, which mainly involves drawing tree structures, and it really makes you appreciate how complex language is. I'm not a linguistics major, but this class doesn't actually require any prior knowledge about linguistics, despite what the prereqs say. The problem sets really prepare you for the exams, and were actually pretty fun to do. Again, take this class if you are at all interested in the topic! ",
            "\u00a0If you're a Linguistics major then you have to take it. I took it after intro Ling and found it manageable. Don't worry if you haven't done intro Ling, though. You can use the first few weeks to do some catch-up reading. If you're in Cognitive Science or Psychology, you may also find this class super relevant and interesting. And if you have no idea what Syntax is or just a very surface knowledge of linguistics, and don't even know if you like this kind of stuff, then you may want to try Ling 110 or 106 first. This class is definitely challenging even for some Linguistics majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who thinks they might be interested in linguistics, especially if they are coming from a more STEM-based background and enjoy using structured, clear reasoning to learn and make arguments. The topic of the course is interesting and presented in a way that is engaging even for seasoned linguistics majors yet accessible to non-majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a low workload class. I spent a lot in class, attending section, and completing the weekly homework assignments. It is especially difficult for non-majors "
