            "\u00a0My ability to read longer passages of latin and understand them in a more general sense was cultivated by the length of the assignments for this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a bit more depth to the Aeneid AP curriculum in terms of plot and thematic discussions rather than just translation questions. It was also helpful to refresh the work before the Comps (necessary Latin major exam) ",
            "\u00a0I developed not only a far stronger understanding of specific grammar constructions, but also learned how to analyze Latin literature from a thematic and syntactical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about Virgil's Aeneid from new angles, reading not only for the connections that the text itself suggests, but also looking beyond the poem to find connections with historical context, other literary works, and secondary scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0My Latin translation skills vastly improved during this course. I learned how to not just use the first definition of a word I found in the dictionary but actually find different, less used definitions to enhance my translations. \r\nThis course also opened up the Aeneid for me, literarily. I began to understand some of the greater themes of the amazing Roman epic (also one of my favorite books of all time), and I saw how Virgil weaved his tale through precise language as well as through general structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to translate Latin poetry more than just literally, and how to take into account historical context and read the Aeneid in a way that is deeper than what is on the page. ",
            "\u00a0I loved learning about the Aeneid! ",
            "\u00a0Translation, discussion of Latin. ",
            "\u00a0I refined my Latin skills tremendously in this class. It was a huge step up in intensity after high school Latin, and I feel like I improved both my ability to translate and to analyze the Aeneid. In the beginning of the semester, I felt almost overwhelmed by the amount of translating I had to do, but by the end, I had improved a ton and could translate more easily. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I learned so much about the Aeneid from this course. Professor Freudenburg told us so many fascinating insights and observations about the epic. I also learned so much from my peers in the class. It was a great challenge for me to be around older, more experienced students, and I learned very much from their insights. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to developing my Latin translation skills, I learned how to better read between the lines of poetry using grammar, syntax, etc. to form cohesive arguments and opinions about the text. Daily interactions involved gleaning as much information as possible from one grammatical decision on the author's part, a skill demanded in courses beyond language or literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Aeneid and its significance in its own context. ",
            "\u00a0introduction to various topics in scholarship on the Aeneid, as well as innovative close reading of passages both well-known and obscure. "

            "\u00a0This course engages with really great Latin, but often too much to cover during 2 75 minute classes per week. Since the class was so large this semester, having discussion sections could facilitate more participation for each student and offer more time to get through all of the latin. ",
            "\u00a0There were just too many people, and (dare I say) too many first years. For many, it seemed like a chance to show off their Directed Studies knowledge about Homer, even though this was nominally a Latin class. I really think my engagement with the material and overall feeling of the class would have been significantly higher and better if it had been capped at 15. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well designed, evaluating its students on a pretty regular basis and supplementing Latin reading with useful and interesting secondary articles. Its only flaw was that it ended up with a much larger class-size than the one for which it was designed, so it had to be run with less participation on the part of each individual student than might have been ideal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- It was a translation class, and I learned how to translate better than I had in the past. \r\n- It was a great seminar course with an amazing professor, whose knowledge is absolutely incredible and who is an incredible person to get to know as well. Take this class if you really love Latin or the Aeneid. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- I was doing Directed Studies with this course, and I hit the wall in terms of work. This course takes a lot of time and energy, especially if you've never taken a Yale language course before. We would be responsible for about 800-1000 lines per quiz, and there were five quizzes in the semester. \r\n- There were more than 25 people in this course, and so it was a little bit hard for everyone to get a chance to translate. That said, the level of engagement amongst those people was very high for a class of over 25. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that this class was more than just pure translation. We talked a lot about history and the overall meaning in the Aeneid, so a strength of this course is that it seemed interdisciplinary and was not only translation. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Loved the classroom dynamic (Freudenburg is amazing), and all of the readings were really interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Secondary readings were often not engaging ",
            "\u00a0My favorite part of the class was that Professor Freudenburg knew so much about the Aeneid. I was always very engaged and interested in everything he had to say. Another strength was the challenge of the course. For me, I had to spend a lot of time on the translation each night, and as a result my Latin really improved. Sometimes, though I wished we had spent more time on the most complicated grammar of a passage. When we translated in class, we would just start at the beginning of the passage and review whatever we reached, and we sometimes missed the hardest grammatical points. Perhaps we could have just jumped ahead to review those before continuing in the normal way. Overall, though, I loved this course and learned so much from it. ",
            "\u00a0Class size was the major draw back of the course since it limited both the ability of students to continuously participate in class, especially students who are not as confident in their ability as others, and it caused the final research project to be substituted for a final test. While the option to still write a paper was left open, it would have been a much different and better class experience to work with the professor on a full research project. ",
            "\u00a0The class had a large volume of work, but it helped me improve my Latin reading and analytical abilities. I wish the class had been smaller, as I feel like that would have facilitated better learning. ",
            "\u00a0I wish Prof Freudenberg had capped the class at, say, 18, and kept the format of a seminar. With about 25-30 people, the class was somewhere in between a lecture and a seminar, and discussion rarely happened between students. We rarely could finish translating the assigned passage, as there were so many questions--perhaps we could have set aside time for questions after translating. "

            "\u00a0It's a great way to cover key material for any Classic major or student with interests in comparative literature. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great latin course for someone who has just reached the L5 level, or for first years taking their first latin course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This is a hard one. Freudenburg is a gem, and up until this class I would have recommended literally anything with his name on it. However, I had a fairly awful time in the class, more due to its size than anything the professor could have done. Definitely shop it if it is offered again and hope that more people will drop it than did my year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this and other classes taught by Professor Freudenburg to other students. I thought the course suffered slightly from its size (25 students is honestly too many for an upper-level Latin course), but was well-conceived and executed. Professor Freudenburg makes the material interesting and accessible to all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was highly interesting and also provided a strong technical foundation in Latin ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to learn how the \"little things\" (i.e. grammar, word choice, metrics) add up to \"big things\" and seeking to understand the vision of Vergil in a new way. This course taught me so much about Vergil's manner of writing and how to unpack the Latin to find essence and meaning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is a wonderful way for a nonmajor to deepen her understanding of the late Roman republic through literature or for a Classics major to gain a solid grounding in the current world of Virgil scholarship. Also, it's interesting and well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0If you have enough time and energy to take this, I would strongly recommend the course. At its worse the class was interesting; at its best, it was thrilling. I have a vastly improved knowledge of the Aeneid compared to when I did in the beginning of the year, and I have learned themes about the book here that I can apply to real life. Professor Freudenburg knows an insane amount about the Aeneid and currently is doing research on it. And he's a really nice person to know. However, if you want to take this class, but you think you won't have that much time to do so, don't. The class needs a lot of time and energy to do properly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! This was a very fun Latin class and any classics student would love it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if you have any interest in Latin! If Freudenburg is teaching it, then you should definitely take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if that student wants to seriously pursue the classics ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  The material was interesting and Professor Freudenburg's teaching style is very engaging and effective. ",
            "\u00a0If you really like the Aeneid and are prepared to do 150-200 lines of translation per weekthe material is interesting, but at times it felt like a slog. "
