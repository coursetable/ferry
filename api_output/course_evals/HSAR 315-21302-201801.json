            "\u00a0I thought that this was an amazing class on the 19th century French art, and really broadened my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I further honed my analytical skills, memorization skills, and thematic skills as I was able to see the bigger picture amongst the different time periods we went through. ",
            "\u00a0WOW loved this class for teaching me how to write an art history paper (I'm a history major) and knowing Impressionism on a deeper level! ",
            "\u00a0A background knowledge in french art ",
            "\u00a0How to look at an object closely, and think critically about what it says about the time in which it was made and the person who made it. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of French art from around the sixteenth century and up to the twentieth century. The background information was very interesting at the beginning of the course to learn about in order to see how the art developed over the centuries. "

            "\u00a0It is definitely a hard course, with around 500 images on the final. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by minimizing the amount of memorization for the midterm and final, and refining a list of paintings that are most important. With so many paintings and dates to memorize, sometimes the bigger themes get lost in the picture as you are focusing on the minute details. ",
            "\u00a0It is poorly organized by the professor. I felt like the evaluation aspect of the course did not engage with what we were actually learning in class. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures and sections worked well to provide different learning experiences. Perhaps the pacing could be better, so we aren't rushing to finish at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and sections were great. I think that the lectures could get a little dry at times which made it difficult to fully engage sometimes. The handouts which Professor Armstrong provided were very helpful for studying, but I wish that the titles and dates would have also been on the powerpoints as well. "

            "\u00a0I loved this class and was so engaged, so I would definitely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend! It is an intellectually stimulating class which not only takes you through the culture of 19th century France, but through the history! ",
            "\u00a0YES. It's challenging to do well on the exams because you need to memorize dates, artists, and works. And you won't always be tested on the most significant works. I may recommend that you take the class Credit/D/Fail if you are not an Art History major AND you do not know much about France or French art. I'm a history major and would have done well if I'd taken it on a letter grade scale. It's just sort of up to you and how much work you feel able to put into the course over the semester. If you take it Credit/D, this is SMOOTH SAILING and you will obtain tons of good cocktail party knowledge AND become more culturally aware. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Also, Professor Armstrong is an expert in the Impressionist field. There really isn't a better professor for this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course taught by another professor. The course is great but the professor does not facilitate learning well ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in this period of art, they will love this class. ",
