            "\u00a0I learned a lot about policy making with regards to healthcare and cancer and about the intricate details of cancer that clarify a lot about the disease. ",
            "\u00a0Solid technical overview of how cancer functions, in-depth looks at many ethical and political questions raised by the ways in which we treat cancer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of cancer treatments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to skim, how to read scientific literature, and how to critically analyze media. I learned a ton about cancer biology, research, treatments, and social issues such as drug pricing and cancer disparities. I developed insight into pharmaceutical companies and cancer research in general after learning that prevention often yields no monetary profit, but treatment does. ",

            "\u00a0The content was very interesting but the quizzes often had questions somewhat unrelated to the content and even if they were open note they were difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Content is extremely interesting, but the order it is taught in often seems scattered. ",
            "\u00a0It focuses greatly on the history of cancer treatments, especially with the history of breast cancer therapies. While the course provided information on this history, it failed to discuss the political aspect of cancer treatments. Furthermore, many of the classes were PowerPoint based; there was no \"seminar\" feel to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learn a ton of information about cancer itself and policy issues surrounding it, listen to guest speakers, from genetic counselors to pharmaceutical company VPs, learn from a professor who was at the journalistic front of much of the course content\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes difficult to know which part of the readings to focus on, opportunity to discuss the readings in class is somewhat limited, quizzes were sometimes confusing ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured well with quizzes every 2 weeks to ensure content is learnt thoroughly which prepares you well for the exam "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would not. There is no discussion in class around the history of cancer treatment or the dilemma behind treatment. Rather, it is a class that is very much based on creating PowerPoints. The quizzes are quite difficult because the questions do not test your overall comprehension of the class discussion, but specific details on PowerPoint slides. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great way to learn about cancer from a multidisciplinary perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is interesting and provides knowledge that can be applied to many situations ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want a science credit that is interesting and also incorporates elements of politics and media. "
