            "\u00a0At face-value, this class is a lot about how the lines on a graph move. However, it is important to note that Professor Schott tries very hard to engage students, encouraging them to \"live and breathe\" the models as lenses to use in their daily life. Learning about Ricardo, HO, and Krugman/Melitz may not seem exciting, learning about how their implications play out in the real world is. Understanding the logic (or lack thereof) of trade wars and unions and more is necessary for any student -- economics major or not. This class is about understanding something so simple, yet so conceptual, and applying it to the intricacies of the real world to glean more than what the pundits may say. ",

We generally learned the qualitative aspects of these models, plus their graphs, without much quantitative emphasis (keep in mind that even intro micro counts as a QR, while this class does not, and there's a reason for that). The class was structured around these models so that we would generally have one large PowerPoint deck and one pset per model. We also had some material about tariffs, gravity, and measuring gains from trade right after spring break. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Schott's class is engaging. He combines theories and examples perfectly. \r\nWeakness: T/F questions on mid-term and final are not the best way to reflect your level of understanding of the class materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include interesting material. Weaknesses include random problem set grading, intense grading and weighting of problems sets, disconnect between coarse material and exams, and too in depth lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material which is nice. It can get very theoretical at times with lots of graphs and crazy shifts of lines that can be hard to follow. There is a disconnect between the first half of the psets and the midterm (the midterm is 10 true/false questions, very hard). The psets line up more with the final in the second half of the course. You better pay attention, because he sometimes calls on students. He won't be upset/embarrass you if you don't know the answer (usually there isn't one right answer) but it's good to pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - slides are clear, Professor Schott is an engaging lecturer, and workload is manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - too many true/false questions, TAs weren't very helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Schott is great. He explains the intuition behind models pretty clearly and is very accessible via email. His powerpoints are immaculate and he'll be the first to tell you about those \"b-school graphics.\" TA's were also very good this year (Daisuke and Charles)\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the True/False/Uncertain format for the tests leaves a lot to be desired. A lot rides on the True/False selection but the questions are often pretty open-ended and require nuance and explanation. It's sometimes hard to know what they are asking for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Subject matter very interesting\r\n- Not an unmanageable workload\r\n- Case studies and applications to real life are littered throughout ppt decks (super cool!) \r\n-Professor Schott is really good at explaining things in \"Plain English Terms\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Sometimes there was a bit of disorganization (PSET due dates changing and moved into reading period)\r\n-PSETs at the beginning were due a bit to close to the time that we went over the material. (This got better towards the end, but put us behind) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very well designed. I actually liked that the midterm and final were equally weighted, and felt that the exams were pretty equitable in terms of difficulty and length. Problem sets were tricky at times, but were a great way of getting inside the models which turned out to be great practice for the tests. I think this will be helpful in terms of evening out grading and not leaving you feeling screwed at the end of a bad exam. \r\n\r\nI think a helpful improvement would be more time spent in class on adjustments/applications/variations of models with practice showing these effects GRAPHICALLY. We spent a fair amount of time discussing different papers and real world observations that related to our models, but often when these questions came up in exams/psets it took some time to think about how these would manifest graphically. ",
            "\u00a0The class is fascinating and Professor Schott is an interesting fellow from the business school. I might mention the leaps made in the exams are a bit longer than one might find comfortable, but all formative, I'm sure! ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class. Well-organized, the problem sets and exams are fair but challenging. The professor cares about the subject material as well as the students. TAs did a good job answering questions and running sections. I never felt that my time was wasted by going to class. I never had a hard time accessing the materials I needed to learn. \r\n\r\nI think more students would show up if it weren't at 9am, but that's a student problem, not a teaching one. Also, teaching in a classroom that is wider and less deep (like LC 101) might encourage more participation when the professor asks questions. ",
            "\u00a0Very difficult curve and grading, but overall and interesting subject ",
            "\u00a0While the course was well-structured, the emphasis on student participation really slowed down the pace and didnt lend itself to a good classroom dynamic. The people who participated most tended to be those with prior experience in the subject, which made the classroom feel like a very white male space. Also, the exams were very far removed from what was covered in class so it made studying seem pretty pointless. The true false format was also very frustrating because the answer ended up being uncertain or it depends, which isnt true to the format of that sort of exam at all. We would have been better off being asked under which circumstances a particular statement was true rather than being left with questions with no correct answer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor! He's funny at times and in good at explaining things the concepts. The pace is good and I didn't feel rushed. Exams and psets were fair.\r\nWeaknesses: We fell behind schedule and had to turn in two psets during reading week. It wasn't that much of a burden, but was unpleasant. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class comes from Professor Schott's lecturing. He's engaging and humorous -- always managing to prod at Yale students in just the right ways to elicit some response at 9am. Also, it helps that there aren't problem sets every week. The structure of the assignments gives you a bit more time to fully absorb the material before working with applications.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class are definitely the lack of office hours (although Professor Schott is available, he's at SOM). There were only two hours a week right before problem sets were due, and one of the office hours was hosted at the CSSSI. Additionally, sections aren't hugely helpful. Usually, section consists of simply reviewing the basic versions of the model, when that time could've been better used to take what we learned in class a bit further or do a difficult example. ",
            "\u00a0Well taught and organized, and unlike several economics courses here at Yale the course does a good job of connecting the models used in class to real-world situations ",
            "\u00a0strengths: peter is a great professor and lecturer\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more office hours/TA hours ",
            "\u00a0The professor was great at lecturing, and section was always helpful in reviewing the problem sets. I just wish that there were more resources available for certain topics, as there were limited amounts of practice problems you could look at. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is great and really care about us learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturing and connection between theory and modern practice. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well organized and lectures are engaging. I found the problem sets somewhat tedious, but I'm not sure how they can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not a big fan of the T/F type questions. While I certainly think there is value in being able to think through whether or not a statement is true/if the model works given some change in the question, I do not think that is the only way we should be tested on PSETs/Exams. I think there should be a mix of quantitative type problems as well. ",
            "\u00a0No more 9am!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I think that it is an interesting course and Professor Schott is a good lecturer however I think that the way the material is tested through problem sets and exams is inconsistent. We were taught very basic concepts but then tested on very obscure versions of them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor was a good lecturer and cared about the course material a lot. Though too much time was spent on explaining simpler mathematical concepts and not enough time spent on intuition behind trade models. Also, course was a little disorganized, as problem sets did not align well with where we were in lecture, and I can't say I enjoyed having a problem set due on the second to last day of reading period. ",
            "\u00a0The true/false exams were very frustrating because it felt like we were being tested on the little stuff (quirks of the models) rather than a deeper understanding of the material.  I came away from both exams feeling that the format did not give me the opportunity to fully express my knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Schott\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Better feedback on problem sets would be greatly appreciated ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is that the professor, Peter Schott, cares a lot about teaching well and actively solicits/acts upon feedback to make the course better. The material is good to know in today's world, and he generally explains the topics clearly alongside detailed explanations in the PowerPoint decks. I also appreciated the speedy grading of the psets and exams; thank you to the 2 knowledgeable and friendly TAs, Daisuke and Charles, for this. The biggest weaknesses were in the administration/implementation of the course. The problem sets were constantly posted late, the due dates for those problem sets were constantly moving around, and especially in the beginning of the course, they covered material that hadn't yet been taught. (To his credit, the professor promised to address this last point about untaught material, and did, when people brought it up.) 2 of the 7 psets in the class were due during reading period as a result of this. The midterm consisted entirely of 8 \"true or false\" questions (with explanations required to support the T/F answer) that didn't seem to test the majority of what we had covered in class. The final exam was mostly true or false as well. I really disliked the true or false structure and felt it didn't give me the opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of the material. True or false is especially bad for this course because the material can be very ambiguous, and there are reasons an answer can go both ways, but if you are wrong, you lose almost all the points. The later psets were mostly T/F as well. Finally, the sample answers to the homework questions and the practice exams were frequently incomplete or straight-up wrong. So while the teaching itself was good, the course needs a lot of work in administration: straightening out the psets, less T/F, and better sample answers for homeworks and practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing, the subject material is fascinating, and the lectures are engaging.  There are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It shouldn't be a 9am. Also I think section should be mandatory, and there should be a required short (1 paragraph ish) reading response for each unit in which students are asked to explain the underlying assumptions and key variables of the unit's model. "

            "\u00a0I think this is a good class to Credit/D if you're not an econ major. It's a little tricky in terms of understanding the theory at times, and the exams can be hard (although the econ curve saves you). I think I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't focused on the grade I was getting. The psets you can submit with another person, though, which is nice in case you have one week with a lot of work. Also, the psets are every other week but don't take that long to do. The first pset is deceptively long. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, one of the best Econ courses I have taken. Really work to participate in lecture and take Professor Schott's words to heart to take risks and let yourself fail. There are so many minute details to the models that really only come out in problem sets and more often on exams. Making the effort to think critically about the conceptual framework in lecture and ask any and all questions you might have will really benefit you throughout the course. I wish I'd done more of it. ",

            "\u00a0Yeah, absolutely. Whether or not you study economics, this course is a fun way to learn some applicable tools for evaluating trade policy. I took it as a means of better understanding US politics, and I learned just that. I had no problem learning the content as a physics major. ",
            "\u00a0One of the better econ classes in the department! Schott is a great lecturer and the workload is manageable (7 psets with option to drop one, one midterm, one final). The topic is really interesting and relatable to trade disputes and related topics you see in the news. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. Yes the PSETs are pretty long, annoying, and challenging. The exams are only true/false and really difficult. But I would absolutely take the class again. The material is super interesting. Trade is such a huge issue in public policy, and this class provides a really deep and fundamental understanding of trade, and especially the benefits of it. Professor Schott is an amazing professor. He deeply cares about everyone in the class doing well and is so approachable and willing to meet and talk anytime about anything. He pretty does anything within his power to satisfy the requests of his students and is super transparent. Plus, he is an awesome lecturer who just explains the material really well. He really tries hard to involve the class in lecture and is constantly seeking class participation. And his lecture slides are exceptional. They are so meticulous and filled with really all of the information you need to know. You can tell just how much time he put into making them. He is also just such a character. So yes the class sucks work wise and is pretty difficult, but if you put in the effort and work through it, it is an amazing class that I am glad I took. ",

But the \"true or false\" structure of the psets and exams is really frustrating, both because the topics are often very ambiguous, with reasons the answer could be true or false (so if you are wrong you lose all or almost all the credit), and because it doesn't really give you the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the material. Especially with regard to problem sets, the course was also kind of disorganized. However, answering a few true or false questions every two weeks on the psets is not much work, and you'll learn some interesting stuff. Averages were in the high-90s on homeworks vs. high-60s on exams, but the class is curved generously, so try to be perfect on homeworks and don't get demoralized by a low exam score. ",
