            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing TAs who provide great insight on course material and post-grad plans, incredible readings (albeit a lot of them), and the opportunity to hear Blight lecture. Weaknesses: The pace of the course is incredibly fast, lectures run up to 20 minutes over time. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good class if you want to learn about the social implications of the Civil War. It did not discuss  a lot of the battles or details of the war itself, but mostly the implications of slavery, Lincoln, and Reconstruction. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good course. Sometimes lectures get a little rambly and off topic, but are mostly very interesting. Does a good job mixing in facts about military history etc with higher level discussions and personal narratives. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture is brilliant but the section was poor and the assignments were frustrating because they were so broad ",
            "\u00a0STRENGHS: very interesting, great readings, overall great structure \r\n\r\nweaknesses: maybe too much reading, lecture seemed really unorganized and hard to follow ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight is the best lecturer. Highly recommend taking this course just to hear his voice, such a compelling orator. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Blight's lectures are incredible. This is a class you will want to go to every Tuesday and Thursday. The course's main weakness is its high volume of reading, some novels which don't seem to pertain to the material taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: While I did have some concerns with this class, it was always a wonderful opportunity to hear Blight think and muse about the Civil War and what he finds most elucidating about it. He's an incredibly talented speaker as long as you take the lecture for what it is. It was a special delight to be in a lecture during the semester that your professor wins the Pulitzer, of course. Some of the selections on the syllabus were really good -- I ended up liking Doyle and McCurry quite a lot and thought those different perspectives on the War were quite interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: Sections were a disaster. There was more reading on the syllabus than anyone could have reasonably expected you to do, especially in the middle of the course, where several consecutive weeks each approached 500 pages of primary and secondary sources. This needs to be cut down -- or, if Blight can't bear to part with anything on the syllabus, be separated into mandatory and recommended reading. So much looked really interesting but was just impossible to get through as college students with busy lives. Also, the QPR system was horrible! It ate up all of our class time and left like 10 minutes at the end of class for an actual conversation about the hundreds of pages we had to read that week! Ditch responses and do 1 (at most 2) presentation(s) per week. Having questions were okay, but when there's so much reading, it really should be the TA's responsibility to ask questions that get at the heart of the text so that we understand the major takeaways. Several students in other sections told me that their TA's were disengaged and unhelpful. We'd spend all of our conversation time talking about things that were present in the reading but not essential to what we were supposed to get out of it. Additionally, the QPR system made it so that missing ONE section dropped your overall -- not just section -- grade. (If you miss one section, the highest you can get in the class is an A-. If you miss two, the highest you can get is a B+.) Dean's excuses are not given for absences in class, let alone a section, making this policy hugely problematic. Finally, the only grade we got back all semester was our first essay, which (at least in my case) had very little feedback, making clear feedback quite hard to come by. \r\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy the lectures in this class and thought a lot of the reading I could do was really great. However, there are issues with this class at present that really need to be addressed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight is the best lecturer I have ever had. The assignments were just the right balance of broad and focused. My TA was also a wonderful section leader. ",
            "\u00a0My TF, Alycia Hall, was a high point of this course, as she was consistently engaged with the material and incorporated her own research interests in our discussions to push the implications of the course material further. Overall, I enjoyed Professor Blight's lectures, which were artfully constructed and strung together with cogent narratives; however, I found that the volume of literary references from the period was often overkill and distracted from some of the core course material. ",
            "\u00a0The Civil War is a very intriguing time period in American history. Because of this, it wasn't hard for me to get interested in the class. Prof. Blight's lectures only increased the interest. His lectures were much different than those in my other history class in good ways and bad ways. He taught with much more passion and many more entertaining stories, but often at the expense of the actual material. Class frequently ran past 11:20 and I'd have to leave a few minutes early to get to Science Hill by 11:35 for my next class in the day. It felt at times as though doing the weekly readings was a better use of time than actually going to class. Prof. Blight's class is nonetheless very fun to attend, but it's an extra fifty minutes in a busy spring day that, from strictly a material standpoint, occasionally could be used better to simply read the class's texts. But all in all, I was a big fan of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the questions that the course sought to answer about the history of the Civil War era were really interesting and that the course is structured really well to give students a critical look at the events of the time. The lectures were really interesting, but it was definitely annoying sometimes to get out of class late everyday. The readings were some of the best parts of the course, although there was so much of it I don't even think the TAs reasonably expected us to finish them. I think the course could benefit from condensing the reading list a bit more so that people actually engage more with the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really well curated subject + readings, learned a ton, really appreciated the perspective on history (the focus on the non-inevitability, contingency, the different social/cultural aspects, etc.) \r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures could have sometimes been structured a little tighter, reading was sometimes a little too much. ",
            "\u00a0I found professor Blight's lectures pretty hard to follow at times. It is clear he is an absolute expert on the subject, but his lecture style was incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes I would have four pages of notes after class, sometimes just one paragraph. The reading load was also pretty overwhelming and quite frankly unreasonable. He let us out 10-15 minutes late every class. That all being said I learned a lot in the course, especially about reconstruction. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the reading list, which covers all facets of the war, and Professor Blight's entertaining lectures.\r\n\r\nThe weakness were that section was sometimes awkward, grading unclear, and the class almost always ran over time. Sticking to a clear schedule and having more consistency amongst TAs could improve these weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight is a fantastic professor who is extremely, extremely passionate about the course material. It's a fantastic class with no real weaknesses. \r\n\r\nMy only tiny suggestion for the future (and I've included this in my thoughts about Professor Blight as an instructor as well in the other evaluation question): Professor Blight doesn't allow students to use the final 30 minutes of their final exam time to keep writing. He says they may only \"edit,\" as per Yale legislation. But all other professors and TFs at Yale allow students to continue writing normally through the final 30 minute period, so students were quite surprised and confused by this during the exam. He had written a small note about it at the top of the exam question sheet, but I -- along with most of the students in the room, I think -- didn't pay much mind to it because we were so used to the normal way of things. Then, near the end of the exam, a student asked about that instruction, and Professor Blight explained it. You could see from the faces throughout the lecture hall that everyone was rather shocked. I think it would be a good idea to allow students that full 30 minute period to continue writing normally, as other Yale instructors do. That's all! Just a small suggestion. ",
            "\u00a0The rule that you cannot miss a single section without a Dean's Excuse or your grade will be dropped half a letter is a wildly unreasonable misunderstanding of how scheduling works, as well as the guidelines behind Dean's Excuses. You cannot get a Dean's Excuse to excuse you from a class, only tests/assignments/presentations. This rule is clearly stated in the Yale College Policy Governing Dean's Excuses. Most classes allow at least one miss or for you to write a reading response if you have to miss section. ",
            "\u00a0Blight is great at broad strokes and thematic overviews. Some lectures, I felt like I gained a lot out of them. He is also really great at narratives and story telling, as a way to understand the tensions and the climate of the era. However, some of these narratives sometimes felt like long rambles that got away from the course. There wasn't an emphasis on details throughout the lectures, yet they are required by the final. The TAs were great at supplementing the lecture because they helped guide us through a lot of the small details in the readings, but I'd been to two different sections, and their teaching style was completely different. Additionally, there were far too many readings some weeks, even on weeks we had papers due. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight is a world class historian, and also a surprisingly casual and funny lecturer. Lectures were always engaging and I always learned new things. And the readings were chosen really well (mostly primary documents or important historical analyses). Basically everything you would want in a history course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: -David Blight's lecture style is fun and informative. I felt very comfortable with the material after his explanations. I especially liked all the unconventional sources he used.\r\nWeaknesses: -This big class is hard to engage with outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish DB had more organized lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight is a great lecturer and is clearly passionate/engaged in what he is lecturing on. I personally enjoyed not having slides during lecture because it forced me to focus on what he was saying. Workload was pretty manageable (2 5-page papers and a 3 hour final) but the readings could exceed over 150+ pages a week (sometimes we were required to read whole books over the week). The biggest weakness is the length of the class - lectures were 50 minutes but every single class Professor Blight kept lecturing past the end for anywhere between 5-10 minutes extra - class time could be shortened by reading less quotes in class or having 75 minute lectures instead. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was great, very informative and engaging. Section was also very helpful, and we went over some different details that we didn't necessarily focus on in the lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Blight often goes on tangents but this is one of the best things about he lectures. He is such a great storyteller and lecturer. ",

Please cut them down so students actually have a chance of finishing them for lecture and section.\r\n\r\nBlight is incredibly engaging and brings a lot of his personality and interests into his lecture. He is amazing to listen to. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the course, especially the lectures. However, the reading was a little heavy which made it difficult to cover all the material during section. ",
            "\u00a0It was too much reading for me to actually do all of it, and I definitely did more reading than many in my section. The lecture was certainly a strength. Blight is very engaging. The section was a weakness - it often felt very forced and I did not love the QPR, which often felt like people just dragging on for their allotted slot and making stuff up during the response. We never touched the questions. ",

            "\u00a0This is a really interesting course that covers good material and I liked the readings, especially the primary sources I thought were really helpful. That said, the amount of reading was a little overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Blight's fabulous, energetic lectures. Weaknesses: Many. Basic good-faith practices in a college course (ending lecture on time, providing lecture slides, timely feedback from TAs) were not respected. I honestly think this is too ambitious of a course. Both the massive readings and the fact that we needed to attend lecture over reading period are evidence that there is just too much content from 1845-77 to cover in one semester. A better move might be having a course solely on the Reconstruction Era, going further in depth into a too-often ignored period in American history. I don't think the Doctorow novel deserves a place on the syllabus. I love comparing fictional narrative with historical narrative, but time is limited, and I'd much rather read about, say, the experience of black women in nineteenth-century America (or even Blight's own Douglass biography!) than a paternalistic, poorly written work of fiction by a white guy. Furthermore, I was really disappointed with section and TAs. My TA was obviously very knowledgeable about the subject, but they provided cryptic, sparse feedback and seemed disengaged. In section, instead of open discussion, we were required to rotate between giving a presentation, a written response, or an oral response to someone else's presentation. By the time this process ended, section would be almost over, depriving us of a real opportunity to engage with more than two or three people or to get input from a TA. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the literary elements of lecture and the narrative flow of the course was very effective. I would have liked to have had even more time with the impacts of the events on communities and individuals that we covered rather than the national reasons for the political events. ",
            "\u00a0David Blight's lectures are rich, personal, bloody, and heartfelt. He brings the Civil War to life through biography, anecdote, literature, and poetry. I would have enjoyed spending more time on Reconstruction. I also wish we'd read fewer shorter texts so we could've read The Battle Cry of Freedom or Black Reconstruction or another seminal historical work in its entirety. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course--it made me want to be a History major. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class for a grade, but think I would have gotten a pretty similar outcome with less stress had I taken it Cr/D or audited it. Come for Blight's poetic lectures and musings. Be wary of what the syllabus asks of you and do everything you can to get a good TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because of professor Blight, but also because of how conducive to student learning the class is. Students attend class, do the readings, and establish a genuine interest in the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to gain a deeper understanding of the Civil War era---from the 1820s to 1870s---, then this is a good course. David Blight is an expert in his field and an incredibly engaging professor. Don't expect for the course to go much beyond the election of 1876 to tackle the legacy of the Civil War in the Jim Crow era and the Civil Right Movement, however. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not. Though Professor Blight is an extremely successful historian, lectures were dry, unorganised and often mostly tangential/irrelevant. Also always went over time. The readings were good but assignments were too long meaning its unlikely students do all of them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I'd 100% recommend this class to another student, especially if they like American history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if youre okay with rants about how the electoral college should be abolished, how bad Republicans are etc. If you want to learn about the Civil War in an objective setting, this class isnt for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in the Civil War era and you like Yale's history courses, I definitely think this one is one that you ought to take. It's such an important time in American history that has shaped what America looks like today. Professor Blight is super passionate and all of the TAs are really great at leading discussions about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting class that gives an in depth look and nuanced perspective on an incredibly important part of US history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class as a credit/d. The reading load is pretty intense. The lack of a midterm exam also made preparation for the final pretty daunting. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably recommend this course to another student because you should absolutely take a course with David Blight but understand you will be studying the Civil War. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Blight's lectures are riveting. Even for you Civil War buffs out there -- the Civil War will been more real and exciting than it is when you sit in this class. Professor Blight presents the information clearly and passionately. The courseload isn't too overwhelming, either: two short papers and a final. ",
            "\u00a0I think the information is really powerful and important for any person living in the United States. I may not have loved the structure of the course overall, but I really enjoyed some of the readings and I came out of some lectures thinking a lot about the effects of this time period on today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. This course is accessible and interesting to everyone. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0David Blight is a treasure. If you have the slightest interest in more thoroughly understanding the multidimensional histories of the Civil War and Reconstruction, this course is an opportunity you should not pass up. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - lots of reading, but it is a great course and very rewarding. My TF, Jesse Williams, gave me very specific feedback-the best of any professor/tf ever. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Initially I was hesitant to take this course thinking that I already knew enough about the Civil War from APUSH but it was worth it in the end. The course goes much more in-depth than in high school and explores different perspectives and ideas that I had not heard about before. Professor Blight does a great job of making the class and concepts interesting. The class would run over time about 5-10 minutes, which was my main drawback with the class, but otherwise it was a fun course to fulfill my humanities requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would. There's a lot of reading, but it's a very interesting time period and I enjoyed learning about it in more detail than I did in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great introduction to history at Yale and Professor Blight is an interesting lecturer - be prepared to really work though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Please take it. Blight is such a good lecturer and it is worth it if only just to listen to him. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fascinating but the reading list is insane. If you are someone who might be bothered by not being able to do all the readings, this class might not be for you. That being said, its a very interesting time period that helps explain a lot of where we are as a nation today. Learning about th civil war should be mandatory in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes, an amazing history course with a fantastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0Probably would recommend. Lectures are good and engaging, but section was a drag and the reading became overwhelming halfway through the semester when it felt like we were being asked to read a book a week. If this class can be a priority of yours, take it. If youve got other commitments during the semester that might take away from your engagement, you might not get as much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but lots of reading ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the subject or want a prominent and interesting professor I would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot about the Civil War and Reconstruction era that I did not know before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but not as a super engaging class. Definitely don't take if you already have general knowledge about the subject, this course is super survey level and no deeper ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Blight's lectures are always enjoyable, even if they aren't the most informative. While the content of the course may not go much further than  what many students already know about the civil war, the civil war is a necessity for all American students to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - take it for Blight. Hes a delight ",
            "\u00a0If you want a great history lecture taught by a leader in his field, absolutely. I loved going to lecture and going more in depth into the Civil War era. \r\nThat said, its a lot of reading and section could feel like a waste of time and also added work (with presentations and responses). ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely very important material which is relevant to national issues today ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone who lives in the US should be familiar with the legacy of the civil war. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for the material but too much reading ",
            "\u00a0Yes! David Blight is incredible and you will just be wowed every lecture. It is such an important piece of history to learn about, so I am so glad I took the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the course was engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but warn anyone considering it that it is a lot a lot of reading and also Blight goes over time in almost every single lecture. I didn't have a class directly after but if I had had one I think this lecture would have stressed me out a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Blight is a fantastic lecturer and the material is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is highly overrated. Yes, Blight's lectures are fantastic, but just watch them online and skip the rest. The course is almost disrespectful of students' time. First of all, Professor Blight ended lecture almost 15 minutes late every day, forcing many students to get up and leave at 11:20 while class continued around them. There was also scheduled lectures with new content and expected attendance that took place over reading period, which is just unreasonable (you have a whole semester to teach content; reading period is for students to study for all their classes). Furthermore, a fact not well demonstrated in the syllabus is that missing just ONE section for this class will lower your final grade for the course by a third of a letter grade (so from A to A-, A- to B+). I found that TAs were, for the most part, not very invested in their sections or their students, and at the same time, graded harshly, which is a really unfair combination. Finally, of course, the reading was too much, sometimes more than 300 pages a week. The readings on the syllabus are already somewhat vague (for the books, to what page numbers, by which days?), and Blight adds more reading on Canvas via the TAs, announced the week of. My TA had to tell us which readings to actually prioritize, which is an obvious sign that there are too many (if a reading is less important, just don't assign it). Until there are major changes to sections, and to the course's general policies and practices, I would not recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this course covers a crucial moment in American history and is brought to life and to significance by professor Blight's approach. ",
            "\u00a0David Blight is an outstanding lecturer who makes history feel present and alive. In this class, you'll have the chance to read a huge variety of texts relating to the Civil War, ranging across genres: speeches, slave narratives, biographies, congressional testimonies, and so on. It'll make you a better historical thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because Professor Blight is a great lecturer and really knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Blight is really engaging as a lecturer and storyteller though his lectures sometimes go off track, he clearly cares about your learning and is interested in and knowledgeable about what he's teaching. This course also provides you with an important background in the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era that is a necessary part of learning history, not just of the US. ",
