            "\u00a0I learned how to use more formal Chinese and grammar patterns, as well as many vocabularies. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of vocabulary and grammar, and a lot of speaking practice as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new Chinese grammatical phrases, vocabulary terms, and I learned how to further think in Chinese, as opposed to thinking in English and then translating the thoughts to Chinese. I also learned a bunch of new Chinese idioms, stories, and historical facts. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how to read, write, and converse about a wide variety of topics in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Very level appropriate as far as skills, knowledge, etc., go. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Chinese language and grammar. I also learned more about Chinese culture. "

            "\u00a0The class was strong overall; however, it was the first year in which it was a three day a week course, making it difficult to fully process new information before moving on, especially since older lessons were not revisited and vocabs in old lessons were irrelevant once we moved on. Cumulative learning was difficult. The exams tested skills that weren't practiced in class or on homework, like writing and translation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of speaking practice, small class sizes so you get to know your classmates and professor, fun class, lots of opportunities to express opinions on more complex issues in Chinese, a lot of different kinds of assignments so students with various strengths can still do well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a lot of vocab and grammar at a very quick pace, so it's dangerous to fall behind once and then try to catch up ",
            "\u00a0You learn a bunch of new vocabulary words and grammatical structures. The Chinese faculty is also fantastic. The essay writing is pretty fun, and the oral presentations are interesting. Not having weekly tests is fantastic, and I like the new quiz structure a lot. \r\n\r\nI think the course is weakest in terms of chances at speaking. I wish there was even more times for students to speak inside and outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors are extremely nice and helpful. \r\n\r\nMore exercises would definitely help. I honestly think the translation exercises are important but the instructors didn't think so. ",
            "\u00a0Memorizing a lot of words for each class can be tiring, but it profoundly helped me widen the depth and range of my vocabulary. A possible weakness of this course is the pace, which may feel a bit quick at times. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate the three days of class time rather than five. The work is a very large time commitment, but is helpful and makes sense with the difficulty of the course.\r\nI would appreciate another tutor / 1 on 1 session per week, or even the option of paying for one privately. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of this course is how much Li laoshi cares about student learning. She will spend extra time and energy with you to ensure that you have a profound understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that it is very hard to achieve a solid proficiency of Chinese when you only meet 3 times a week. Therefore the amount of work students must do outside of class in order to reach such a mastery is very high. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it, as it is an L5 course and if placed into it, its definitely survivable, just a lot of memorization on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Tough course, but amazing professors who really care about students as people but also as learners. They really care about your improvement and pay close attention to you throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student wanting to continue their language learning. It is the natural progression, and the only way to keep your Chinese good is to keep using it. You also learn a bunch more useful vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students, especially those who want to become more proficient in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's difficult to learn Chinese, however the Yale Chinese department does its best to encourage and help students. "
