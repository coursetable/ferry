            "\u00a0This course taught me about mechanics, special relativity, and thermodynamics. Instead of teaching topics as separate units, it synthesized the material so that I now understand how all physics fits together. Professor Padmanabhan is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He takes extremely complicated topics and boils them down to simpler, logical pieces that are easier to understand. The lectures are the basis of the class, but the psets build on them better than any other class I've taken, and the exams are fair, with midterm corrections so that you have the chance to figure out what you couldn't during the actual test. This course is definitely hard, but Professor Padmanabhan helps you through it, taking many hours of his own time to re-explain concepts in different ways until you understand them. I've gotten much better at thinking through problems and have learned so much through this class, even though it was very time consuming and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, it was a physics class so I really just learned a lot of physics. We did a lot of mechanics. I had never done Langrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics before, so that was fun! We did special relativity, coupled oscillations, and a little bit of thermo at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I learned plenty of new material in physics, but even more new methods and approaches to problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about classical mechanics, special relativity, and some thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0Youll start with classical mechanics, \r\n oscillation, go into lagrangians, Hamiltonians, central forces, collisions, special relativity and end with thermodynamics. Its a lot to cover but I think the pace of the class was good. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about advanced classical mechanics and developed my problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped with my time management skills and teamwork since there was a very collaborative environment ",
            "\u00a0We covered oscillations, central forces, Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, coupled oscillations, and special relativity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned physics concepts and problem solving techniques relevant to the major. ",
            "\u00a0Physics ",
            "\u00a0Definitely improved my functional (both meanings) math skills. Especially DiffEq and LinAlg (neither of which I had taken.)\r\nVery good intro to simple thermo, good review of mechanics and relativity, learned relativistic collisions! "

            "\u00a0This class is organized amazingly and taught incredibly well. Professor Padmanabhan really cares about his students' learning, and organizes tons of review sessions, as well as a weekly study hall and office hours so that we had plenty of time to ask questions and get extra help. The only problem I had with the course was that the psets were at first far too time consuming, taking between 20 and 25 hours a week to complete on average. It took many times talking to the Professor for him to understand how long these problems were taking us (I think he just didn't realize how hard they were since it's all easy for him), but once he did he changed the format so that they would be 6 problems instead of 10, with extra practice problems. This was a great resolution to this issue, since the psets are now manageable and we have extra practice problems for the exam. I really appreciated that our opinion and feedback was taken into account in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The number one strength of this course was definitely Professor Padmanabhan who was perhaps the best professor Ive had at Yale. His lectures were amazingly clear and he was so great at answering questions. There was never a hint of condescension in his answers and he could almost always immediately identify what part of the concept I was struggling with. As far as weaknesses go, the problem sets for this class are fairly long. Professor Padmanabhan shortened them part of the way through the semester in response to our comments, so it didnt end up being too bad. And even though they were long, they were really useful and definitely helped me gain a better understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Seems pretty good to me. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are long and draining. But if you speak to Nikhil and are honest about the length hes willing to adjust and work with the class ",
            "\u00a0Nikhil was amazing and did such a good job teaching and being responsive to the students. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well paced and well taught however I think students should be advised to take phys 200 instead of 180 as a prerequisite ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was proof based, but didnt give us a lot of preparation for completing problem sets. It was really easy to get lost in the math during class and then not pay attention because you didnt really know what you were solving for. Problem sets were also really long and challenging. An 8-10 question problem set routinely took me about 20 hours, and that was with me working with other people and going to tutoring and office hours and using multiple online textbooks and resources and examples. I think more practice problems should be done in class, and less time on proofs since we werent really tested on those. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, helpful with difficult concepts, good spread of topics\r\nWeaknesses: some problem sets were somewhat difficult for a 1 week assignment, or were too long ",
            "\u00a0Nikhil is a really good teacher, the material can be difficult but that's physics for you ",
            "\u00a0It's a tough course! At the beginning I think Prof. Padmanabhan expected a bit more homework output from us than we could muster, but he was very receptive and understood and adapted the class (still covering all the material, just with fewer repetitive questions.)\r\n\r\nI wish we received some more indication of where we went wrong when we made homework mistakes.\r\n\r\nGreat class for what it is. "

            "\u00a0I'm not a huge fan of physics, and I took this class because I had to, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Nikhil is an excellent lecturer, very clear. I thought he did a good job of motivating why we study a particular class of problems rather than just randomly selecting a bunch of horrible systems to try to analyze. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets were quite difficult, but I thought the tests were very fair. Nikhil also spent a lot of time helping up prepare for the midterm, and really cares about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Take it over 410!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is challenging, but taught me a lot about both physics and new ways to look at the world and solve problems. Also, Professor Padmanabhan is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! I would very eagerly recommend it. Professor Padmanabhan is a true gem and this class is challenging in a really good way. I feel like I left this class with a really deep understanding of all of the concepts. If you want to learn physics thoroughly and learn it well, then this is definitely the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in physics beyond the introductory sequence. Even though the course technically covered the same subject matter as PHYS 200, the understanding of the material that this class demands is on a different level. ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty good course and the professor is a pretty good lecturer and happy to spend time helping students out of class. The problem sets might be harder than you expect, so I'd recommend going to weekly \"study halls\" from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, then you have to just find a good group to take it with and youll get through. If youre a physics wizard, this class will definitely be interesting and give you some more involved and higher level problems to practice with. If youre not, please find some great people to take it with so you can all take turns explaining concepts that some people may get more than others. Nikhil does make the class better with him willing to work with us when it came to the long problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0If they are planning on majoring in physics or some form of engineering I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is super challenging but rewarding ",
            "\u00a0Despite its incredibly heavy and challenging workload, this class was also really interesting. Nikhil was a fantastic Professor and I would only recommend this class if he taught it again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As long as Professor Padmanabhan is teaching. He was incredibly helpful when dealing with difficult material ",
            "\u00a0If you're a (non intensive) physics major, you don't really have a choice, but sure, I'd recommend it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if Prof. Padmanabhan is teaching it - he's a phenomenal Physics teacher. "
