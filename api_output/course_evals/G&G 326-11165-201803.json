            "\u00a0Learned about everything inside Earth, from the core to the mantle to the crust, and all the physics going along with it (thermo, magnetism, radioactivity, a smattering of astro) ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a wide range of physics concepts and how they can be applied to geophysics in a planetary context. I also learnt a lot about a range of geological topics. ",

            "\u00a0Overall great course with interesting material covering a wide array of topics.\r\n\r\nThe homework or the test questions were sometimes seemed arbitrary and did not match the material taught in lectures. I think more time needs to be put into the wording of the questions, making sure they align with class material with a clear learning outcome. The material is not difficult at all but the homework/tests were sometimes confusing. It also could be that we are trying to cover so many topics in one semester that rigorously understanding any one topic becomes difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: due to the survey nature of this course, we moved from one topic to another quickly (every lecture pretty much introduces something completely new) so it was hard to gauge what we needed to focus on for tests. This is also the reason why I felt that preparing for this class relied more on memorization than actually understanding some of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really cool subject matter. Great overview, all the way from the atomic to the planetary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: disproportionate amount of math/calc (that probably wasn't actually necessary for the class) considering prerequisites did not include such material. Assignments ranged in difficulty some homeworks were very straightforward; others took way too long. Midterm was nearly impossible (was effectively a multivariable calc exam) but take-home final was very relaxing and fun.  Grading could at times be arbitrary: -1 for huge mistakes on some questions, but half credit on others for minor typos/sig figs. It seemed like grading rubrics were being written ex post facto. Labs were fun but took more time than we got useful knowledge/skills out of them. ",
            "\u00a0This class could be difficult if you did not have a strong math/physics background. ",
            "\u00a0There often seemed to be a disconnect between what we discussed in lectures and what appeared on homework or tests - making it very difficult to feel adequately prepared for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very fun, and the material was excellent. The assignments, however, were unpredictable. Some were far too easy, others far too hard. Often the grading was opaque; the rubrics were written in order to justify grades that had already been given, not used to guide standardized grading. Especially galling was the midterm, on which the highest score was an 80% and the mean score was a 65%, and which went unscaled. With 14 diligent students in the class, including 3 grad students, the fact  that no one was able to get higher than an 80% indicated that there was a systematic problem in the kinds of questions that were written, and Prof. Lee refused to concede that. In general, I think assignments of more consistent length and difficulty would be better.\r\nAlso, fewer derivations done in class. I think that they are interesting, and important, but that they would be most useful if they were set up as parts of a homework problem, so we could practice going through it ourselves. Watching derivations was boring and a waste of class time. By far the best part of the class was the conceptual stuff, and I wish that all the material at the end hadn't been so rushed. The best way to do that would probably be to summarize derivations in class instead of going all the way through them.\r\nThe labs also could have been more useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is engaging as an introductory geophysics course, but by its broad reach in topics there are questions left that could only be answered through a more in-depth study of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include multifaceted learning, such as how we participated in labs in addition to normal homework, and how we learned about scientific methodology and history in addition to just geophysics. Additionally, class was very enjoyable and the lectures were engaging and informative. One area for improvement would be fewer conceptual questions and more computational questions on homework, as there were some formulae and models that we never were able to use, and the grading on conceptual questions was at times frustrating.

            "\u00a0If you are an undergrad, you'll be taking it with graduate students so do not trust the prerequisites listed on the course description, which says that you only need to know introductory math and physics. This is a lie as we were expected to already know about thermodynamics. I had only taken PHYS 180/181 and MATH 120 before this course and it was not too bad, but there were many moments where I felt blind sighted by the material we were supposed to have learned \"from previous classes.\" Because of this, I felt that I was not able to extract as much from the lectures as other students who had taken higher level courses, who could probably appreciate the math more than I.\r\n\r\nWith that said, if you enter this class barely meeting the prereqs, accepting that you'll have to teach yourself a few things or that some of the math you'll just have to get through without quite understanding, then this class can be a great experience as it encompasses a range of interesting topics. Before coming into this class, I thought, \"rocks, who cares?\" Now after having taken this class, I can honestly say that rocks are really cool because they tell us so much about the Earth, and that the Earth itself is kind of a miracle. The Earth is so much more than just a rock floating in space (as I have previously thought.) You'll get to learn about the composition and formation of other planets, the techniques used to model the Earth and exoplanets, and the secret processes that go on inside stars and planets. If any of that sounds remotely interesting, you should take this course. In terms of assignments, the PSETs are not time-consuming and they complement the lectures well; the final was fair. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a taste of geophysics, I would definitely recommend! Note that this is *not* an astro class, if that's what you're looking for. Big focus on seismology, heat transfer within the earth, chemical composition of the layers of the earth. Be aware, too, that this is geophysics, not geology. Relatively math/physics-heavy; not as much rocks and volcanoes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0This class is cool and relatively relaxed, but can be frustrating at times. If you like getting clear feedback about your work and having a predictable workload, this class is not for you (unless you're taking it to have fun and don't really care how you do). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for a G&G major who's primary area of focus is not planetary physics, or for other physical science majors looking for practical applications of physics and thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the class is very interesting and the instructor is very fun, so if you're at all interested in the material I would recommend the class. However, just be aware that it is graded rather steeply, maybe more so than one would expect in an elective class. "
