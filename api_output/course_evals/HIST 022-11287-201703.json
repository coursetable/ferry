            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of the science of history and what it teaches. It covers pretty much all of history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and understand complex texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of studying history, fiction, and classics. This course stresses the need for good writing, and teaches how to digest/skim a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0This class developed my ability to think critically about history as a discipline and to examine the philosophy of the subject. It was almost entirely discussion-based, except for a few short writing projects, so it developed my ability to synthesize and digest information in a seminar setting as well, which was a skill I never had to learn at the large public high school I attended. ",
            "\u00a0Looked critically at history and how it is defined, written, and utilized. ",
            "\u00a0A very large amount of time was wasted on reading Tolstoy and other really long works. Most of the valuable, thought provoking lessons/insights we were supposed to learn were actually all very eloquently summed up in landscapes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to study the philosophy of history, and how to critical evaluate histories written by myself and others. ",
            "\u00a0As a prospective history major. I was overjoyed to take a class that promised to challenge my conceptions of both the form and purpose of history. Professor Gaddis duly fulfilled those promises. I left the class with a far greater appreciation of \"what history teaches,\" why it teaches, how it teaches, and its limitations. This historiography/philosophy of history class gave me an important meta grounding for my future coursework in the subject and my thinking about the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to manage long required readings better. \r\nThe insights we were exposed to generally lingered until well after the end of class, which is something I thoroughly enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0I truly learned \"what history teaches\" in this course. This class shifted my paradigm and changed my world views in many way. Bow I am surer than ever that I love history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that history teaches us a lot.\r\n\r\nI also learned that historians have a lot of creative license when they write about civilizations. ",
            "\u00a0I obtained a whole new understanding of what history is and what history does.  I was pushed to explore the field of history from multiple different angles -- how it functions in terms of art, science, math, fiction, etc. "

            "\u00a0At some points the purpose of the discussion is hard to follow, but for the most part I learned something every day. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging and interesting material, challenging and rewarding discussion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: EXCELLENT professor, great readings, insights. Weaknesses: lots of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills were a major focus of the graded work and I felt I improved a lot there. I think this class is best when its focussed on giving practical feedback on how to best write history in a logical, considered manner. Having extra  assignments instead of 1000's of pages of random reading would probably make it substantially better. ",
            "\u00a0It was a truly excellent - the readings were fantastic, and the discussions were strong. I think it might be helpful to include a writing assignment that focuses on doing archival research, to help us develop that skill, rather than learn about it in theory. ",
            "\u00a0The strength has to be Professor Gaddis. His life experiences and accomplishments are legendary and hearing them was truly a treat. While the course was billed as a seminar, in reality, it functioned as a solar system revolving around Gaddis. The strength of this was greater airtime for Gaddis, the weakness was a more lectureish feel. Another weakness of the course was the seemingly random syllabus. While Gaddis like an expert naval man guided us through it, at first glance I couldn't see the connections. A little more explanation at the beginning of the course would help to solve this problem. The other part of the problem was the inconsistent workload. Some weeks we would have very little while others would ask us to read 400 pages of War and Peace over the weekend. A warning of time management would have been useful at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing and I think it's good the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nProfessor John Lewis Gaddis' stories are meaningful and inspiring\r\nThe readings are really well selected\r\nI liked that a lot of readings were assigned, and we were not tested on them. That way I could enjoy them more. I still read them.\r\n\r\nWeakeness\r\nDead Certainties is awful. ",
            "\u00a0There were no weaknesses to this course. It was the most inspiring course that I have taken at Yale. Professor Gaddis shared with us his personal understandings of History, and I will keep his insights with me for the rest of my life. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone with a genuine interest in history. The reading list is heavy-duty, but as long as you are willing to take on the entirety of War and Peace, it is incredibly rewarding and will change the way you think. The writing assignments were spread out nicely and included some very colorful prompts that will be a pleasure to respond to. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course. It is a lot of reading (Supposedly ~2x the normal Freshman seminar amount), but It's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a course that will change previously held views. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend. It was a TON of reading - count on 300 page novels due the next class, or dense 60-page philosophy essays and a couple chapters of Gaddis' books. Plus all 1215 pages of War and Peace throughout the semester. That being said, none of the reading is required for the essays or discussions. The writing assignments are very clever - lots of creative work that was fun to compose! Most days, I would leave class completely awed, with a new perspective or thought to ponder for the next couple days. Professor Gaddis is fantastic, and has a great sense of humor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to other students. It was not only informative, but enjoyable, and it shaped the way I look at history as a discipline. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, quite the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably not recommend this course to very many people. Even if you put a lot (like a lot) of work into it I don't feel you get much more out of it than someone who takes a super casual approach. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course was fantastic, and Professor Gaddis is brilliant. I feel like those of us in the seminar got to see how his mind works, and that's a special treat. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The topics are applicable no matter where your major lies, and Professor Gaddis is an unparalleled and unique resource. ",
            "\u00a0I most definitely would! ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this class. Professor Gaddis is an amazing historian and a fabulous mentor. He has so much wisdom and knowledge to share with his students. Throughout the semester I always looked forward to going to this class. If you take this class, I guarantee that you will learn things that will stay with you for the rest of your life, and you will think about things you've never thought about before. If you are lucky to get in his class, by all means PLEASE TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0This class makes you look at the world in a different way. You see how small individuals are in the landscape of history. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was a life-changing experience. It has a very high workload, but it is totally worth the extra hours. "
