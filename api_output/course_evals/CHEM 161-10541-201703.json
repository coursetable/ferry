We were still expected to do the reading and come to class to have that reinforced. I often found that in class, the exact same things from the reading were being discussed and it was boring. It did not draw my attention or expand on my knowledge. I have several classmates who skipped all but a few of the lectures and still have the same grade as me in the class because they kept up with the readings. The lectures did not provide any incentive to go. Nothing was gained from the lectures, except maybe very small and specific pieces of information included on the exams as his way of tricking all the people who did not regularly attend class. The only side note to this is that the demonstrations were cool to see in class, but often I did not find them overly enlightening by themselves.

I think its wrong that the course is set up to assume that everyone has some baseline knowledge before they even walk in the door for the very first lecture. Then, you're expected to teach yourself the new material before each class (and be tested on it beforehand), which is just ridiculous. This also enables the professor to not teach by explaining that we should've learned it beforehand. ",

In additions, there were a lot of resources to help students outside the classroom. The main weakness of this class was that I didn't feel like I learned much in the classroom at all. The lectures moved too quickly for any information to be retained and portions that aren't relevant to exams were stressed for too long in one lecture.

As someone who did not have access to this type of advanced science course in high school, the format and speed at which this class was taught was extremely distressing.  I understand that there is a steep learning curve that accompanies the transition from college to high school, but this course was extremely difficult to adapt to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class demos that showed concepts, a lot of resources provided for help if needed\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult to keep every student engaged (nature of lecture class); confusing when professor or TF would complete a problem wrong and we would run out of time in class ",
            "\u00a0Good coverage of the basic concepts in chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course lay in the amount of resources given to us for extra practice and help. Though some people didn't have my luck, my TF was great. I also appreciated how much our practice problems and problem sets were taken into account for our final grade. \r\n\r\nHowever, there were several weaknesses with the course. For one, there were extraordinary disparities between the skill levels of the students taking the course. I, for instance, came in without taking any high school chemistry courses, but I know a significant portion of the class took AP, IB, or multiple years of chemistry and could have done well in higher leveled chemistry courses. Starting from scratch while so many others around you are already coming in with a wealth of knowledge is daunting. I feel like the instructor was aware of this, and despite the course being described as one for students with 0-1 years of chemistry knowledge, he seemed to assume some knowledge on our part that made several lectures hard to follow. \r\n\r\nThe lectures themselves were a bit flawed. Timing-wise, I had a class on the other side of campus that started 15 minutes after chemistry was supposed to end, 11:20. As such, I needed to leave precisely at 11:20 to make it, which meant I sometimes missed the useful parts of lecture because the timing of the lecture was a bit off. In terms of format, I wasn't a fan of the flipped-classroom style. Though I realize that there's always an element of self-teaching when learning, I felt that I ended up teaching myself the vast majority of concepts. Several lectures, such as those on hybridization, VSEPR theory, MO theory, and even some stoichiometry left me more confused than when I went in to lecture. I hope future iterations of the course will try to explain these concepts more fully with fully worked-out examples. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the information was presented very well and there were so many helpful resources available to all students. The class is just such a huge lecture which is something I dislike although I understand you cannot really avoid it. ",
            "\u00a0The content was pretty well structured. Lectures were somewhat unhelpful, especially when the professor very obscure and specific examples instead of taking the time to thoroughly explain basic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it really does teach you a lot, but it does move quite fast. If you fall behind, you may have a hard time catching up. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good class for teaching such a large lecture. The format with lecture, discussion, problem sets, and daily readings/practice problems/reflections force students to keep up with their work.

            "\u00a0The course is really well-designed in that all students are required to use \"clickers\" to check understanding and to boost class engagement. I also think that Professor Holland is really invested in making sure that all the students feel that they are participating in the course, since he holds lots of office hours and consistently gives his students feedback through Canvas emails. For a lecture course, the class is remarkably personalized and student-oriented. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught quite well and class meetings are interactive. There are office hours either with Professor Holland or a Teaching Fellow every day of the week, so getting help is easy. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that the professor provides students with a lot of resources that range from websites to office hours. The professor also does try to engage students by making connections and applications to real life, and demonstrates using experiments.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to see improved is the number of practice problems offered for students to use to study. Throughout the course of this semester, I found it difficult to study for the exams because the way the content is formatted is very different from that of the Sapling or textbook problems. I think more practice exams should be made accessible for students to be able to do more practice. ",
            "\u00a0By far the weakest aspect of this course was the lectures. As the semester progressed, the lectures became more disorganized and confused. It was difficult to decipher what the overall objective of the lecture was and how it related to the assigned reading of the previous night. In all, there was a general consensus among students that going to lecture was a waste of time. ",

However, I would have liked more practices tests to be available. I enjoyed the overall structure of the class as well: readings the night before class, practice problems, in-class lectures, clicker questions during class, practice sets for the chapter, three midterms, and a final exam. However, I often didn't do the readings the night before. This made it easy to be distracted during class and therefore, the in-class lectures weren't very useful for me. I also enjoyed the demonstrations that were done in class, but I often found them to be a little unnecessary and a waste of time, especially since class usually started late and we would run out of time to finish going through all the lecture slides.

Discussion section and the outside homework were much more useful. ",
            "\u00a0This class's main strength was the large amount of resources provided to students that needed any help, and we repeatedly had opportunities to engage in the material through practice problems, discussion section, and in class material. If there was any weakness, it was simply that due to time constraints, we would have to continue at a rapid clip through the ongoing material while we were studying for midterm hour exams. I felt that in this period I was more distracted from the most recent material we were studying because I cared more about my understanding of the past material I would be tested on. ",
            "\u00a0The class can be better structured. The lectures hardly touch upon concepts in the test. Since the test is heavily math focused and the lectures are information based, I find the lectures to be extremely unhelpful. ",

The grading of the class is very direct and Professor Holland lays out the grading syllabus at the beginning of the class. The lowest of the three midterm exams gets dropped which is very helpful and allows students to do better in the class. Some of the weaknesses of the class is that there is a wide range of skill level of the students. Some of the students in the class have taken AP chemistry while others have never taken a chemistry class before. Another weakness is that the lectures are so big so it can be difficult to focus on the material. ",

Lectures were not extremely helpful, but they reinforced what we learned from our readings prior to each class. I think it would be more helpful if lecture material and textbook material were more directly related. However, psets and homework load were reasonable, and the discussion sections were pretty helpful in giving us more practice problems. ",

There are a multitude of resources available to help you succeed if you choose to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nOne major weakness, perhaps unavoidable, is that these many different means of reinforcing the material mean that the process of learning each chapter's content is scattered across many weeks.  Typically, we did readings, practice problems, and lectures on a given chapter from one Wednesday to the following Monday.  Then the discussion section would take place perhaps a few days after we had finished that chapter, and the problem set would be due in another week after we had already moved on to new topics.  By the time we took the exam for chapters 4-6, we were learning chapter 9 material in class.  This sometimes made it difficult to keep track of various material. ",

I would have liked to see more clicker questions/exam questions in class and be given a few minutes to solve them on our own before he professor goes over them in class.

The exams were usually fair and clear, but, in some cases, too long. \r\nI think lectures sometimes moved by too fast, or certain topics were not covered with enough detail, especially considering their later importance in Psets and the exams. I felt the lecture lacked a bit more explanations pertaining to theory, we often spent a lot of time watching the Professor explain his way through problems on the chalk-board. The class itself moves too fast. There were times when we were preparing for an exam on chapters 4,5, and 6. Working on a Pset for chapter 7, but listening to a lecture on chapter 8.

This may in part have to do with the fact that I had never taken AP Chem in high school. I found that people who took the AP before benefitted much more from the style of the class than those who did not. I feel that another system to allow more individualized learning needs to be set up in order to benefit those in the bottom half of the class.

However, I have a number of concerns about the way the class was conducted.\r\n\r\n-Instructing students not to work together on the weekly problem sets is very unusual for a STEM class and makes the homework less useful. STEM classes traditionally encourage students to work together because this improves their learning.\r\n\r\n-The pace of the class was rushed, which resulted in a large amount of work being assigned and in some topics being covered superficially. Covering less material in more depth would improve the class.\r\n\r\n-Assigning practice questions for each class and requiring student \"reflections\" on the topics covered is unnecessary. It is students' own responsibility to learn the material and grading them on this activity is not needed in college classes. While I understand that this has the benefit of offering easily available points to students, that can just as well be done by grading the class more leniently if the instructors want a generous grade distribution.\r\n\r\n-Grading on attendance, which is what the clicker questions essentially were, is also unnecessary for college students since it is their responsibility to attend class.\r\n\r\n-Grades were submitted after the deadline and on-time submission would improve the quality of the class. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that it required a lot of individual effort to figure out problem sets and stay engaged. \r\nLectures were not that effective for learning for me. I learned best from the book. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the class were discussion sections and clicker questions. During discussion section, there was a clear outline of what we were to do and the questions provided were always helpful in learning. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved by making the exams closer to the chapters they are testing. Also, using sig figs on Sapling would lead to a much better understanding of sig figs. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the fact that a vast array of concepts are introduced allowing people not too familiar with chemistry to learn about the different areas. However, this also was a weakness as the course moved too fast and not enough time was spent on reviewing the harder concepts as needed. Furthermore, the problem sets on sapling and very lengthy and become confusing as there are no guided examples for the difficult questions; I was often completely unsure of how to approach problems. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would help tremendously if the lectures aligned with the reading material more in terms of relevance. This was especially true leading up to exams, where we would be covering multiple future chapters the day before an exam of material covered long ago in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0My discussion section was a huge strength, but I honestly felt that the way lectures were ran were a huge weakness. The lectures were disorganized and unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength of the course was that the class was very well structured; we were able to cover a lot of material, but it never felt like we were moving too quickly. Additionally, I felt that the format of the class was helpful because you had some understanding of what would be taught / knew what you didn't understand before you got to lecture. The main way I feel like the course could be improved is that because the lectures were only fifty minutes, especially if we did a lot of watching videos/ demos during that period, it felt like we didn't have enough time to be explicitly taught the material/ ",

            "\u00a0The p sets were super helpful, I often looked at them when reviewing for tests. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a weakness was the lectures. In the lectures, we covered more conceptual topics while the tests were very much problem solving centered. I think the course would improve if we solved test questions step by step and include the conceptual concepts by integrating them into the teaching of the math. A strength was the review sessions. I learned the most the two days before the test. ",

            "\u00a0I didn't find the clickers or reflection questions helpful. I don't agree with the clickers because I shouldn't be graded for my attendance, as long as I prove that I can learn the material otherwise. I did like the psets and section though, which helped me cement my knowledge in a low stress environment. ",
            "\u00a0I think the set up of the course is well structured and reasonable. However, I highly suggest having more than one practice exam for each midterm and final. The practice exams provided did not really prepare us for the actual exam because it was a lot less difficult than the actual exam. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that it is well-organized. Another strength is that the textbook does a good job at explaining most of the concepts we learn in class. One weakness of the course is that the lectures are often focused on everyday examples rather than on techniques on how to solve problems. Another weakness is that 50 minutes does not seem to be enough time to go over everything we read about in the book. More emphasis on the concepts rather than explaining their significance in the world could help fit more content into the 50-minute lecture. "

            "\u00a0Only if necessary towards major. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, great lecture class. I would recommend going to section as well. ",
            "\u00a0The classes are not very helpful so you will end up relying on the textbook anyways. ",
            "\u00a0It's a prerequisite and necessary for a multitude of majors so I don't need to recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course to anyone who needs it for medical school/their major. If you want to take the course to fulfill the science credit, there are definitely better classes to do that. While the lectures do help explain a difficult concept sometimes, reading the book is your best bet at learning all of the material. Recordings of the lectures and the lecture slides are always posted online just in case you miss a lecture. The discussion sections can be very useful depending on your TA. "
