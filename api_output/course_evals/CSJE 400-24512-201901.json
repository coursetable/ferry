            "\u00a0Gained a better understanding of current and recent American military engagements from a wide range of perspectives, including, especially, correspondence and interviews with people on the ground/in positions of authority during the events studied. ",
            "\u00a0Take a look at the syllabus, at the lesson points and the day-by-day overview, look over the readings, and then add 110 minutes of lesson. Add to that the cumulative life experience of all the people Professor Eidemiller has brought in to talk. You will learn more than you thought possible from a course at Yale; this is truly the most enriching class I have taken at Yale, both personally and professionally. It has also been my absolute favorite.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, I thought the lessons on junior leaders and SOF were really good, and the lesson on Counterinsurgency was extremely productive as well. The lesson on training and preparing junior leaders - thinking about lessons from coaching and West Point - are very strong and re-applicable for anything. I shared the life philosophy exercise with others in my residential college, my teammates in athletics, and several friends (I also shared the 4-quadrant strengths/weaknesses exercise) and we have implemented it into both our personal and our group initiatives. The lessons from SOF, particularly the readings we did, were productive for similar reasons; how do you take the lessons from various types of training and reapply them? How do different types of training isolate things to work on, think about how those things apply to you, and then improve yourself, even without having done the training? One of the Ranger School instructors explained how the food and sleep deprivation combined with the heavy stress of physical and mental challenges is meant to frustrate people, and good leaders must work through and around it or else that frustration destroys both the team and the success of the mission. \r\n\r\nThe counterinsurgency lesson was also interesting to learn about from a more military strategic/tactical point of view because I have studied it before from the terrorism/terrorist point of view (Cornell has a great class on the theory and practice of terrorism).  \r\n\r\nThe Special Forces and SOF lessons were great. I learned a ton about how the military actually worked on both a small and large scale.\r\n\r\nI can't even begin to detail everything we have learned in this class; needless to say, it is a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an exceptional job at introducing students to the tactical level of the military and how decisions higher up can effect them. Professor Eidemiller is an engaged and thoughtful teacher that made me a better writer and better public speaker. ",
            "\u00a0CSJE 400 taught me how to think methodically through case scenarios and organize my thoughts in a concise manner. I also gained super valuable insights into how the military operates and how leaders within it think. Overall a lot of new content and exposure for someone who is neither ROTC nor super knowledgable about the military, and was very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Learned real life experiences about the tactical and operation life of a junior military officer. Analyzed the diplomatic, low-level state building that is involved in the life of a junior officer while trying to conduct warfare. Realistic report/case study essay skills were developed through the papers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an incredible amount of insight in multiple arenas. Within the U.S. military, I learned about the leadership development process of young officers, gained the perspective of infantrymen on deployment, counterterrorism strategy, and much more on the conventional side. I also learned about unconventional warfare (Special Forces, SEALs, etc.), their recruitment/training, utilization, and tactics. Additionally, we also learned about the broader picture (civilian/military interagency, three levels of war, joint combat exercises, State Department, etc).\r\n\r\nI also developed my writing skills, including the art of concise writing. While many if my papers here have been long (and I've struggled to hit the word count, resulting in flowery, filler writing most of the time), this is the first course where I've struggled to stay under the limit. Forcing myself to cut unimportant lines, points, and arguments made my writing much more effective and concise. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about military leadership, challenges facing tactical leaders, and conventional and special forces' role in the global war on terror. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of tactical US warfare as well as how our military operates on the whole ",
            "\u00a0I gained A TON of knowledge about the military and all things related to the armed forces. I got a better understanding of what it is like to go through training to branches of the army like the Rangers and the Green Berets, as well as a look into the day-to-day occurrences of soldiers living and fighting abroad in places like Vietnam and Afghanistan. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about the american military's organization and structure, as well as the military experience. "

            "\u00a0Very engaging, I especially enjoyed the weekly speakers that were brought in, and case studies of various events. I wish we had had more guidance/clearer lead-up to the papers we wrote, though the writing lessons/feedback was very helpful. I also feel like the course could have been better organized so that we constantly referred to what we had studied previously-- there seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between concepts learned at the beginning of the course and those learned at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Frankly, I cannot find fault with any aspect of the course. I have given the professor feedback with suggestions, but there is nothing I would like to see changed, only things I'd love to see added to.\r\n\r\nA note: Professor Eidemiller struck the perfect balance in reading, assigning just enough that there was a lot of great preparatory material but not too much that it was demoralizing to try to complete it all. Generally, professors either assign so much that it's impossible to do it all (as someone who tries to finish everything, this is really frustrating) and then not have time to talk about everything, or they assign too little and other students start to see it as a gut, which means they don't prepare and the discussion is not as good. Professor Eidemiller hit the perfect sweet spot to avoid both problems; having more optional reading that was great for those of us who are really interested in doing more most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the readings selections are amazing, the guest speakers are well informed and great resources, great discussions weekly, super involved professor\r\nWeaknesses- none ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the coursework's organization and Prof. Eidemiller's enthusiasm, as well as the incredible speakers that he brings in. We were able to video conference with the Commanding General of the entire US Army Special Forces, as well as the Deputy Secretary of State at different points in the class. Almost every class towards the back half of the semester there would also be an in-person guest speaker who had extensive military service experience. Super cool insights and tie-ins across many fields.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement would be that most of the books we had to order off of Amazon - if it could be coordinated with the bookstore early on to stock them it would have been easier to buy them in one go. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was excellent. He has incredible knowledge and experience, and brought in guest speakers for every class so the overall wealth of knowledge of the course was immense. It was a very interesting topic that is not explored by other Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Eidemiller is the highlight of the course. A transitioning Special Forces officer and West Point grad, not only does he bring intellect and thought-provoking questions to the course, but his wealth of unique experience is unlike anything else offered at Yale. Readings are meticulously selected and are interesting and never feel like busy work (this is perhaps the first class where I've completed > 85% of the assigned readings). Essays and their feedback are a highlight as well - I was challenged to shorten my thoughts and arguments and make them concise as possible. I never felt like I needed to write filler nonsense to hit the word limit, as the prompts were challenging but fun, and the limits were short compared to most essays I've written. The constant feedback was a great help to me as well. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. There was a great lineup of guest speakers, and most of the readings were great. No major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher and engagement were strenghts. Course structure and lack of a core focus could be improved ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that it gives students amazing access to a world that most will not have the opportunity to explore in such depth. It was a really unique experience to hear from various career military personnel every day and to get an inside look into both the conventional and the special operations branches of the armed forces. Professor Eidemiller is so dedicated to the course, and he always comes to class prepared and ready to provide us with his decades of knowledge. The readings are all very interesting, so I definitely recommend getting through as many of them as you can, though we usually didnt spend much time in class actually discussing them. Also, Professor Eidemiller is willing to help his students with whatever they need. He has a ton of contacts in the military, so he can always connect you with people should you need more resources for your papers, and he is happy to clarify anything unclear regarding something from in class, the essay prompts, etc. He provides deadline extensions too, as long as you let him know several days in advance. As someone who had very little experience with anything related to the military prior to this class, I sometimes felt lost during class time because a lot of the acronyms and other concepts were not explained beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0I only have one downside to it: the reading load was heavy. Otherwise this was an incredible class and as a graduating senior, one of the best I have taken in my career here. ",
            "\u00a0Great course with excellent content. Only major drawback is how much content, if was scaled back ever so slightly would be even more phenomenal. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Long readings and 4 essays, which is adds up to be a fair amount, but all are much more interesting than most of the work I have for other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class has sincerely been my favorite (by far) at Yale. I have learned an incredible amount, enjoyed and learned from all of the readings, and loved the discussions in class. The guest speakers have been amazingly enriching to an already incredible experience. Professor Eidemiller is organized, clear, and highly productive in every single lesson, and the emphasis on lived experience both from him, the guest speakers, and our interviewees adds so much more. The essays themselves have been an engaging experience that I have learned a lot from. Everything we have done will be directly relevant to my future studies and other areas of interest, as well as to my professional future (note, I am not ROTC). I cannot thank Professor Eidemiller enough for the opportunity to take his course and for his time and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! This was the best class I have ever taken at Yale. The level of enthusiasm that Professor Eidemiller brings to this class is astonishing. He cares about his students and caters the class accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in understanding the environment, culture, and situations an individual serving in the military experiences and the ways and how the military, and especially someone who is interested in policy, this class is perfect for you. You learn about the impacts and consequences made through the decisions of policy and military structure through the perspective of infantrymen, and unfortunately it is a perspective that's commonly glazed-over or not considered. The class is also structured assuming students have no knowledge of military functionality and operations, so even if the topics seem intimidating Prof. Eidemiller really has the readings and guest speakers catered to all levels of experience in the military ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class if you're interested in politics in relation to the military, as well as major conflict-resolution oriented policy questions. Really informative and you'll learn a lot if you're engaged. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. If you are planning on going into the military, defense, the State Dept, or diplomacy, this low level diplomacy that is done in the modern warfare battle space is crucial for you to know. For many of the types of leaders that Yale produces, this is a very important aspect that will be an important part of their life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. 100% this is a gem of a class and perhaps the top class I've taken here at Yale. I normally never write this detailed of course evals, but I felt it would be a crime not to share how great this seminar is. It was not that much work - there are only four 1500-2000 word essays. Readings were not a lot of work either, and they were extremely interesting and well-picked. Eidemiller is a fantastic and friendly teacher, and hearing his experiences and gaining access to his vast network of contacts is alone makes it worth getting into/taking this class.\r\n\r\nHe brought in fantastic speakers, including a Navy EOD officer, State Department official, the USASOC commander, and multiple authors of books we read. This is a fantastic class that does not require a ton of work or time commitments. I thoroughly enjoyed every session, and even though it was at 9:15 it was definitely one of the highlights of my week. If you can get in, 100% take it, ESPECIALLY if you are interested in the military/public service. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the military, foreign affairs, or diplomacy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Eidemiller's dedication to making this course and experience is unparalleled! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent class. It's also an incredible opportunity to meet experienced and brilliant individuals in the military (ranging from lieutenants to a U.S. army lieutenant general), and ask them lots of serious questions! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about conventional and special operations warfare. If you are someone without any background of military knowledge, you may have to do some extra work, but it is worth it for all the unique points of view and expert knowledge you will have access to. Professor Eidemiller is a really kind and dedicated professor with so much wisdom to share, and if you follow his guidelines for the papers, you will do well. ",
            "\u00a0This is a must take. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Eidemiller is incredible and you should take the class just for the opportunity to learn from him. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the military, absolutely. You'll get more feedback and a more personalized experience from Major Eidemiller than you will from almost any other professor. "
