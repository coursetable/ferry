            "\u00a0This class should literally be mandatory for everyone who wants to graduate from Yale.  If Columbia can mandate that all students essentially take Directed Studies, Yale can mandate that all of its graduates have a basic understanding of ethnic studies.  This being said, the course spans far broader than simply ethnic studies.  Not only did ER&M 200 remind me of how much I love history, but it integrates studies of ethnicity, race, gender, capitalism, and critical histories from all corners of human society into a course that both is an expos of a fantastic major and far more comprehensive than even its very widely-encompassing name--\"Introduction to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration\"--suggests.  The course teaches lessons that many more technical courses at Yale tend to overlook--it eloquently and powerfully clarifies that all things have a history, and that these histories do not simply constitute the past, but in fact encompass our present.  Please take this class. ",

            "\u00a0I am so happy I took this course! Intro courses can sometimes be dull, especially because I had already taken a lot of ER&M classes, but this was not! The lectures and readings push you to think about all the topics in a really essential way, and by the end of the course, the learning was organized into four themes that perfectly encapsulated what we had learned.

",
            "\u00a0This course is the history you didnt get in high school. Aka, the history that matters the most. Please take this course! It gave me a comprehensive foundation of knowledge regarding how race came to be a social category and the different ways it is perpetuated and weaponized. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a broad overview of the discipline of Ethnicity, Race and Migration. I gained an understanding of the ER&M approach to analyzing primary sources as well as of the primary preoccupations of the field--genocide, human rights, colonialism, etc. As a woman and person of color, this course, with highly diverse enrollment, was wonderful because its material touched on my people's story. I learned so much about myself in the process. ",

Coming from a very conservative educational background, I felt like I relearned so many topics in American and world history from a completely different angle. This class just gave me a totally different way of interacting with and thinking about history. I also learned a lot of new skills for how to interpret and use a variety of sources in academic work, from writings to art to music. ",

I learnt a lot of basic historical knowledge about the US and the world, along with a method of questioning and challenging accepted norms that could otherwise go unchallenged. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with a lot of different media with critical and imaginative frameworks. I learned and unlearned, in that I acquired a broader and deeper understanding of the histories that produce our current context, and many different ways of coming to know and imagine those histories. I learned to do scholarly work with a keen awareness of my own history in relation to the work. I gained insight into the way in which legacies of colonialism, imperialism, and resistance have shaped everything from the built environment to the way I've learned to formulate thought and approach problems.

Professor Camacho is extraordinary and she brings in fascinating guest lectures. The TFs in Spring 2018 were also really excellent. If you don't think a lot about ethnicity and race, or even if you do, this class can change/challenge/augment your views in meaningful ways. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is a broad exposition of the entire Ethnicity, Race, and Migration program and makes an effort to cover as much subject area as possible.  This is both an asset and a complication of the course--the breadth of material covered is both mesmerizing and tantalizing.  Even after learning so much as part of the class, I am left wanting to learn so much more.  However, this incompleteness is intentionally embedded in the course as the titular \"Introduction\" offered by the course is meant to both inform and entice--an important function for an important program.  Professor Schmidt-Camacho also makes her devotion to social justice known through her work and her role as a professor.  Knowing the frequent inaccessibility of academia to its own students and those who seek its information (Yale is a fantastic place to see this problem in action), she strives to make the course both academically and materially accessible--as part of this, the readings are (1) profound, diverse, and engaging and (2) available as electronic texts on Orbis or as free PDFs in Canvas.  Please take this class. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of the course was that students were treated as equal intellectual partners with something to contribute to everyone else's understanding. Prof. Camacho often asked us during lecture for our perspectives on the primary texts or on the questions she brought up during lecture. A weakness was that lectures often operated on a level of sophistication that we found difficult to get excited about or be engaged with. The questions we considered were so broad and far-reaching that we sometimes didn't have much of an entry point. ",
            "\u00a0Good intro/overview course! ",

            "\u00a0I really liked that we had guest lectures from other professors in the department, because it helped me gauge whether I was interested in exploring ER&M in the future. I also really appreciated the breadth and depth of issues we covered, from the Bosnian Genocide to Slave Markets in Louisiana to postcolonial Jamaica. Professor Camacho was also such a wonderful, supportive instructor. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting concepts, interesting discussion sections, global playlist at the end of the semester is really fun\r\nWeaknesses: LOTS of readings (at least for me), lecture consisted of professor Camacho sharing her insights and explaining concepts that made it somewhat difficult for me to comprehend what exactly we need to know for exams/papers ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Camacho, the TFs, the lectures, the format of the course was very accessible\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were so wonderful, but many were too long to read comprehensively so I wish they had been a little shorter. Also, the global playlist event was too long - I think it would have been cooler to present in section and then the TFs could compile a song list and share it with the whole class so we could continue listening to the songs.

            "\u00a0This course I think covered many important issues and was a great introduction to the ethnicity race and migration major like it said it was going to be. I also think it was great how it was able to tie its topics of conversation to current examples. A weakness could have possibly been the order in which the topics went in, sometimes it wasnt very clear to me why it went that way. The guest lectures were also amazing. Additionally, I feel like this course made me more comfortable as a student because you werent focused on getting the grade you wanted since they werent harsh, it was easier to actually immerse myself in the course and internalize what I was learning because of that. ",

Professor Camacho's enthusiasm and respect for the material were a big factor in my engagement with the course. The Teaching Assistants were also clearly devoted to the curriculum (at least mine was). I also very much appreciated the guest lectures. They gave me an opportunity to learn about related faculty members and other approaches to the field of ER&M. Overall, the course seemed to have a lot of care given to its design. \r\n\r\nThe course's broadness is both a strength and weakness. Sometimes, when Professor Camacho/the guest lecturer presented us with a historical overview of a topic, it was hard to distinguish was merely important for background info, and which information tied into broader course themes like personhood, resistance, etc. ",

I think it might be my favorite course I've taken at Yale, and definitely one of the ones of I've learned the most in. Professor Camacho is truly the nicest and most caring professor I've ever had, and she's a great scholar too. The material is fascinating, although there's so much to cover, that you won't always have time to go as deep as you'd like. The assignments and exams are also interesting and thought-provoking. I appreciated how they were very fair, designed for you to share your knowledge and discuss what interests you most, rather than to stress you out. Overall, I just can't say enough things. Perhaps my only criticism is that the guest lectures sometimes didn't feel that connected to other things we were talking about, but at the same time I really enjoyed hearing from other scholars in the field.

I wish the lectures could've been a bit more accessible. These are ideas that, arguably, everyone should at the very least know about, but information on them is delivered in a way that's . .. arcane. \r\nSection could also be a little awkward, too, but I think that's almost inevitable. \r\nStrengths: \r\nA really forgiving course. Please hold onto this aspect. ",

It was sometimes difficult to fully delve into the nuances and intricacies of the material in the fifty minute sections, but still felt that we all gained so much from the readings' interactions with the content of Prof. Camacho's lectures. The guest lecturers also provided fascinating counterpoints to Prof. Camacho's style, broadening the scope of the course so richly. ",

I wish that more time had been spent in section as though some of the conversations had there were really great, we met for so little that it was difficult to truly establish the level of trust and comfort needed to form a grounded community that engaged such topics willingly and without self consciousness. I also sometimes thought the lectures could have benefitted by being only an hour instead of an hour and fifteen minutes. The readings were amazing though. I was almost always excited and captivated by everything I had to read for this class. It always left me thinking beyond the classroom. ",

Her lectures were each publishable in their own right. The only weakness of this course is that I wish I had three more years to engage more deeply with related materials and my peers about the subjects we discussed. ",

The class integrates a wonderful depth in engaging with cultural and ethnic studies and also forwards a materialist (i.e. class-based) analysis of history.  To add to the incredible depth and breadth of the course, the second half of the semester includes several guest speakers including in my semester Daniel HoSang, Inderpal Grewal, David Simon, Ana Ramos-Zayas, and equally fantastic scholars of ethnic studies and adjacent fields.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would because I think it is important for everyone to understand race dynamics in contemporary time in conjunction to historical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Professor Camacho makes this class amazing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I was engaged and very interested in the material presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Any student interested in ER&M should take the class. The course material is varied and interesting, lectures are interesting, and there arent too many readings. Professor Camacho is amazing and so kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! To echo the other evaluations, this is a must-take before you leave Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. I don't think that every class is for everyone, however. I recommend it to students interested in analyzing histories and narratives that have already been taught in schools from a different point of view. I recommend it as well to students interested in learning about universal themes--maintaining a sense of one's humanity in the face of grave violence and oppression, for example. I think this course is a must-take for all Yale students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Camacho cares about her students so much, and the TA's really want to facilitate student discussion about the course material. It gives you an incredibly new perspective about how to look at people of color, including the language we use when talking about marginalized groups and the way power persists throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0I can't recommend this class enough. If you can take it, absolutely do it, no matter what your major or your interests are. Don't be put off by the first few classes if you feel a little bored or overwhelmed. It takes a little time to adjust, but once you open your mind to this class, you will be amazed by the things you learn. I especially recommend this class for people who are not very well acquainted with or interested in the field of ER&M, because you will get the most out of it. You'll discover new ways of thinking and learning, and the ideas you learn will change the ways you think about many other things in your life. Seriously, if you're considering it, just do it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! So important for all students to have a basic understanding of ethnicity, race and migration. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone that doesn't really think too much race, ethnicity, and/or migration. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of whether or not you plan on majoring in ER&M, you should definitely take the course to learn more about processes and structures of racialization in a multi-racial, international context. Professor Camacho is incredible and this is a great gateway course for those who are interested in ER&M but also in learning more about the production of race in the United States and post-colonial territories. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the best ways to encounter Prof. Camacho's extraordinary scholarship and a thorough and potent introduction to the major strands of history, methodology, and social movements within ER&M. Touches upon everything from left economic theory to decolonizing language. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly think this class should be some sort of required class or distributional requirement. It is such a necessary foundation for being a critical and educated individual especially in the tumultuous political, environmental, and social state we currently find in the US, and arguably the world. It was a lecture so allowed arguably a level of lesser engagement than a seminar, but also had section where you could express personal ideas, and Professor Camacho did often make lecture interactive. A great fifth class, and a great class in general. Assignments were fair, self-driven, and enjoyable to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of the two best courses I've taken in my time at Yale. There are few courses that will not only change the way you think about your own political subjectivity and relation to the world, but also change the way you think about what how you want to shape your life in light of those lessons. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, for many reasons but, first and foremost, Professor Camacho! "
