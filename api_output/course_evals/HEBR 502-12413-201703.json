I thought it was unclear at times what the intended structure and content should be. In other words, I think it's wonderful that we partook in volunteering here in New Haven yet it was somewhat difficult for me to incorporate another organization in Israel in which I did not have the opportunity to volunteer in or gain a firsthand sense of its daily operation.
