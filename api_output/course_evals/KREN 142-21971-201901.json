            "\u00a0I absolutely loved KREN 142. If you're having any doubts on whether L4 is challenging or not - it is still work, but Professor Lee makes it incredibly enjoyable. I looked forward to Korean every single morning because of the fun and learning that I had. As a native speaker, you end up having a lot of conversations and discussions in class, and you improve your speaking skills a lot. The Korean class is also like a family - you end up becoming very close with your friends in the class, and Professor Lee is such an absolutely warm and caring person. ",
            "\u00a0Better writing, reading, and conversational abilities in Korean. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the Korean language in a more technical sense. My writing skills improved a lot and I also improved my speaking in that I was able to speak Korean beyond just a conversational setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the intricacies of the Korean Language and was able to gain a deeper understanding of Korean Culture as well. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Korean culture, and idioms. More focus on this, but also got corrections on spelling and grammar which I really needed. Class was taught really well and there was a lot of emphasis on learning vocabulary relevant for speech and debate during class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, write, and speak in Korean more fluently. The short stories we read were insightful about Korean culture and assignments such as writing poetry reflective of my inner thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop a more extensive understanding of writing styles and expressions specific to the Korean language. I also learned about a variety of values underlying Korean culture. ",

            "\u00a0A stronger vocabulary and furthering reading/writing skills ",
            "\u00a0KREN 142 improved my breadth of Korean vocabulary, my knowledge of grammatical conventions, and most of all, my ability to speak naturally in debates and conversations. Projects such as the spoken word poem and the tour video helped me to improve both my creative and formal writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop aural-oral and writing skills in a language learning environment adapted to suite the special needs of heritage language speakers. Furthermore, we performed a wide variety of tasks centered on expanding Korean cultural literacy and also spent time out of class engaging with Korean culture firsthand through the venue of weekly cooked meals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new vocabulary, idioms, sayings, and while reading folk tales and other short readings. I  was also pushed to write a good amount on these topics. ",

            "\u00a0If anything, I'd love to read more advanced Korean literature (books, magazines, newspaper) too. Besides that, this class was perfect and I loved every single part of it. ",
            "\u00a0A key strength is that the professor tries to have a real connection with each student. It was definitely nice to have that one class in which you can have casual conversations with your professor and feel comfortable enough to open up when difficult situations arose throughout the semester. Leniency based on circumstances was also very considerate in this course. A weakness I would say is that as more and more people are interested in the Korean language, the class sizes are getting bigger. Language courses are known for having up to 10-12 students, but our class had over 20 students. I would love if larger classes could be split up into two different classes. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how we incorporated resources such as folktales in order to gain a better understanding of Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths for the course include a fast-paced learning structure which allows learning of many new Korean vocabulary words, a mixture of students from various heritage backgrounds, and learning which develops relationships between students. I learned a lot of new expressions apart from what my parents have used and taught me. An improvement for the course would be to give more high impact assignments such as essays instead of many short writing assignments because large assignments would improve my learning faster and give more opportunity to show Korean language ability. ",
            "\u00a0This course did well in teaching in an organized manner (with regular feedback and updates) and diversifying the material. It could improve in terms of the level of interaction that the student is able to engage in a group setting. ",
            "\u00a0The clearest strength is the instructor, Angela Lee-Smith. She really pours out her heart to the students and caters to each student's pace. I felt at times that the course started to become unstructured, but that is just my preference. Some assignments, such as the video project, seemed more like busy work, but I appreciate her attempts to vary the type of learning in class. ",
            "\u00a0More structured classes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Lee-Smith is a wonderful instructor. She comes to class with such enthusiasm and care for her students - and even cooks for students every Friday! Many of the lessons help students learn not only about the Korean language but about Korean culture/history (folktale readings, interpreting commercials, Korean poetry, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the class debates could be on more relevant social/issues and topics, and sometimes the unstructured discussion time felt too long ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the course are the focus on cultural fluency in addition to language acquisition, the adaptable curriculum, and personal input from the professor. In terms of weaknesses, this course could be improved by having a more structured layout with more clearly defined goals. The class would benefit from having more sections and thus a smaller number of students per section because there could be more meaningful oral language practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lee, out TA, the amount of speaking practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not sure, good amount of work ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the weekly language table, as it was a great opportunity to practice Korean with classmates outside of the classroom. The homework assignments were generally engaging and helpful. However, some of the assignments were a bit tedious (putting together videos) and required the student to learn about video editing. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the learning of this course was amazingly high in a short period of time. Every day, students interact with different students in a large class size, so many different types of relationships are formed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to a student. It is a great means to learning about the Korean language and joining a network of faculty & students who share this same interest. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this class if you're a heritage (or qualifying non-heritage) speaker! Any class with Professor Lee-Smith is just outstanding. You will remember your Korean classes for the rest of your experience at Yale. \r\n\r\nAfter taking L3 Heritage Korean last semester, I became very insecure about my Korean speaking ability because of the toxic atmosphere of the class (I will attach my old evaluation for L3 Heritage taught by Prof. Seungja Choi below because last semester, the session closed on me and it didn't post). But in this class, Professor Lee-Smith really took care of every student and was patient with me, despite my own frustrations with my own language ability. Slowly I regained confidence to speak more assertively, despite my numerous mistakes made as I spoke. The environment definitely changed from last semester, since new students came in and ofc Professor Lee-Smith. The environment became a lot more relaxed and down to earth: people didn't care showing off their Korean skills (because there is a really big spectrum of levels in this class) and people became a lot more understanding about each other's struggles in with their heritage and language. Honestly, this class kinda felt like an AACC Asian American heritage discussion at times. People were so understanding and this really helped me regain confidence in where I am in my Korean language ability (fyi it's not the best). If you're insecure about your Korean language ability, I think this class will help you overcome your insecurities and give you confidence in who you are as a Korean. \r\n\r\n--------------\r\nAN EXCERPT FROM LAST SEMESTER (KREN 132 with Prof. Choi) TO CONTRAST WITH THIS CLASS\r\nThe class is great, but a recommendation is difficult to give. The class is not what it used to be. Now half the class are Light fellows, half are heritage students. The Light fellows want more speaking practice, but the heritage students want more grammar background (since they don't have much). This conflict of interests makes the class not too enjoyable at times, since it seemed like the direction was lost.\r\n\r\nHonestly, the class environment was pretty bad. Like a lot of the students were already close prior to class and they started making cliques, and these cliques would take up all the participation opportunities in class. Being a student from a English speaking heritage background, I often felt humiliated and looked down upon by my peers. At one point, I wanted to leave the class because the other students began using me as a ego boost. Since they were not of heritage background, they would often judge and make fun of my lack of Korean proficiency, often just to flex their own abilities. Because of this, it was very difficult to participate, and it only made my Korean worse over the semester. At the end of the semester, my friends were shocked how bad my speaking fluency was, since only 3 months ago, they heard me speak much better Korean. Yes, my insecurities in my Korean ability played a role in this consequence, but I think it is unacceptable for this kind of environment to arise in a language class. I mean it's L3! No one is fluent in Korean...\r\n\r\nIn the end, I learned a lot more about my insecurities and identity as a Korean-American rather than learning Korean. My identity and background was often questioned by my peers, and their ability to degrade someone's identity like that at a socially accepting and liberal place like Yale is amazing. If you're not of Korean heritage, please take this class as you can at least have the assurance that some other students who grew up around Korean speak worse Korean than you do, and at least you're better than they are. If you're nearly fluent in Korean, take this class for an easy A. If you're the rare case like me who have a Korean heritage background but are not that good at Korean, take another language or change your last name and tell everyone you're Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, given that the student belongs here in terms of korean ability ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are a heritage speaker who wants to improve speaking/writing skills! Being surrounded by other heritage speakers and having weekly speaking sessions really improved my speaking. Plus, Prof. Lee-Smith gives you a lot of spelling/grammatical feedback on your writing! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to heritage speakers of Korean who need a stronger base in grammar and written Korean skills. If the student already has a strong background in these areas, the course could be a bit boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is a great opportunity to develop a little more confidence in one's abilities in reading, writing, and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are heritage speaker. "
