            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful introduction to the hebrew poetry of muslim spain. Leaving the course, i truly feel like i can continue to read this poetry on my own having been given the requisite context and skills to do so well. ",
            "\u00a0My reading improved. And my sense of meter. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of Spain's religious and political history. I was also able to improve my skills of reading and analyzing poetry -Professor Cole does an exceptionally great job of correcting \"mis-readings,\" and helps students work through any confusion really well. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible and in-depth knowledge of the history of Muslim Spain and the time of convivencia; the techniques, styles, and motifs of Iberian Arabic poetry and the ways these poetics were copied and transformed by Jewish poets. Also, general methods of looking at poetry: form and meter, metaphor and language. "

            "\u00a0This course is one of the best I have taken at Yale. Professor cole is engaging and attentive, and the material is absolutely fascinating. The structure of the course (weekly responses for the first half of the semester, a midterm, presentation, and final paper) ensured that every student was on track with the rest of the class and able to follow and participate in the discussion. There really isnt anything Id change about this class! ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a weakness, to tell the truth. Except that I found the exam midterm to be less useful than a paper would have been, but that is a personal matter. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength of the course is its organization. For the first half of the semester leading up to the midterm, there were weekly assignments asking students to analyze the poetry using specific poems we had read in class. The assignments were challenging and often required a reasonable amount of time. But after the midterm, most of the class had significantly improved in the way they were talking about/writing about very dense, abstract poems. For the next half of the class, students \"presented\" on assigned groups of poems, taking on the role of discussion leader. This allowed for very interesting, lively discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible, incredible course. Highly engaging material with a professor who is excellent at transferring his knowledge and bringing students into their own. \r\n\r\nSomewhat unrelated to the professor, I thought the male students in the class sometimes dominated discussion and the classroom atmosphere. I think the professor could have perhaps guided conversation away from them sometimes. "

            "\u00a0YES. This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor cole is engaging and attentive, and the level of conversation is always high. The material is fascinating if you are interested in judaism, history, or poetry. A really incredible course! ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course highly enough. The material is fascinating and little known, but most importantly, incredibly well taught. Not only will this class introduce you to the rich and complex world of medieval Andalusia, it will teach you new and profoundly useful ways to think about language, poetry, religion, and cultural difference. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. A beautiful literary history. ",
            "\u00a0This class is absolutely extraordinary. Professor Cole invites you into the world of medieval Hebrew poetry in such an inspiring way. He's a superb teacher and translator, and it was so clear to us that he loved his work. I came away with a totally new set of skills and a brand new outlook on the world of poetry. If ever there was a mandatory class at Yale, this should be it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have interest in Judaism/religion, philosophy, or poetry then I absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Cole is an incredible, brilliant, and kind professor, and the material is new and constantly surprising. The class is also structured extremely well, and I always felt both supported and challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Do take this course! It's a niche subject, but the poetry is amazing! There's also no better person to take it with than Prof Cole. ",
            "\u00a0I want to counteract the wildly ethusiastic reviews... there are big drawbacks to reading poetry in translation, and to reading poetry so far outside the European tradition (it's written in Arabic literary forms). Talented teacher, though, and indisputably rich material... "
