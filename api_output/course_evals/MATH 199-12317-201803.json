In my opinion the questions that were presented could be more representative of the Putnam, because of this the questions became more about sudden inspiration, whereas the Putnam is about exploration. All in all I think there should be more emphasis on fewer problems during the class with additional materials for after/during the week. ",

However, solutions to problems were often not given, and students had to find them online themselves. I think it would be better for the instructor to give solutions to key problems and explain why they are instructive. ",

Even if you don't put much work into the class, at the end of the semester you come out with a packet of fun math problems to do on your own and the experience of participating in the Putnam. ",

Pat will become your fun uncle and you get an extra half credit to top-up that 4.5 you had to take for the language requirement. Plus there will probably be some free food at some point.

You have to take the Putnam which I guess is work, but why take the class if you have no interest in taking it anyways. Lots of fun, and Pat is the best. ",

It's like a crash course in proofs and number theory- the weekly homework is to attempt 2 problems we looked at in class (they're not graded, you just have to do it) and there is no final exam. You will be required to take the famed Putnam Exam at the end of the semester, but it's a really great course! Pat is a wonderful teacher. Very fun to learn from and very, very good at explaining mathematical concepts. Thank you, Pat! ",
