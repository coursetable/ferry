            "\u00a0This class gave me the opportunity to focus on my research while still fulfilling my academic requirements. I feel much more comfortable conducting independent experiments in lab now that I've had an entire semester to practice. ",
            "\u00a0I developed some important skills regarding research and presentation of research (in writing or presentation form). Through the research proposal and research report, this course offered a very hands-on approach to research in the lab. Since many of us aspire to work in the lab for a future profession, these skills were especially useful. Further, the feedback received during our assignments and presentations always served to improve my lab experience. My discussion with my PI and others in the lab helped me learn a great deal more and encouraged me to pursue more extensive literature review regarding my research project. ",
            "\u00a0It's a class that gives you credit for the research that you probably already do in lab, so what you get out of it is definitely highly dependent on your lab environment and PI. ",
            "\u00a0I learned important biology wet lab techniques, such as gel extraction, restriction digestion, and PCR. I also learned how to write a scientific research report. ",
            "\u00a0Biochemical lab skills "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the independence and flexibility it gives you. As a senior trying to fulfill all of my graduation requirements, I simply wouldn't have been able to focus on my research without getting academic credit. I also liked that the professors didn't try to assign papers or progress reports throughout the semester. Progress on my particular project came in waves. Sometimes I would make huge progress in a day, sometimes I would go weeks without a breakthrough. I appreciate that I was able to not worry about grades and focus solely on the research.\r\n\r\nThe only real weakness of this class is that it counts for 1 credit. 10+ hours per week is a lot of time, and doesn't seem comparable to a 1 credit lecture class that only meets for 3 hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the course's offering of college credit for researching in the lab. Indeed, I feel like research during the semester was often difficult but it helped me learn a great deal about time management in the lab and important skills for any researcher. One weakness might be the lack of interaction between students in the course, but I always managed to interact with other researchers in my lab. ",
            "\u00a0Affords sufficient independence and flexibility to students to focus on their research and working with their PI/mentors rather than having to focus a lot on completing course requirements. I would have liked to receive some feedback on my research proposal and on my experimental design/writeups from the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Really flexible with schedule, and it's nice that this year you have to write a proposal and final report and receive an individual grade for both components. Also, it forces you to give a lab meeting, which is an extremely valuable experience. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that we are allowed time to work in our labs and we can get credit for it. We also learn how to write scientific research reports and give lab presentations on our subject matters. It could be improved if we had more guidance when writing our research reports. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you're already involved in research this is a perfect way to get class credit while working on a cool project. Just remember that 10 hours a week is pretty large chunk of time, so it may be best not to take this class if you have a heavy schedule. I also wouldn't recommend taking this class if you're just starting out in a lab. I've taken this course twice now, with the first time being my first lab experience. It takes some time to get your feet wet if you've never done research before, and I probably would've been less stressed if I had started out by volunteering on my own time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is especially useful if you are planning to pursue research as a graduate student. Indeed, you will learn a lot about project proposals, planning, and presentation. In addition, much of the assignments are assignments that researchers typically do in the research setting (such as proposals and presentations). The assignments were an additional encouragement to engage more directly with research and stay engaged with my project. ",
            "\u00a0MB&B research for credit is a low-stress way to get credit + a grade and be encouraged to present and write up your research for the semester. Don't expect too much else in terms of assistance or feedback from the instructors, but it's great to take to satisfy electives while doing research that you probably would have done anyway if you're pre-med and/or going for a research career. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are doing research and would like to get some credit out of it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. You are allowed time and credit for the research you do in your lab. ",
            "\u00a0if you're working in a lab and are an MB&B major, research for credit is a great way to get credit for your work! ",
            "\u00a0A great opportunity to do research!  I also learned a lot writing the report. ",
            "\u00a0This is a continuation of the fall semester research for credit course. Nothing new to comment on here besides that you'll likely find that 10 hours isn't enough time to be productive in lab, so you should budget more time if you're serious about the project you're working on. "
