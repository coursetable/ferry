            "\u00a0I gained a very good understanding of the Hellenistic ethical debate, particularly of Stoic ethics. I also got a much better command of Cicero's Latin and was introduced to a lot of excellent secondary literature on Cicero's philosophy and on Hellenistic ethics generally. "

            "\u00a0This course was excellent, and I don't have many complaints. The Latin section in particular stands out to me as a clear strength, as it balanced linguistic and philosophical discussion very well. The one issue I found was that the student presentations, while all very good, often took up so much of the class time that we didn't really have the chance to discuss the assigned secondary literature or some of the other issues from the relevant section of the dialogue, but I understand that it's very hard to control for things like this. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this class a lot. \r\n\r\nOrganizing the course around \"De Finibus\" felt natural. \r\n\r\nDiscussions were calm and respectful. Compared to the other classes I took this semester, this was an oasis. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I was thrown off by sometimes was unevenness in the workload. I remember panicking when I sat down to do the Week Two reading and I realized it was like 200 pages - I totally hadn't set aside enough time. It would be helpful if Brad let us know when the reading for the upcoming week will be especially long. And if some parts are more important than others, it would be great to know ahead of time what we should focus on. Overall, though, the class was lovely. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, or one like it, to anyone who has a chance to take it. The framing of a philosophical debate through a close reading of one work that also brings in secondary literature for the debate in general is an excellent way to get a good handle on the issue. While I doubt that the exact work will be taught again in the same way, the De Finibus really gave me a renewed appreciation for Cicero's dialogue style, and how engaging and even funny a work of moral philosophy like this could be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The material is interesting, and Brad is a good teacher. "
