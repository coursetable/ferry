            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of Norse mythology and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I know so much about Norse mythology now! I also developed some idea of Norse people's lifestyles before and around the year 1000. ",
            "\u00a0LOVED ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I learn about Norse myths but also how to contextualize them in modern-day society. I also analyzed the significance and impact of each story in the backdrop of Norse society. ",
            "\u00a0Learned Norse mythology, how to consider writing in its historical and authorial context, and critical analysis of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Norse mythology more in-depth. I came into this class knowing an overview of the major events and stories of the mythology, and I was fascinated with how deeply we went into all the topics. Analyzing the original texts themselves was so different than casually learning the stories before, and it was incredibly enriching. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of ancient Norse culture and its mythology; analytical and reasoning skills; insights into the role of mythology in modern society; an ability to reconcile seemingly contrasting lines of evidence "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Too much of a focus on the modern context of the myths. I wish we focused more on the intellectual history and interpretations of the myths. I was left feeling a bit confused about how the myths were culturally significant because we didn't really get a knowledge of Scandinavian culture concurently with the mythology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small, lots of discussion, room for debates, student directed, paper feedback was amazing and useful\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes when students led discussions it was less organized ",
            "\u00a0Perfect ",
            "\u00a0The discussions in this seminar were pretty interesting. People had cool insights to share on their take of each story. However, Professor Fridriksdottir really made the seminar with her thought-provoking questions to get the conversation going. She provided a wealth of constructive points not only in the classroom but also during office hours when I needed to think of a topic for a paper and for the final. If anything, the weak link would probably be the seminar cohort. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course and well-structured to facilitate student learning: it starts out by introducing students to texts, discussing topics, and then - as students get more comfortable with the material - escalating difficulty such as asking students to lead discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely one that has to be a seminar, and it benefitted so much from that. Everyone had the opportunity to offer their own opinions and interpretations. The content was also very great. It's a very niche subject, so that means that everyone who takes this class genuinely likes it, which results in great discussions. I really don't think there was anything that needed to be improved, other than the fact that the projector in the room always caused difficulties. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading assignments are perfectly sized so as to allow the student to think and reflect on the texts in addition to doing the readings; class size is great, as it fosters personal relationships and ongoing discussions between classmates throughout the semester; the reading assignments are well-curated and lead to fascinating discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was hoping the class format would be a bit more varied (especially during the student-led classes) -- I find that even well-run discussions start to feel a bit repetitive after a while; the projector in BASS L73 is horrifically broken and the lights at the front of the room did not dim like the rest (not criticisms of the class, but the facilities which we had to use) ",
            "\u00a0The small class size really allowed for fun and very insightful discussion about the text. Also the readings were not very long so students could focus and think more thoroughly about it. "

            "\u00a0All-in-all, I love mythology. If you do too, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! If you have ever taken an interest in Norse mythology, please take this and learn even more. You will not regret it. This course is so engaging, and you will fall in love with the mythology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! So great ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend this course but ONLY if you really have an interest in Norse mythology. Think all you like about how this is the perfect humanities gut to add to your ever-growing collection of gut classes at Yale, but once you are in you must alight that thought from your mind immediately. Professor Fridriksdottir puts in a lot of care and thought into this class and does not need another deadweight dimwit contaminating the seminar space with their lackadaisical presence. Also, if you think waking up at 9am two times a week is easy, it really isn't. Don't expect to pull up in class ten past nine and expect someone to graciously fill you in on what you missed. Have some respect. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in mythology, take this class. Johanna is a very understanding professor and has a clear, passionate knowledge of her field. The class is well-structured to learn to read critically, but not in a strict and dreary way (in fact, I only say that in hindsight). Discussions will cover many themes and interesting stories, and the workload is not heavy. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Again, it is a very niche subject, but it is one that is very interesting. I find it interesting because a lot of the stories are ridiculous and make no sense, but we analyze why the stories are the way they are. It's different from the Greek mythology that people might be more familiar with, and it's so cool. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly ",
            "\u00a0100x over. Norse Mythology is fascinating not because it exposes you to a rich and vibrant culture which is woefully ignored in modern fantasy, but because it forces you to think about some deeply troubling and complex themes as you puzzle through the material. The things you'll read certainly aren't children's stories, but they're not like anything else you've probably read either. They very clearly raise questions about weighty topics like justice, sexuality, and fate, manifested alongside eight-legged horses and ships made out of toenails. Johanna is not only impressively knowledgeable and witty about little details that the first-time reader might fail to notice, but she's also so sweet and compassionate. Whether you're a Humanities major or this is your first writing class since high school, she is committed to helping her students realize their full potential and to getting as much as possible out of the class. Overall, it's well-taught and covers some very intriguing material, and I couldn't imagine a better way to spend one of my last semesters at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you're fascinated my the lore, ridiculousness, and societal context of mythology in general, I would highly recommend this course. "
