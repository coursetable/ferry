            "\u00a0I really developed my Italian vocabulary and grammar skills, as well as my reading, writing, and conversation abilities in general.  Before taking this class, I had no prior knowledge of Italian, so being able to now speak about many day-to-day topics at a reasonably high level is incredible.  In short, I learned a TON in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed conversational italian, including a wide variety of vocab across units and grammatical structure. ",
            "\u00a0I was not only introduced to the Italian language and culture, but I was able to improve my application and memorization skills. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read, write, and speak Italian at a beginner's level. I learned a great deal about grammar and proper pronunciation as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to listen to Italian better and pick up phrases while also learning to pronounce words correctly. ",
            "\u00a0A basic overview of Italian language, culture, customs, traditions, and the pleasure of taking a language course. ",
            "\u00a0I had no prior knowledge of Italian before I took this course, and came out with a very good understanding of the foundation of the language. In this course we not only delved into the language but also the culture of Italy, leaving the students with a deeper and better understanding of the course work. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are numerous: great professor, excellent textbook, fair grading policies and examinations, and just the right amount of coursework.  Any weaknesses this course may have had do not come to my mind - it was great. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to Italian. Although at times the vocab terms may seem like a lot per day, if you keep up with the work daily, it pays off. It's a fun class as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the unit based program with a mix of vocabulary and grammar per unit helped solidify a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class could get monotonous doing the same thing ",
            "\u00a0This course is very engaging and active with a strong mix of curriculum and its applications. It could be improved by better spacing out the sections with large amounts of vocabulary so it can be remembered over time. ",
            "\u00a0A main strength would definitely be Professor Farina. He was extremely engaging and pushed us to learn to the best of our ability. A weakness would be the fact that occasionally the class moves quite quickly, making it hard to stay current. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course and would not change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Farina was the main reason for why this course was so engaging, fun, and informative. The strengths were definitely how engaging the course was, how fun it was, and how it made everyone in the class excited to learn Italian. As for weaknesses, I'd say a greater emphasis on speaking would be nice, as that is one aspect of my learning experience that I wish I had more opportunity to improve. "

            "\u00a0Italian 110 was such a fun course and Professor Farina was incredible. If you can you MUST take it with Michael, he made every class exciting and helped us learn so much so fast. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in an Italian class that will bring you from knowing absolutely nothing to having hundreds of vocab words, many useful verbs (and their conjugations), and quite a few grammar tricks in your repertoire. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, especially with Michael Farina! It's a manageable class, and a good opportunity to contribute to your language requirement. ",

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY, ESPECIALLY WITH PROFESSOR FARINA. It's a great, fun, instructive class on Italian language and culture. The workload isn't bad at all and the material is so much fun. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE. I took a risk by switching my academic language and it greatly paid off. "
