            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about moral psychology and major themes in the field, which also encompasses moral philosophy, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology and other elements of social psychology. I also gained exposure to psych studies and learned about different ways to analyze human behavior and make sense of data to support particular findings. Most interestingly, I learned a lot about the psychological mechanisms that explain the gut feelings and attitudes humans have in their everyday lives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how we think, why the world works the way it does, and how to think critically about the way our psychology influences our actions. I learned how to argue my opinion more effectively and engage in educational discourse. ",
            "\u00a0An extremely wide yet through look into moral psychology - many of my pre-existing notions about morality were rightfully challenged. I've came out the class with much more knowledge and a greater perspective on how to use rationality to become a better person. ",
            "\u00a0I learned everything and more than I expected to in Moralities of Everyday Life. I was able to explore moral philosophy from a myriad of angles, think about myself and my own choices/behaviors/opinions, and think about how the world is progressing/progress more. I was challenged to write about philosophy/psychology separately, and write about what overlaps between the two. This is the best course I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how we think about morality and how we arrive at these decisions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about human moral psychology. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was great, as every week had a different overarching theme but the weeks all intersected and built off each other. We spent a helpful amount of time discussing the counterarguments to every major theory, and got a nice overview of many different parts of the field. It was a lot of material to cover in 5 weeks, especially considering not every reading got much discussion time in section, but was overall pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was absolutely fantastic. It was difficult to do well because of the past of a summer course, but the topics were connected as well as they could be considering the time constraint and class discussion never failed to be fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Long-running course with enough trial and error to make it well-run\r\n-Great personable TFs and professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Limited interaction and awkward video seminar format\r\n-Lateness of reading response grades and not enough feedback on progress ",
            "\u00a0Only two weaknesses were 1) that it took forever to get reading responses back. By the time they were back the course was almost over. 2) We didn't read a lot from women or POC. Would have liked to hear more diverse perspectives. Strengths: PAUL BLOOM ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are very interesting and fun to read. Additionally, it was great to have so much interaction with Professor Bloom and the TAs. I think the course could be improved if we got our reading responses back sooner because by the time I got my first feedback I had already written 3 or 4 responses and wasn't sure if I was headed in the right direction. ",
            "\u00a0More philosophical, instead of scientific references. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any and all other students. It's really interesting to learn about moral psychology, and these lessons are absolutely applicable in everyday life  both for our behavior and our background understanding of the different moral tensions and predispositions at play. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone who is interested in learning about how the world works and why it works the way it does, or is just interested in having great discussions should take the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great introductory psych or philosophy course; practical use in everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Amazing and stimulating summer class. You WILL think about the world and yourself differently and become more mindful about everything that you do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think everyone should take this course regardless of his/her major. Morality is highly tied to how we navigate our lives -- personal relationships, social issues, politics -- and I think everyone should have this opportunity to learn about different moral systems and reflect upon his/her own morality. I also think this course is great for self-reflection on how we interact with other people and have different codes of behavior for different people depending on what we view as our moral obligations to them.

            "\u00a0Yes, interesting material, engaging discussions "
