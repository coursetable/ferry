            "\u00a0The basics of Spanish is taught in this course. Nine different chapters worth of vocabulary, as well as dozens of grammatical constructs such as present-tense and past-tense conjugation, direct and indirect object pronouns, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a thorough foundation of the first level of spanish. I also learned how to study and learn a language effectively. ",

            "\u00a0The class moves much faster than any high school course and having the class in Spanish everyday makes you learn extremely fast.  The process of learning in class and then doing extra activities daily outside of class is really effective as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very thorough foundation of spanish.\r\nweakness: course moves too quickly considering the class if full immersion. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Lourdes Sab. She is a wonderful instructor who really cared about the development of each student in the course. Through in-class exercises and the occasional hot-seat moment when Professor Sab calls on students at random, the course really helped me develop a confidence with speaking a new language. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if that student understands the time demands of the course outside of the class. ",
