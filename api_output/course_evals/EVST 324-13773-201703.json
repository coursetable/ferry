            "\u00a0I learnt about environmental justice in South Asia from an interdisciplinary perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating overview of India's environmental history - particularly rich with regards to India's history of environmental jurisprudence and activism within the legal system. The central focus of the course, 'environmental justice,' forces you to try to triangulate scientific knowledge, social justice, and a range of formal political/philosophical thought in a manner that no one was particularly accustomed to, but I think everyone benefited from. Honestly just a really extraordinary way of approaching a region and a set of social aims. Also got to read some incredible books - ethnographies of infrastructures, for example - that I would have never encountered elsewhere but indelibly altered my understanding of cities, rivers, etc. ",
            "\u00a0While taking this course, I developed critical reading skills as well as discussion skills. The course challenged me to \"check\" my perspective as an American student, who has had no prior experience with South Asia. It was difficult at first to do so, as I wanted to draw parallels. These parallels were ultimately beneficial to help me understand the content as a whole, but I believe I would have learned more if I had a connection to South Asia. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an exceptional interdisciplinary look at the social and ecological challenges facing South Asia, ranging from land use to forest management, resource extraction, megaprojects, disaster response and moreall within a critical framework of colonization and class relations. It was wide-ranging in focus but clearly allowed students to dig into deeper awareness of the social conditions that shape ecological issues in South Asia. All around excellent addition to the undergraduate curriculum that serves both those interested in South Asia and those interested in environmental politics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a pretty broad knowledge of environmental problems and their uneven and unjust impacts across the Indian population. The class went through a range of cases from multiple perspectives, which enabled me to develop the skill to critically evaluate the environmental discourses of elites and poor people. I also got significant direction and feedback on the research paper and exposure to the field of environmental anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major environmental justice issues facing the Indian subcontinent, the discourses surrounding them, and the histories of each. This course also introduced me to thinking about  current environmental issues in the context of colonial history and colonial influences. We discussed the mechanisms by which various environmental injustices have come about, as well as the challenges and questions associated with solving them. "

            "\u00a0A truly fantastic course! I would have loved to have the opportunity to discuss my writing with my peers in a workshop setting more often. ",
            "\u00a0As with any class named after a concept that is hard to define, we had a tendency to get bogged down in competing conceptualizations of 'environmental justice.' Sometimes I doubt that these discussions lend themselves that much to the consideration of reality/social contexts/the ways in which people conceptualize their own work towards an end. However, Luisa and Shivi were extraordinarily good at directing these discussions back towards the case-studies and then opening them up. The readings were incredible - particularly the urban political ecology - and built on one another to cumulatively propel us through these questions with a sense of urgency and materiality. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest weakness of this class was that there was so much reading. Although the reading was interesting for the most part and provided a lot of content, it became too much. Class discussions never felt unified which I found to be very frustrating. I was also frustrated when I couldn't see the connections between the various reading each week, which occurred because we became very focused on one aspect of the reading during our discussions. Due to this singular focus discussions turned into a lecture by Professor Sivaramakrishnan. \r\n\r\nOne of the class' strengths is how the first and last lesson mirrored one another, as we focused on the Anthropocene. It was interesting to see how our perspectives changed once we came full circle; despite the fact that it felt like a very convoluted circle. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting class and readings! A better balance of lecture and discussion could be achieved. Despite this being a seminar, often most of the time was spent as if in a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar was in its first year of existence and therefore had a few kinks to workout, so my feedback is coming from an overall love and appreciation for the class and our professors, but with just some points about how it could have been improved. The balance in class between reading discussion and lectures from Sivi and Luisa was sometimes tricky to managetheir vast knowledge was incredibly mind-expanding but also could leave readings underexplored and insufficiently mined for content. The discussions on canvas fixed that to a certain extent and there was good back-and-forth there, but also I was sometimes unsure how much effort to put into those reading responses so a little more clarity around how exactly that system should work. Also, the readings were amazing but also very long. I wonder if we could have had excerpts that reduced the page count while focusing in on the most important sections (I realize that fine-grained ethnography is part and parcel of upper-level anthropology, but at least the intentionality behind the readings should be out in the open). These tweaks could make the class stronger in future years but it was definitely powerful as is! ",
            "\u00a0This is perhaps the most tragic and disappointing class I've taken at Yale. I say this because the subject material is extremely interesting and meaningful, and the professors are both supremely knowledgeable. However, I was never very excited or engaged in the class because of the pedagogy and the way the material was presented.\r\n\r\nI took the class because I was really interested in the subject, not for my major or any distributional requirement. The readings were really interesting, if a bit dense and hard to understand, and at first I was really excited to come to class and discuss. However, we rarely had a chance to have seminar-style discussions, despite the fact that the student-faculty ratio was 5:1 (ten students and two professors). The first half or more of the class was a lecture by one of the professors, which would be followed by a \"discussion.\" I put that word in quotes because the professor set things up so that the discussions went as follows: the discussion leader, a different student each week, would talk about their thoughts on the reading for five to ten minutes; next, the professors would usually respond for five to ten minutes; after that, maybe two to three other students would make comments, and then inevitably Prof. Sivaramakrishnan would monologue for another 10 minutes about subjects often unrelated to the readings before students got a chance to air questions or respond to their peers again.\r\n\r\nThis form of learning deeply frustrated me. The things Prof. Sivaramakrishnan would say were sometimes interesting and valuable, but the degree to which he dominated the discussion seriously stifled student thought. In the first few weeks, I came in eager to bounce ideas of my classmates and the professors and make sense of the readings. However, over the course of the semester, I came to realize that I likely wouldn't have chance to discuss the readings with my classmates. It could just be that my preferred learning style, which entails students taking an active role, wasn't reflected in this class, but it could work well for other people. For me though, the class was deeply disappointing and frustrating.\r\n\r\nTellingly, my favorite part was the independent final research project. I thought the professors were both very helpful in providing us with resources and guidance throughout the process. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great in terms of breadth, but perhaps could benefit from an improvement in depth. We covered a variety of environmental issues such as large development projects, urban pollution and sanitation, the damming of rivers, forest and wildlife conservation, etc. However, the course could benefit from a better organization of these topics into a more cohesive whole. While each unit itself was interesting, the topics did not necessarily build on each other to produce a continuous framework of knowledge. While it was clear that the different issues were related, the connections between them could have been more clearly communicated and emphasized. This would help students come away with an understanding of how each week contributed to answering a greater overall set of intellectual questions regarding environmental justice. In other words, it would help if the individual sessions of the seminar were more directly related to the the goals of the course (which were really great on the syllabus). In essence, a stronger conceptual framing of the discussions and the readings would be useful.\r\nAlong these lines, the readings each week--though strong in content--were often too much and somewhat disjointed even though they were about the same topic. The course would benefit from having fewer readings in order to build more depth and cohesion around each one, and therefore also around the topic that a given reading has. There were many instances where I wished we would simply read all of a book that we were assigned one chapter from, instead of reading a bit from here and there. In one of my previous anthropology classes, this approach (reading one whole work each week and discussing in depth) led to very rich discussions in which the whole class was on the same page. It also allowed us to analyze methodological issues, which I wish we had done more of in this course.\r\n\r\nIn terms of strengths, both instructors were enthusiastic, highly knowledgeable, and accessible; the topic of the course is compelling and timely. The instructors did a nice job allowing for intellectual exploration and student-driven learning. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! It provides an interdisciplinary lens with which we can assess an important issue of our time. The focus on South Asia is great for those passionate about the region, but also great for those who want to learn more about it. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in questions of environmental justice, activism, or policy and/or in the region of South Asia. It's particularly pertinent for those seeking an interdisciplinary approach that's rich in analysis and grapples with 'bourgeois environmentalism' - i.e. a necessary remedy for those of us studying EVST at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to upper-class individuals who are very interested in both environmental justice & South Asia. I would not recommend taking this course if you don't have much background in South Asia. When taking this course I felt at a disadvantage because I had no prior knowledge of South Asia, and believed I was able to use it as a case study. In some ways, this worked and in others, it didn't. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very important topic and great paradigms introduced. Professors are also super helpful and intelligent. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an exceptional interdisciplinary look at the social and ecological challenges facing South Asia, ranging from land use to forest management, resource extraction, megaprojects, disaster response and moreall within a critical framework of colonization and class relations. It was wide-ranging in focus but clearly allowed students to dig into deeper awareness of the social conditions that shape ecological issues in South Asia. All around excellent addition to the undergraduate curriculum that serves both those interested in South Asia and those interested in environmental politics. ",
            "\u00a0If you're just looking for an interesting seminar, there are better classes to take. If you're in Energy Studies or EVST, though, this could be one of the more critical and thought-provoking classes you can take to get credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course overall, though I think it could benefit from some improvements. The readings and topics in the class are a little bit disjointed, and it would be beneficial if the instructors provided more direction for the discussions. This would help us feel like we are building a cohesive overall understanding of environmental justice, as opposed to simply studying select issues of environmental justice.\r\nIn other words, the course is a bit too light on drawing theoretical/broader implications from the case studies (even though much of the readings are ultra abstract and discursive in the way that anthropology tends to be). At the same time, the reading assigned for each case issue in environmental justice is too much, and I think some quality was lost for the sake of quantity.\r\nIf these issues can be addressed, I think the class would be really great and I would wholeheartedly recommend.\r\nAs it is now, the course was still a positive experience in educating us about the most relevant environmental issues in South Asia and some of the discursive elements and histories surrounding them.\r\nBoth instructors were very open, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable.
