            "\u00a0Yes I would, this class offers a great application of using research. You get to dive deep into a period of history and try to understand what the world looked like. The class teaches the importance of good research because your set design relies on it.  It is also interesting see how everyone can create such different sets with the same play, themes, and historical information. "
