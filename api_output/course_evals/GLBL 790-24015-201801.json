            "\u00a0I certainly learned and developed a basic understanding of contemporary leadership theory through the lens of historical and contemporary case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Although not new to leadership, the practice of leadership is never over and this class helped me reevaluate my personal leadership style. ",
            "\u00a0Developed personal insights through working with a diverse and driven group. Had interesting discussions with different people ",
            "\u00a0The easy part about leadership is leading by example with integrity, and taking ownership of failures.  These should be  automatic virtues any leader possesses, or else they will not be seen as leaders by those who follow.  The hard part of leadership, which this course focused on, was building consensus, understanding power dynamics, making compromises where necessary, properly diagnosing problems, and navigating complexity.  I learned to understand these more subtle obstacles leaders face and how they have been dealt with throughout history.  The crisis simulation was a highlight for me, in which I saw how leaders must control information flow in meetings, while demanding concise and digestible information from subordinates, in order to meet the intent of their leader.  I also gained great insights on opinions and worldviews from an extremely diverse and fascinating group of classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Dear Chris and Stan,\r\n\r\nI hope you are having a great weekend. The last session of our class felt to be too soon, as is the case with all the good things  they come to an end too early, and time flies leaving no clue for us to know how it passed so swiftly. However, referring to my self-reflective story, I wrote for our recent assignment, my most important challenge has been overcoming the inner inertia that has accumulated in me during the past years due to my specific conditions. Those two early morning runs touched something within me. The last dawn I had run was 17 years ago while I was in our secondary schools soccer team  just a few years before my movement disorder symptoms kick in. I heard a reminder ringing just next to my ears once again in my life, that I should wait less, I should do more while there is still time.\r\n\r\nThis is how the last session felt to me, and I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to be in this course and to sit with all the great souls and get to know them.\r\n\r\nChris, I missed the chance to see you and say goodbye, although I am sure that our paths will cross again. I am keeping on building the habit of waking up at 5:30  though being far from that yet!\r\n\r\nIn our last session, Kyle showed us his wrist-wear which belonged to a dear friend he had recently lost. This was how Kyle would motivate himself to wake up at 5:00 am; by looking at this wrist-wear, and feeling grateful that he has the chance to start another day, to be here and alive! His story moved me, and will stay with me, as same as all the stories and personal experiences I learned from both of you, and from everyone in our class. This is an invaluable gift that I am taking from our course. And I dont want to emphasize on the word course or class too much, because I feel that we all actually lived together for a brief but intense and rich time. I am wholeheartedly thankful for all the support and the constructive energy you put in our time. This is to be remembered.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nAslan ",

            "\u00a0The course offers a glimpse into the incredible experience of Gen. McChrystal and his colleagues as well as practical applications of the theory that he aims to impart on us. The course feels a bit like a sprint at times as the schedule was quite condensed. Additionally, the discussions and debates sometimes went on tangents that left less time to dig into the cases. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: faculty commitment, speakers, depth of discussion, off-sites.  Weaknesses: Some students continually hijacked the discussions to further their personal agendas to the detriment of the overall class...in retrospect both the class and faculty should have stopped this dynamic earlier the semester. ",
            "\u00a0We didnt talk about any leadership theory - mostly only case studies of executive level leadership. You can make the argument that leadership is the same at all levels, but the techniques and dynamics at the level Yale students will be at upon graduation is very different from what we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0More class time and limiting class time to discussion rather than teaching. We have very little time for discussion in the class so using that time geared towards interacting with each other would be great. Would also like to hear more feedback on performance generally ",
            "\u00a0I love the wide variety of students taken from all across the University to include the College.  I think we have a lot to learn from each other regardless of age and perspective, and we benefited from a large cross section of students - I think the current mix is about optimal.  Other strengths were the two field trips that helped us bond.  Overall the reading list was excellent and offered a range of different leadership challenges.\r\nTwo improves I would make - I wish we had more time to discuss \"Team of Rivals\" - given the investment of time to read the book, I felt that in that class we got side-railed by other conversations less relevant to Lincoln and the book. It is such a complex story I would have liked to have talked more about Lincoln's political tactics in deeper context.  Another aspect I would have liked to see discussed was the discussion of the Global Financial Crisis.  \"Too Big to Fail\" by Aaron Sorkin was on the reading list but we didn't get to it in class. It is a fantastic book and an important story that represents some of the greatest cumulative leadership failures in American corporate history that are worth examining.  The Enron story might also be an excellent corporate leadership case study for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class and Im extremely glad that I had the opportunity to take it. I will use the lessons I learned here the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nIn terms of scheduling, I thought the classes were spaced too closely together. Though obviously possible, properly doing a close-read of the assigned materials for three classes in one week can present a challenge. Furthermore, I think such a compacted schedule may have made class bonding more difficult. Though I know the schedule is determined by availability and perhaps not much could have been done, I wanted to point it out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if something like this happens again you could have the class go on more bonding trips. Maybe to an obstacle course or an escape the room.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought this was a great class, and Im grateful for the opportunity to learn from such inspiring people. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Again, the volume of expertise in the room is profound. Likewise, the General and his colleagues are very approachable and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student genuinely interested in being a leader. ",
            "\u00a0No. You learn a lot about leadership in the first three lessons when Stan threatens to yell at us all if we dont do the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is an incredible opportunity to take a step away from the normal academic focus of courses at Yale and be able to discuss a topic, leadership, that permeates across all disciplines. Gen. McChrystal and Mr. Fussell hold the class to a high standard but in exchange are forthright in their analysis and experiences, which is incredibly instructive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- great course to meet other people, discuss interesting real life scenarios and read very useful texts ",
            "\u00a0Certainly a highlight of my time at Yale.  Offers exposure to topics, readings, discussion, and speakers rarely seen in a course.  Blunt, honest feedback provided by instructors and all members of the class were held accountable for all course materials which is refreshing to see here.  Great social opportunities and a chance to meet more students from across the University and a wide variety of backgrounds that you are unlikely to see in any other course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The ability to spend a semester reflecting on the qualities of excellent leadersled by two excellent leaders themselveswas an incredible experience. Dont take this class expecting a checklist of traits that make good leaders. Do take it if you want to spend a lot of time reflecting on how you can lead in your own life and meet some awesome students along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course, not only to those interested in leadership, but also to anyone who aspires to improve their teamwork skills and professional effectiveness. This course is also a personal journey, as much as it is a collective experience, which embeds the mindset of reaching for excellence through commitment, acceptance of failures and embracing the challenges. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. I think I leaned a lot both from the teachers and the students, who are drawn from across the university. ",
            "\u00a0Not based on my class experience this semester. However, I've heard that this course fared better in previous semesters. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were introspective, and the detailed feedback provided by the instructors was very helpful. However, the assignments were not really related to the class itself. \r\n\r\nSeveral things can be improved:\r\n\r\nThe class schedule was unhelpful: we wouldnt meet for several weeks and then we had several instances of three classes in one week. While we knew of this schedule in advance, going through it was tougher than expected and came at the expense of other work those weeks.\r\n\r\nModerating of class discussion was surprisingly missing even when conversations had become painfully superficial and irrelevant to the topic at hand.\r\n\r\nThe leadership case studies were interesting but drew out basic lessons on leadership tactics. The focus seemed to be a broad introduction as opposed to in-depth evaluation of the more nuanced and interpersonal aspects of the various leaders under study. Further, the sheer quantity of the readings assigned did not foster engaged reading or stimulating class discussion (a significant portion of the class was spent on just summarizing the numerous readings). \r\n\r\nApplications are part of many Yale classes. However, the emphasis on treating this class as a privilege (we were often reminded about the competitive application process) was unnecessary and almost counterproductive. It seemed to imply that we had to put this class over everything else, which just made even its small organizational shortcomings stand out more: from discussion questions being disseminated hours before class despite the class having not met for weeks, some guests showing up to lectures without much context, to not all students having an proper opportunity to present in class for an assingment explicitly designed to be presented/shared with the class!
