            "\u00a0Grew in so many ways. Somehow through these four assignments, I've learned so many things. Spatial thinking improved, overall approach to design improved. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to come up with our own designs and styles and how they relate to the different scales of the world, also how to use many of the amenities in the architecture building to create our projects ",
            "\u00a0This course serves in many ways as an introduction to technical skills used in the architecture program (laser cutting, 3D printing, photoshop, indesign etc.). It also serves as an introduction to the architecture school building, to one's peers who are also interested in pursuing architecture, and to the structure of many architecture classes with pin-ups and reviews. ",
            "\u00a04 large design assignments that build upon the readings and smaller exercises ",
            "\u00a0What I most took away from this course were the practical skills I learned like how to use Rhino, Photoshop, and other software. I don't think I learned anything about architecture or design. ",
            "\u00a0Different means of representing ideas and different skills for creating those representations. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about photoshop, rhino, graphic design ",
            "\u00a0This introduction to the architecture major has made me incredibly excited to pursue this field of study. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so different than any other course I have taken at Yale. It allowed me to be creative and think completely out of the box about human life and architecture on various scales. ",
            "\u00a0How to build stuff. How to build stuff late. How to build stuff that means stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Great class for architecture students to push their creativity and innovative skills. ",
            "\u00a0My understandings of what architecture is, what/who humans are, and what the world is like were all expanded upon and challenged in this course both through lectures and exploration through projects. The subject matter of this class is not just architecture and the built environment in the conventional understandings in the field, but is more an exploration of human experience and impact. I learned that architecture isn't just confined to buildings, but is everywhere from our clothes to power lines. \r\nYou also learn through the assignments in class what it is to design. From initial concept, to process, to execution, and to the final product, I learned what it's like to be at each step and the type of problem-solving and physical effort it requires. I also learned what it's like to be in a studio-type class and environment and have gained experience in reviews and critiques. As for hard skills, I learned novice skills in Rhino and Adobe suite. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course, I gained a better understanding of  the relationship between humans and the the environment. I was able to critically think about the different scales through which humans experience the world and how design plays a huge factor in such experience. ",

            "\u00a0More guided projects, ie less vagueness ",
            "\u00a0Really high workload, should be a 1.5 credit course, but definitely one of my favorites ever at Yale. Very rewarding + the class becomes a small community, it's really quite lovely. The TAs are KEY, they made the course so doable and just so much better in general. They made a book! of all of our works! So kind. Schedule of work should be made more clear so that students don't end up cramming everything into a one week/weekend. The four design problems were all kind of confusing at the start, but were intellectually rewarding in the end. Really loved the set up of the last critique, which was in Silliman's Maya's Room. Wish we got more feedback on our progress in the class. ",
            "\u00a0the class is a lot of work if you really want to make it meaningful and develop your own style, but its what you put into it. You really have a lot of space to be creative which is great and the class has a really great environment. ",
            "\u00a0The course does introduce students to a number of incredibly useful programs/skills needed for the architecture major (photoshop, illustrator, laser cutting etc) as well as allows students to become acquainted with the structure and feel of architecture courses with pin-ups and reviews. That being said I really wish there had either been more instruction on these programs or somehow more time given for students to learn these programs. Often, for each project it felt like students were thrown into the deep end and expected to learn programs on their own very quickly ",
            "\u00a0a very engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of the course are the lectures. I honestly cannot say a single thing I learned or took away from one of the lectures. They were so long with so many images that it was incredibly difficult to synthesize the information that was being presented to us. I felt like they were almost not essential to the course and it would have been fine without any lecture time. The projects for the most part were enjoyable, but they often lacked a clear sense of purpose or direction. Yes, it was nice to have creative freedom, but when the assignment is something like \"make a panorama of a city\" there are so many areas and facets to be touched upon it is difficult to actually something constructive and concrete. I definitely would have liked some more clear guidelines on the projects to make it more of a design project versus just arts and crafts. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work ",
            "\u00a0I think the level of production for this course was both its strength in that it challenged myself and others to create unexpected work and its weakness in that it kept us from engaging as fully as we needed to with the non-production related parts of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the tutorials for how to use rhino and photoshop could have been more thorough and comprehensive. I often felt that we went too fast. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly demanding course which is pretty much a semester long trial by fire. Manageable only due to the kindness and brilliance of bimal and the tas. Would benefit from a little more focus. Readings were great but our discussions about them lacking. Would have been nice to do a half lecture/half seminar style class on Thursday. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures, although interesting, couldve been shortened at times so there was more time to discuss assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments and the way they build up in scale are incredibly well designed for learning and further improvement. Lectures were also very interesting, but sometimes could feel very long and irrelevant if the ideas in the lecture weren't clicking with me or I just didn't fully understand them. Some section meetings were more helpful than others. ",
            "\u00a0I sometimes wish the lectures could be delivered with more concrete takeaways. "

            "\u00a0yes, but especially if for your major; but I wouldn't  just take it for fun because its a lot of time commitment and you should be really into it to be successful ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend this course to anyone interested in architecture/urban studies (granted if that is the case, its required for those majors!). Many aspects of the course are great! You become acquainted with many valuable technical programs (laser cutting, photoshop etc.), the architecture school itself, and you get to know all of the other students in your year who are interested in the same major. But the workload for the projects is incredibly high - you have to spend a large amount of time every couple of weeks to learn new programs that the course expects you to use for projects but does not provide much guidance on (although the TAs are wonderful and a great resource when you are struggling!) ",
            "\u00a0It is a gateway into architecture and an introduction to what a studio environments is like ",
            "\u00a0No unless you are an intended architecture major. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to students interested in architectural design. ",
            "\u00a0Yes learned a lot of skills ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think scales of design is a rare opportunity to work with one's hands within the framework of artistic and philosophical framework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely whether they are an architecture major or not. ",
            "\u00a0Required for arch, buckle up. In seriousness, it's a really special class. Nothing like it before. You make many friends and learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to people interested in majoring in architecture because otherwise youre not going to want to put in the amount of work that it requires. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to any student, Architecture major or not, also Sophomore or not, that is interested in design in any capacity. It's a lot of work but it's fun for those who like making things and want to be exposed to a studio-style class but can't actually take Junior Design Studio with the Arch. major. Again, it's a lot of work and will be a commitment, but I think it is incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students because it has a unique learning style that other classes at Yale do not have. The hands on work and the chance to use your creativity is something that I found made the class extremely interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Hahahahah if you wan't to do architecture you don't have a choice lmao. But honestly, it's an essential part of your education as someone who cares about architecture.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to do architecture, there are other courses that will scratch the design itch that are less work-intensive.
