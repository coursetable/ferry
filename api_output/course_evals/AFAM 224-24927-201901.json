            "\u00a0The course took a really interesting approach to political, legal, and social activism through the lens of athletes. I learned a lot about what types of events become impetuses for activism, and how activism is best achieved, as well as the ways in which sports can parallel activism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to think critically about activist and their messages. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about activists and activism in a variety of sports and the ways of trying to effect change. Also learned so much about the steps to successful activism as well as the challenges. ",
            "\u00a0You leave a more informed person, and it teaches you to take a stance and fight for matters that are important to you. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding in the role athletes can truly affect public policy, social justice, and be advocates for the underrepresented in government. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of the most impactful classes I've taken at Yale. We learned about a variety of famous athletes and celebrated them not for their athletic achievements, but rather, for their accomplishments in changing the world for the better. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about activism and athletes. And different structures of organizing. "

            "\u00a0The course was truly fascinating. The papers were always interesting and allowed for students to explore their own specific interests. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are extremely interesting and the readings are enjoyable. One weakness is some topics seemed to be repetitive and there were not concrete concepts we were learning about. I also would have enjoyed more engagement and opinions from everyone in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Both the strength and weakness of this course is that is best taught as a lecture. Professor Glanville is a great lecturer and has a lot of interesting insights and I think the class would be better structured this way if we were lucky enough to get him to come back. ",
            "\u00a0Only strengths: powerpoints, discussion, readings, guest lectures, and even assignment. Super well-structured! ",
            "\u00a0Nothing really to say here, I loved all of it. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was great! Professor Glanville was extremely available and always came with interesting, relevant, and challenging course materials. The readings also challenged me to look past the status quo and form my own opinions of policy enactments. ",
            "\u00a0The only suggestion I have for the course was with the room. I think a bigger classroom where everyone can sit in the main area would be beneficial going forward. I genuinely enjoyed completing all of the assignments, and I thought the readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is great - PDFs for the books could be scanned and added to canvas for ease of accessibility since most of the books used are niche and not stocked by many libraries. The professor was a strength - explaining different things, pulling all the athletes, their activism work and theories on power together. the guest lectures and speaks were really good too and just added more layers to the class discussion.\r\nFor a seminar though, the class did not have that much student participation. could be improved by asking students to speak more in class, engage with each other's points and not the question-answer format of speaking that was used. It would be helpful to give students to dissect why we consider people activists, why their activism is important, and what power structures they deal with more in the discussions. Overall, just add student indepth discussion where students engage with each other and not speak to the teacher. ",
            "\u00a0This course was hands down the best class I have taken during my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0This class does a great job of supporting theory with real examples. Prof. Glanville does a great job of taking both high profile and low profile cases of interest and examining those situations under an academic lens. "

            "\u00a0I would 150% recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0YES 100%!!! This is a fantastic course taught by an incredible professor/former MLB player/human. The work is reasonable and spread out, classes are super chill, and the material is fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0100%. It is pretty low workload but super interesting. Plus Doug is great (cannot stress enough how cool he is) and a pretty laidback grader if you put effort in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I am fortunate to have taken it! I would recommend to everyone! ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. Prof G is awesome! From his incredibly interesting stories to his perfectly prepared presentations, this class is a must take for any athlete (or non-athlete for that matter) at Yale! Hands down the most rewarding class I've ever had the privilege of taking. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take the class. Glanville is an excellent teacher. He explains concepts well, has dad jokes, cares about how the students are fairing, and will bring cool guests to class/ take you to cool places. It's really chill and you will learn so much about athletes and styles of activism. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Glanville is a phenomenal teaching and is very knowledgeable about the information ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. The themes of the course are brilliantly woven together in a manner which makes the scope of learning that this course facilitates much greater than what the title of the class alone would suggest. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you can! Between engaging readings, class guests and Prof. Glanville's own personal experiences, this class truly is unlike any other at Yale. The course creates an ideal space to think critically about issues that most students at Yale are unable or unwilling to have open, honest conversations about. This course does an excellent job of taking apart the black-and-white narrative--and accompanying moral judgements--associated with issues extending beyond whether athletes should kneel or not. The individual papers and final project were a great way to academically explore controversial topics. Lastly, Prof. Glanville is such a great instructor, he is great at giving feedback every step of the way and at making himself available for conversations and help. This is much more than a course for Prof. Glanville, he truly cares both about sparking an genuine interest in students and in turning conversation into action. Truly a great course. "
