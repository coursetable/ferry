            "\u00a0This class has given me an introduction to modern South Asian literature. I have also improved my essay writing skills and have learnt how to approach seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about South Asian history, especially the Partition of India and its effects on the people. I read many authors such as Tagore, Ghosh, Manto, and Butalia. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to develop skills in comprehending and analyzing a diverse array of textual and archival materials. Throughout the span of the course, I noticed an improvement in my ability to discuss a variety of South Asian texts in both oral and written form. ",
            "\u00a0Greater writing, analysis abilities as well as in depth experiences with south Asian culture and literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about close analysis of literature, and you learn a lot about the history of different countries in South Asia ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the South Asian region which isn't an area really focused on in high school history courses. I read a lot of fantastic literature and learned about areas that can sometimes be overlooked when talking about South Asia like Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. ",
            "\u00a0South Asian history, pre+post colonialism. How to read historical texts, how to read historical fiction. Although it's focus was mainly on South Asia, Mukhopadhyay is brilliant in the way that she can connect these events to global perspectives on colonialism, and help you realize the bigger picture. "

            "\u00a0The organization of the course was excellent, allowing us to learn about different types of literature and from different time periods. I also really appreciated the freedom of the final paper, which allowed me to write about a topic I was truly interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting readings and very good and interactive discussion that is mostly student-led but professor does a great job facilitating\r\nWeaknesses: Reading were a bit rushed towards the end of the course/ instructions on essays could have been clearer ",
            "\u00a0Great literature we read! The books were really interesting and the professor is also absolutely great! ",
            "\u00a0The professor is able to balance teaching us the history of the region as well as facilitating discussions based on the works we read. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more on Bangladesh + Sri Lanka. A Golden Age was good, but not on the same level of impact that the other readings had. I wish there was more on Gender+sexuality especially queer women in SA. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you're South Asian and want to learn more about your own history, this is the course to take. Also, if you enjoy literature and would like to step away from the Western realm, we read some pretty amazing pieces in this class! If you're just interested in South Asian culture or would like to expand your knowledge in general, this will give you great insight into the actual complexities that South Asia was built around. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is an important and much-needed literature course that expanded beyond and oftentimes challenged other English courses that focus on the Western canon. I strongly recommend to all first-years able to take this seminar! ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you're not South Asain, it is a fantastic way to learn about a culture seldom covered in most American Highschools. The books we read this semester were breathtaking and thought-provoking. "
