            "\u00a0Strength - learn tangible ways to evaluate programs, obtain skills in evaluation that can be used in a concrete way outside of the classroom, small class size ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course - everything that we learned had a direct correlation with our evaluation plans. I appreciate the \"real-world\" point of view taken in this course. Our discussions of evaluations were not in a vacuum and we worked with organizations in New Haven that simulated what it would be like to do this work outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great!! I think one thing that could help is to change the pacing a little bit. It felt a bit rushed at the beginning (especially in terms of finds orgs/projects to work on), and then it felt like we had a lot of extra time toward the end of the course, so perhaps the timing/spacing of the assignments could be shifted a bit. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to program evaluation. I have learned many, tangible skills in this class in a field that is small but growing in popularity. I think these skills will serve me well in my future career.\r\nStrengths:\r\n-I absolutely love that we had the opportunity to work with a community partner and design an evaluation plan. This meant that we would learn about a topic or a certain skill in class, and then we would actually use that skill in developing our evaluation plan.\r\n-The topics covered in this course were interesting, and we had lots of opportunities to engage with the material both inside and outside of class.\r\n-It is extremely gratifying to develop a work product as part of the class and submit it to a community partner (in addition to the course itself). This is such a unique experience because you know that this plan will be used to help somebody--it's not just for a grade.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I don't think I gained that much from the various evaluation critique activities, so I would recommend cutting one or two of those out (e.g. get rid of the evaluation critique assignment, or do fewer evaluation critiques during class time). ",
            "\u00a0great course. you learn a lot of useful stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: providing hands on experience in program evaluation; matching students with projects of their interests. \r\nWeaknesses: structure of assignments- the evaluation of article being towards the end where the large portion of the projects is due. I think if that is towards the beginning might be useful since you can learn from it prior to writing your own project. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Duffany is a great professor. She's caring, supportive, and thoughtful about feedback for students. I appreciated that she learned our names and took the time to meet us outside of class. She even brought us food on the last class - so kind! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Duffany is a great professor who takes the time to listen to each student and provides students with tools that are helpful to them for future use. She makes herself available outside of the class for students who need help with their class work. ",
            "\u00a0Kathleen is a wonderful instructor who is clearly passionate about program evaluation. She genuinely cares about her students, is sensitive to the needs of her students, and was very flexible during a very busy semester. I really appreciated that she asked us for feedback on the class during the middle of the semester and was able to use that feedback and adapt a few things for the rest of the semester--this is a simple thing that makes the students feel valued and heard and it did not go unnoticed. I have also had the opportunity to meet with Kathleen individually, and I really valued her advice, her feedback and genuine interest in how the class was going and how she could make it better. ",
            "\u00a0She is very nice and accommodating. ",

I learned so many valuable evaluation skills that are applicable to so many things inside and outside of the evaluation world. I would highly recommend this class for the opportunities you get to learn tangible skills, work in a practice-based environment with a community organization, and for the change to learn from Kathleen.
