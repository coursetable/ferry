            "\u00a0I was exposed to a wide variety of fascinating topics in number theory, I got a pretty decent idea of what the whole field looks like, and what the different areas and specialties consist of. ",
            "\u00a0Variety of introductory number theory topics: congruences, quadratic reciprocity, encryption algorithms, zero knowledge proofs, variety of topics in analytic number theory, 2 and 4 squares theorem... ",
            "\u00a0An overview of basic concepts in Number Theory; Quadratic Reciprocity, number sieves, factoring, and the like. See Ireland and Rosen for a good overview of the first half of the course. The second half of the course was a lot more free form, involving student presentations and whatever topics the professor wanted to cover. ",

            "\u00a0Organization.  There was almost none to this course. The weekly quizzes stopped after the second week, there were only three homework assignments, even though 5 or 6 were planned, and only one of these was ever returned. That being said, overall it was pretty interesting. Find someone who cares about number theory to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fun course and I enjoyed how diverse the selection of topics was ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class itself was pretty chill. Having a class with so few students is really nice and made the class seem reasonably conversational. Technically it's a lecture-based course, but it's much more like a discussion section than a regular lecture. The research project at the end was pretty cool, I really liked the presentation. Ross gave great feedback on my presentation, and we worked out some problems related to it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, although the feedback was good, it came rather after the fact. That's a theme for the entire course. As of writing this review, I only know my grade on one pset (out of 4 of the 5 which were supposed to be assigned). I really had no idea if I was learning anything correctly, and that kinda made it hard to understand things. The course also wasn't very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Good material and well taught.  It would have been helpful to have gotten more of our homeworks back. "

        [
            "\u00a0If it gets taught by someone else, sure. As it stands now the lectures were somewhat dull and the grading was all over the place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is an interesting course and number theory especially with the curriculum covered in this course is related to a number of fields of math from algebra to complex analysis so there is something in it for everyone. At the end you also get to do a final presentation which allows you to learn more about a topic you find particularly interesting ",
            "\u00a0Depends. I rather liked it. If you like the professor, are interested in the material, and don't mind having literally no idea how you're doing in the course, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone who has an interest in the subject "
