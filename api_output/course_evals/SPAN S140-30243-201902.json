            "\u00a0I learned and practiced new Spanish verb tenses and grammatical structures that I had not used previously. I also improved my Spanish oral and writing skills with supplementary readings (a short novel) and videos. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course is really well done, especially when taken abroad. The material is very applicable to everyday life and I found myself being able to take away what I learned in the classroom and apply it in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the course is way too slow, we were doing some of the most fundamental grammatical points that we should've had known before arriving in Spain. I wished that they finished all the grammar beforehand so that we could've watched films or read novels to improve our vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0My only criticism is that it seemed like a disproportionate amount of the workload was piled onto the last week or so of the course. The independent oral presentation, however, was definitely my favorite part of the course. It gave me the chance to learn about a topic that I was genuinely interested in! "

            "\u00a0Yes - Spanish 140 in Bilbao was a delight. The material is interesting and being able to use what you learn in the classroom outside is a really rewarding experience, and only encouraged me to want to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I wouldn't. The work is tedious and I felt it unnecessary to do all the repetitive exercises in order to memorize the grammatical points. However, the commitment to the class was crucial because the course is worth 1.5 credits and counts towards your GPA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Despite the fast-paced nature of the course and the sheer amount of new content, if you put in the hard work you end up learning a lot in the end! "
