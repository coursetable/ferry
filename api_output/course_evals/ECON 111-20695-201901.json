            "\u00a0This course gave me a basic understanding of Macroeconomics and helped me use macroeconomic theory to analyze the world's current economies and policy decisions. ",

            "\u00a0I learned lots of macroeconomic terms and concepts, and felt that this course was amazing for the material learnt. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of good stuff ",
            "\u00a0Intro Macroeconomics; essentially why countries grow, how inflation/interest rates work, global markets, and trade. Some other things too, but those come to mind most immediately. ",
            "\u00a0It is an excellent into class to get to know Economics major better, especially for those who never took Economics before. The class covers different Macroeconomics government objectives, but what I honestly enjoyed the most about are the policy recommendations. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned how to think about large-scale economics in an improved fashion, and learned lots of new terminology and concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good appreciation of macroeconomic issues as well as some economic intuition on a range of macroeconomic issues. I learnt the basics of some macroeconomic models and learnt how to analyze the effect of shocks or long-term developments on economic variables. I also learnt that macroeconomic policymaking is wrought with challenges and gleaned some insights as to how this is dealt with in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic macroeconomic theory; most importantly, how to analyze a country's wellbeing in the short and long run. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about the global economy as well as the domestic economy, which I found to be very useful. There were so many real world examples and a great follow up to Intro to Micro, which lacked a lot of a real world data. The concepts I learned were useful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Basic macroeconomic principles; definitely more advanced and faster-paced than AP. More in-depth analysis of financial markets, trade, and foreign exchange. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Seminar format allows you to ask more questions and really get into the material\r\n- No section makes it more approachable\r\n- Project based so you are forced to apply the material ",
            "\u00a0I really like how I learned the material in the seminar style: making me more engaged with my learning. There were a lot of components to the course, but they all complemented each other to create a cohesive course where I feel like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hawkins could give fewer assignments and more guidance ",
            "\u00a0Virtually all strengths; the class had a good level of participation, weekly assignments make sure you understand the material as you go; the mix of one project and one midterm was good. ",
            "\u00a0After taking other economics intro classes, I was really expecting this one to be as boring. But surprisingly, it was not. I really enjoyed every class  although some data charts and tables get overwhelming sometimes. The course has many strengths but most importantly the encouraging environment to learn. I took economics lecture classes before, but I barely knew who my professor is, who is with me in class, or what is going on in the slides. If you are someone who want to learn and ACTUALLY understand what is going on, take this course (but bear in mind that it has a bit more workload than the lecture but for me it was so worth it. so in the end it depends on your priorities; if you want easy grades with zero understanding go to the lecture, if you care a bit about learning and you enjoy econ and willing to put some effort, go for this course). Also, this is one of the most well-organized classes I have ever taken. Professor Hawkins tell you everything you need to know and do. He also gives you many many many opportunities to understand and learn more, but you just need to actually put effort and use opportunities. You have tutors (who were so helpful from my experience!), office hours, PIAZZA IS SO HELPFUL TOO even for last minute questions.\r\nA weaknesses of the course is that sometimes I felt there is way too much data and graphs and I did not know where do all of these fit in the main point of that specific class. You also have to memorize some data which was a bit annoying. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hawkins was certainly a strength - he made it as fun as possible and was good at teaching. The course could be boring at times, but that may just have been me and I'm not sure if it could be changed. Overall I liked it much better than the first Econ class I took. ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized excellently and set at a good pace for an intro course. I really appreciated Professor Hawkin's efforts in having the pre-class prep as well as post-class quizzes which helped to contextualize class material as well as allowed us to review it in a timely manner so that it sticks to our memory better. Feedback is given appropriately. ",
            "\u00a0The course was planned very well. The pre and post class quizzes really helped understanding new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0He was a good teacher, but I wish that everything wasn't so nit-picky ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Real world examples, Group projects, opportunities to lift my grade through class prep and class practices, Gradescope (which allowed me to easily view my mistakes and talk to Professor Hawkins about them), peer tutors, Professor Hawkins' teaching style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final exam covered way too much. It should not have been cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is very well-taught-- although you may struggle with some units, there is a plethora of resources (office hours, very thorough slides) that are extremely helpful. The professor is awesome, and is always willing to give more explanations if you're not clear.\r\nWeaknesses: More time was spent on some topics earlier in the semester (e.g. Solow model) than on others (e.g. IS/MP) later in the semester, which made the latter half feel a bit more rushed.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I think that a basic understanding of economics is essential, and this class provides a good foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an amazing course. It is structured in a way that really forces you to understand the economics behind everything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel like given the material, it is best to learn these intro materials in the seminar style. Plus, William Hawkins is a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Eh if you have to take it. If not dont ",
            "\u00a0Yes; even as I took it to fulfill an obligation, it ended up being one of my favorite classes. The material is interesting and the professor (Dr. Hawkins) is really excellent. It's not too difficult, and you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes hawkins is great! ",
            "\u00a0I never expected myself to write this for an intro class, especially after taking into micro, but this is honestly a great course. Surprisingly, this course was interesting. Professor Hawkins is also a very funny and understanding professor. He is always willing to help, and I feel that alone makes the course better!! Not too mathy, and not too easy. take it if you want to get to know economics more but you are scared of going for tough classes with nerdy people! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think it was a great class for someone, like myself, who knows they never want to do much Econ but just want to understand the fundamentals. It's fun, interesting and important to learn about national economies, GDP, banks, growth, etc., and Professor Hawkins does a great job teaching in the seminar style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It gives you a great background regarding macroeconomics. It's set appropriately for an intro class, so even if you have no background, it'll be a good pace. If you have background, the class adds some real life contextualization and intuition which are really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. You will learn and interact with the concepts on a much deeper level, and you will receive feedback for everything you do. ",
            "\u00a0yes- essential to understand macro on a basic level ",
            "\u00a0Better than the lecture if you prefer a classroom setting, though grading did seem nit-picky. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much in this class and Professor Hawkins is a great professor who will try his best to help you succeed, whether that is through holding several office hours a week or holding review sessions before big exams. It is a great follow up to Intro to Micro, which lacked real world examples. This macro class had ample real world examples, which make the lessons feel more useful, and was much more applicable to real life. It is an important class for anyone interested in studying global affairs, and it is also useful for anyone interested in our domestic economy. I learned so much about banks and trade that I think is useful information for anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this over the lecture. You will get more personal feedback and work more closely with your peers. "
