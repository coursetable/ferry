For the field trip, I would have liked to spend more time learning about what kind of research goes on at STRI and if possible talk to those researchers about their methods. I think I would have learned more than by only designing our own study. Another weakness is that people have different levels of experience with designing, carrying out, and writing about research. Some people were ahead, and some were behind (but I'm not sure how that could be improved). Finally, it would have been great to get feedback on our scientific writing so that we could improve it for next time. ",

I guess this could be done if the trip was over the spring, but I'm not sure how it would be done with a winter trip. It might be helpful to have a bit more guidance in choosing a project topic. Maybe Liza and Simon could roughly outline some general ideas for students to expand upon. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely the trip to Panama. The only way to properly learn about tropical field ecology is to be in the tropics! A potential weakness of the course was having to write group lab reports. I know that Liza and Simon decided to have us write group lab reports to understand about the difficulties of collaboration when writing papers, but it was a bit hard because some people in the groups had never written a lab report before. That meant that the people that had written lab reports before shouldered most of the work. ",

You don't have to be a tropical forester/ botanist/ ecologist to take this class as long as you are interested in the material and excited about seeing the process of conducting tropical ecology research.
