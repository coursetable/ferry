            "\u00a0I deepened my knowledge of Greek and I learned a great deal about Thucydides and his opus The Peloponnesian Wr. ",
            "\u00a0This course is aimed at strengthening one's command of Ancient Greek by taking on one of the most difficult text (if not *the* most difficult text) of Ancient Greek Literature. Not only my command of Greek improved a lot, but under Prof. Greenwood guidance I was prompted to pay better attention to issues of translation.  Having taken this class, I feel that my knowledge of a pivotal text from Greek antiquity has improved by far. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the complex ways Thucydides tells this story of the Peloponnesian War, and I think I gained insight into how Thucydides might use narrative and language to say more than is immediately apparent. I also think my Greek became stronger. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was Professor Greenwood.   The weakness of the course is he breadth of the material which cannot really be covered in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was very strong in how it wove together reading and translation as well as many opportunities for class discussion, interpretive questions, and outside scholarship. Despite Thucydides being an especially difficult author, I always felt supported and encouraged in the reading and welcome to pose questions and propose analyses of what Thucydides is doing in this narrative. I cannot think of any weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in ancient historiography or who is looking for an engaging class to improve his/her knowledge of the Ancient Greek language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an excellent course on an important author with a wonderful professor. I was encouraged to take this course in part because Prof. Greenwood was teaching it and I am very glad I took that advice. "
