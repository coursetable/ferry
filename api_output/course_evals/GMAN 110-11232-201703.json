I found the listening part to be the most difficult part of the tests consistently and didn't feel like we would practice this enough. ",

            "\u00a0The class runs on class participation so the atmosphere is greatly, but not entirely dependent on your classmates (the other part being your teacher). The assignments were quite fun, there were many German events scheduled (every week), and Dr Wolf-Farr was always ready to answer questions after class etc. It got slightly exhausting nearing the end, especially since classes were every day and assignments got heavier. I would suggest removing or tapering off the email assignments near the end because I did not find it very useful for learning the language. "
