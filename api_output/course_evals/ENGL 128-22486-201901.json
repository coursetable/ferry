            "\u00a0I learned to read more critically and engage with texts from a variety of cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new ways to think about literature, about postcolonial literature, and creative ways to think about the relationship between form and content. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best English courses I've taken at Yale (which, as a rule, have tended to be incredibly fun, interesting, and formative). I hadn't ever taken a class in what we call \"World Anglophone Literatures,\" and this class gave me the tools with which to read these works with a greater understanding of their cultural contexts. Professor Mukhopadhyay does an AMAZING job of not just introducing these themes and conflicts but carrying them organically throughout the course, which I thought was one of the greatest strengths of this class. If you're interested in the power dynamics of language (particularly English, of course), gender, time, the family, and so much more in the post-colonial world  take this class. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of literature that often dealt with colonialism, the course provided so many opportunities for learning more about how colonial violence, sexism, and anxiety manifest in works of art and reflect the anxieties of a larger group of people. Repeated themes like time, inheritance, and knowledge across the novels and short stories gave each of us new understandings of \"world English literatures\" and the chance to examine different works through a variety of new lenses. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned that the English department thinks it has checked all the boxes on being diverse and inclusive by providing this one singular course when it comes to having a major that is predominantly focused on white people readings. I mean seriously, to group the rest of the world into one class! British Literature and American Literature are so obviously their own categories to the English department, and the entire world is grouped together in a way that presents some of the most stereotypical images of a region @godofsmallthings ",
            "\u00a0You will learn to think about the English language and its relationship to literature outside the context of a novel and begin to consider it within the broader scope of global politics and the global literature curriculum. You will question who we assign credibility to as authors, why we include what we do in a syllabus for \"World English Literatures,\" and what it means to write in English as a person or as a character occupying a non-English speaking part of the globe. This class teaches you to think about literature in ways that no other introductory class will push you to do. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think of texts in content and I also learned to write more detailed essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze writing from a standpoint beyond the bounds of western epistemology. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The reading list is wonderful, and the pace is fast but not overwhelming (expect to read approx 1 book per week). Assignments are not too frequent (2 mini assignments, 1 midterm paper, 1 final paper) but they do help you develop a critical writing and reading ability and they are nicely spread out through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is fantastic. I loved the archival research requirement for the midterm paper. I wish there had been more guidance and feedback for the final paper, which sort of felt like just another assignment rather than a culminating project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Mukhopadhyay! She is so knowledgeable (particularly about South Asian literature; I really enjoyed this focus, particularly because I knew so little about anglophone South Asian lit going in), so passionate, and so easy to connect with over the literature. She did a great job arranging the reading list (which is also a major strength  so many books to love!) and pacing the class in general. There is a not-insignificant (though not super daunting) amount of writing: two short close-readings, a midterm paper, and a final paper, but they were spaced so well throughout the course that I always felt really ready to dig into them, rather than stressed. And the assignments themselves are so engaging: the close readings are so fun, and getting to dig around in the archives for the midterm and final paper was an amazing experience for me; I hadn't done that in a literature class before. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class, which is perhaps not incredibly relevant to future students but something I really want to mention  was the group itself. I don't think I have ever been in a seminar at Yale with so many genuinely interested people, none of whom felt a desire to speak over others, or to raise their hands just to hear themselves speak. (For what it's worth, the class happened to be almost entirely comprised of women). Sometimes in seminars here it feels like everyone is repeating each other's points, or just agreeing with each other, or debating each other for the sake of being contradictory. I felt that I learned so much from my fellow students in this class that we were actually building our ideas off of each other. Every class, someone said something that made me immediately reach for my pen because it was such an insightful comment that it really altered and expanded my understanding of the text. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any. There were a couple of books I didn't LOVE, but such is the case in any literature class! I don't really think that's a weakness, but I honestly can't think of anything else. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mukhopadhyay was incredibly engaging and intelligent. She created an environment where each student's response was valued, and yet challenged us to push ourselves to make connections we wouldn't have otherwise made. The course also covered a good range of literature, although it would've been nice to see more from Latin America and to read works that are perhaps less well-known, but instructive just the same, rather than just the go-to novel for each continent (i.e. \"The God of Small Things\" as a stereotypical look at South Asia). While we're at it, why not take these same themes and regions and expand them into their own classes? ",
            "\u00a0See above answer for more commentary on weaknesses. Strengths? I guess it is the one course requirement of the English major that for sure requires you to read novels by people of color. That is pretty lit, but it also is cracked that there are no other courses required by the English major that ensure that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The structure of the class was quite enjoyable! I like reading a new book each week and discussing it in class. Priyasha lead wonderful discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: As much as I liked the class structure, it did get to be pretty repetitive. It would have been fun to have student-led discussions from time to time... maybe each student has a day where they present and then guide the first half of class? I think that would be one more fun way to add variation to our class days. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is wide-ranging, diverse, and you really walk out feeling like your scope of literature has been widened. An amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class was the discussions and the short essays-- it forced us to really get to the argument. A weakness was no workshopping or discussion of our writing in class, but this was made up by the freedom we had to talk about our essays with the professor ",
            "\u00a0The books were brilliant and oftentimes subverted knowledge produced in the western canon - however, it would have been great if we spent more time on each book and read fewer books. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this. I think it's important to read works outside of the traditional European canon, but also to think about how the canon is constructed and how lists of \"must-read world Anglophone literature\" are created. Who and what gets a place on the list? It's always great to expand your reading list and this course will help do that! ",
            "\u00a0I would, for the foundational English requirement. It exposes students to literature many of them have not read before. But if you don't need it to satisfy the English major requirement I would recommend taking a more advanced seminar in postcolonial literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  a million times yes. Take it for Professor Mukhopadhyay, take it for the reading list, take it for the English major, take it for fun! I looked forward to coming to class, and of course to reading the books. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this course. The readings are challenging at times, but incredibly rewarding. Professor Mukhopadhyay did such a wonderful job of tying things together during our discussions and illuminating points, from overarching patterns to small, yet still significant, details. As someone whose heritages are rarely represented in English classes, I really enjoyed getting to dip my toe into a sea of literature I've never been exposed to in the classroom, and I hope to continue exploring these works. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking an English seminar at Yale, especially majors who are looking to fulfill their foundational requirements. The syllabus was excellent and the material was extremely engaging and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend them to take it with Professor Mukhopadhyay, but unless they had to take it for the English major, I definitely would not recommend it. Too much grouping together of the entire world into one course, why put anyone else through that if that didnt have to take it? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! A great way to open up your understanding of other cultures and backgrounds through the books we read. Super, super engaging and definitely worthy of taking. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent. Take it for the reading list and to question the problematics of lumping all non-English authors into a single curriculum. This course will make you think and contextualize in ways you never have before. ",
            "\u00a0YES! My favorite foundational English class to date ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this class is essential, especially in the context of the foundational courses, in providing a more diverse and representative curriculum. "
