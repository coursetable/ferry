            "\u00a0The course taught me about the similarities and differences (more the former than the latter!) between adult humans and babies & animals. It also taught me about the basic differences that make us separate from the creatures in the animal kingdom. Perhaps most importantly, it taught me that there is still a lot that we don't know about animals, babies, and ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about infant and animal cognitive experience and how to question some conclusions that are drawn about their capacities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about structuring experiments properly in order to control properly and focus on hypothesis testing. I also learned in depth about the reasons experiments about babies and animals can inform us about the workings of the adult human mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the psychology of babies and animals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so freaking much. This course opens your mind to a lot of stuff you didn't know you needed to know, but it's so worth it. The first psychology class I've taken in which the data from studies were not questionable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about research done with babies and animals and the current thought on the complexities of both groups. The course was very helpful with practicing reading psych research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the experimental design necessary to conduct research on young humans and animals as well as most of the groundbreaking findings about young humans and animals. I also learned how to observe similarities and differences across species while still being careful not to anthropomorphize. ",
            "\u00a0A very thorough and scientific approach to developmental psychology and the mental lives of animals ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interesting in learning about the development of babies and animals. It compared the development and how similar they are. ",
            "\u00a0This class -- as the name may suggest -- focuses on the psychology and behaviors of babies and animals. For people interested in psychology/cognitive science, it was very interesting and different from other courses, because it focuses on two specific and distinct groups of individuals, both of which lend a lot to our understanding of adult human behavior. It was extremely engaging, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a fascinating (and cute!) course. Aside from the cumulative exams, I found the three essay assignments to be particularly helpful. The final essay centered around designing your own experiment (an open-ended assignment where your test subjects were to be either babies or animals), and this was an intriguing project as it allowed us to pool our knowledge, choose a topic of the most interest to us, and design a real experiment that could potentially be implemented in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compare species when asking research questions, as well as what kinds of questions are most productive to pursue, and which areas of research are currently open to exploration. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an appreciation for the continuum of capacities possessed by animals and people at various stages of development. Coming into the class, I expected there to be far more qualitative/categorical differences between adult humans and animals/babies, and the research findings we discussed have prompted significant introspection about my scientific and ethical views. I also developed a methodological understanding of how to conduct research when your subjects can't speak. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the minds of babies and animals work! It was very enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about not only babies and animals but also the relation between psychology and nature and the reasons we respond to things in certain ways. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course I strengthened my critical thinking skills and my ability to comprehend complex material. This course gave me a thorough introduction to understanding the cognitive ability of infants and animals. The constant comparison and contrast between infants and animals allowed me to understand concepts better and gave me that ability to comprehend the reasoning behind different theories. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a starting framework for talking/thinking about animal cognition and infant development. This course is heavy on insights and knowledge, more so than specific skills. The insights/knowledge have to do with questions like \"are humans altruistic by nature?\" (yes! arguably!) and \"can dolphins recognize themselves?\" (yes!) and many more. The course provides much food for thought about what makes us human. Complexity of communication, specialization of knowledge, etc. are all explored as candidates for uniquely human behavior, but the course never loses sight of the fact that humans are animals after all. Very good course! "

            "\u00a0Professor Wynn was very engaging, but I feel that the grading itself was a bit lacking, especially when it came to the papers. It seemed like I put in double the amount of effort into the later papers, incorporating input from the earlier papers, but consistently made the same grade. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Nothing to improve on from my view ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were extremely entertaining and covered most of the material that was later tested. Exams were very fair and properly assessed knowledge of the material.\r\n\r\nReadings maybe could have been tied in better. I ended up cramming catching up on readings before each exam and wasn't punished for that. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting material and great lectures! The one thing that I did not like were the papers. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is it was very interesting material and it was clearly presented to focus on certain key themes. A weakness  was the class was not very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was one of the best organized classes I taken and the information of the class was presented in a very engaging manner. I would not say there were any major weaknesses of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: clear and fantastic lectures by a professor who is extremely caring, approachable, and vastly knowledgeable about the subject material; such a great experience taking the class from a researcher who has herself published extremely significant papers in the field; tests were fair and were offered with ample preparation/study material beforehand ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was structured very well. I enjoyed coming to class and learning a different topic concerning animals or babies each day. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Wynn really wants each student to succeed and makes sure everyone understands both the material and the assessments. She teaches with so much enthusiasm that it is easy to pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0This course included 3 essays, and 2 cumulative exams throughout the course of the semester. I found this to be just enough assignments to keep students on their toes without over-burdening them with busy work. This was a strength of the course. I would say, however, that the lecture style of the course did not allow for much engagement/participation from the students, although the class was only about 30 students. If there could be a way to incorporate a few socratic seminars or small-group based discussion, I think this would be extremely beneficial to the course and the level of engagement on the part of the students. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was its unique focus on cognitive science through babies and animals. Because of this it allowed for a lot of interesting discussions and a wide range of findings from many disciplines without having to go over the fundamentals and full scope of each discipline. All elements of cognitive science were featured together, but because it was all tied to this specific, and more basic, scope of babies and animals, it made it possible to easily grasp it all. It was a great introduction to the major and field. Another strength is the nature of the material is on its own entertaining and interesting. Who doesn't like watching babies and puppies? Lastly, I found the assignments to be refreshing in the sense that they asked for our own opinions, predictions, and allowed for creativity rather than just research and single sided topics. One weakness of the course was that I found the non-study readings to not be as helpful to the courses material as they could have been. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course is interesting, but it was presented in a way that made it more difficult to digest everything. Each class consisted of learning about different studies and then being expected to hold them all in memory for the exams. The structure of the class should be more geared to learning about overarching concepts and learning a few studies for each, but focusing more on the themes and the \"why\" of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers lots of interesting material, and sometimes included recent findings that were just published in the news, which I enjoyed. The instructor also included lots of funny videos or pictures which livened be things up. The weaknesses in this iteration of the course was that the projector screen of the room we were in keapt malfunctioning which was annoying. I would also have enjoyed a little more coverage of animal cognition, especially in sea mammals. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting subject but few grades were offered so maybe a small quiz every now and then could be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a strength of this course is the way it was formatted. Since the reading coincided with the lectures, this gave me the ability to thoroughly understand the material presented. ",
            "\u00a0There are some readings that have a very bad useful-information-to-length ratio, but other than that, it's a pretty solid course! The assignments are interesting and there aren't too many. I would say that grading out of 10 points is harsh when there's only 3 essay assignments though. "

            "\u00a0The course is incredibly interesting, and professor Wynn is very engaging! Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Professor Wynn is great, the material is incredibly interesting and the work is not very difficult! Great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Wynn was incredibly entertaining, knowledgeable, and informative. If you like babies or animals, you get to learn a lot about them, and see cute pictures and videos too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - the course was incredibly engaging. I loved going to class, but honestly the homework (essays) were incredibly long and dense. They were only worth 2 points on the exams, which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Yuh ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a great class with a wonderful professor about a super interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! The professor is lovely, the work is interesting and engaging, and the material is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a fantastic introductory developmental psychology class that can even prepare a student with interests in conducting research. You will learn so much about the field from a field leader in Professor Wynn, which creates a one-of-a-kind environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fantastic, approachable professor; fair grading; wealth of insight into development psychology and animal psychology ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a very interesting class focusing on development. If you love babies, animals, and development this class is for you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if it seems like the material isn't relevant to your course of study, it is highly interesting and she is a wonderful teacher. ",
            "\u00a0This class -- as the name may suggest -- focuses on the psychology and behaviors of babies and animals. For people interested in psychology/cognitive science, it was very interesting and different from other courses, because it focused on two specific and distinct groups of individuals, both of which lend a lot to our understanding of adult human behavior. It was extremely engaging, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a fascinating (and cute!) course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great class to go into with little or no background in the field and leave with an understanding of many aspects of the field. The subject matter is also fun, and the level of work was manageable. ",
            "\u00a0In its current state, I think this class needs to be revised in terms of structure. Professor Wynn is a charismatic lecturer, but there is such a focus on studies and experiments that it becomes information overload. Being expected to memorize the most minute details of an experiment isn't productive for a midterm or an exam. The grading of the papers was also shaky, where they would ask for one thing, but then it would seem like they would grade the papers on an entirely different scale. I think clear grading guidelines would help the class a lot and maybe instead of assigning articles, just go ahead and assign a textbook. The focus on study after study makes studying for the exams way too much. The class in and of itself isn't difficult in terms of concepts and ideas, but it honestly felt like they were trying to make it harder than it needed to be. One of my friends took the class Credit/D and she struggled a lot and was worried about getting a D or below in the class, which says something about the course difficulty. I was excited to take the class, but it ended up being a personal letdown for me and some of my friends. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, it was my favorite of the whole year! The material was fascinating and thought provoking, and the instructor did very well at explaining the implications of specific baby or animal findings to adult humans. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a fantastic class for anyone interested in animal or infant psychology. Even psychology/cognitive science students who focus on human adults should take this class; it would broaden their understand of what makes a capacity \"hard\" to implement. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely!! Professor Wynn is amazing and so knowledgeable in her field, she is also a very good pedagog. ",
            "\u00a0A good course to take if you're interested in the topic but also if you can maybe cr/d because you only get 5 grades total (3 essays, 2 exams), and if you don't do well on some of the big ones your grade may take a hit. Overall, very cool course to learn from though. Also, go to class because the videos and demos will help you remember the experiments as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another students because the professor was amazing and taught the course very well. ",
            "\u00a0If you stay up at night wondering what a human person even is, this course is for you. I have found a lot of info. that will stay with me about humans and their tendencies and cognitive equipment in this course. Highly recommend! "
