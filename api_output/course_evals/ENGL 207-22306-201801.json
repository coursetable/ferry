            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the conventions of medieval literature; something I knew absolutely nothing about prior to the start of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bloch is truly the top of his field. Taking a class with him and learning from him is a real privilege. I am humbled to be his student. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the world of medieval romance and medieval literature more generally. I learned about the eclipse of the epic form by the romance and its own supplanting by the novel. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and how to think about medieval romance.  In particular, I learned about the themes entangled in the genre:  the development of a system of law and of centralized government, increasing awareness of interior depth, remnants of classical and religious thought, etc.  Talking about and thinking about these themes was what, for me, made the course an especially (and unexpectedly) enriching experience.

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. The readings were very interesting even if some of them were a bit of a slog (Quest of the Holy Grail has a lot of Christian moralizing, I'll say). A highlight was definitely going to Beinecke to see an actual 13th century illuminated manuscript of one of the texts we were reading in class. This was overall a pretty chill but fun class (although there is a lot of reading). ",
            "\u00a0It was a very fun course and I would not change anything about it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bloch selected and excellent array of texts for this course. He led discussion well.  These discussions were the main component of the course, and Professor Bloch was excellent at showing us interesting aspects of the works and leading us through them. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is Professor Bloch. His lively manner of teaching prevented the class from being dry or staid. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness might be some of the texts that we read. While the fabliaux and others overturned the stereotypes of medieval literature, other texts, such as The Quest of the Holy Grail seemed only to confirm some of the stereotypes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  I really enjoyed the readings.  I appreciated that they were fairly spread out (I thought we could have been assigned a bit of a heavier reading load, even).  Professor Bloch was absolutely brilliant -- the way that he talked about and contextualized the works changed the course from one I was taking to fulfill a requirement to one that was fun, intellectually exciting, and enlightening in and of itself.\r\nWeaknesses:  I wanted Professor Bloch to push our discussions a little harder.  I felt that the class was sometimes rather lethargic in responding to the material when it was in fact brimming with ideas and questions worth parsing.  I felt personally very excited by what we were learning but not as though that excitement had an outlet, which was a little disappointing.  While I still got an incredible amount out of taking the course, I think it could have been even better if we had been pushed in the discussions.  One way that discussions were facilitated extremely effectively in another class I took in the fall was through required discussion questions -- we would have to answer some questions or submit some questions on Canvas each week in response to the readings.  The resultant discussions were almost always some of the most thought-provoking and fruitful ones I've had in any class at Yale. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It's obviously pretty niche, but I thought it was a lot of fun and R. Howard Bloch knows about everything there is to know about the subject, so taking this class with him was very cool. Also, in general, the texts were very interesting and a lot more readable than I was expecting given they were written in the 12th and 13th centuries (shoutout to modern English prose translations). I know my King Arthur mythos much better than I did before! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take a class with Professor Bloch. He sees things that others don't and the breadth and depth of his knowledge are incredible. There is no better way to learn to live life and see the universe than by taking a course with Prof. Bloch. ",
            "\u00a0A great course with a very rich syllabus. It's a privilege to study this material with Professor Bloch, who's a true authority in the field. One of the most interesting literature classes I've taken during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  The texts were well selected and interesting, and Professor Bloch is a fascinating professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommennd this class to students looking to fulfill the medieval requirement for the English major who also want to get something out of the requirement. Professor Bloch's class is not difficult, but neither is it a GUT. Professor Bloch himself is a joy to learn from, and his syllabus does a good job of presenting the major romances of the medieval period. The class most likely will not astound anyone, but also will not likely make anyone regret taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student!  Medieval romance as a genre is deceptively rich.  I took this class to fulfill a medieval requirement and fell completely in love with the material.  The stories were sometimes bizarre, sometimes heartbreaking, often unexpected, always entertaining.  And Professor Bloch is just incredible.  His scholarship and breadth of knowledge is amazing, and his readings of the texts opened them up to analysis and thought in a completely new way for me.  I don't think this class will be offered next year, but if it is ever offered again in the future, take it!  You'll get to read some of the earliest texts about King Arthur and Tristan and Yseut/Isolde (think Wagner), as well as some of the earliest known texts written by a (French) woman and a text that deals explicitly with gender fluidity, while listening to the preeminent scholar of the topic talk about the way these works evince the development of basically every element of society as we know it today.  It's incredible. "
