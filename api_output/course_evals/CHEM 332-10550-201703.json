            "\u00a0This class definitely gave me a greater understanding of thermodynamics, which is essentially the main focus of the course. A lot of the information here is fundamental to other disciplines, like chemistry and biology, and I felt that it was thus very helpful for my studies in biochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course Credit D because I wanted a general knowledge of physical chemistry (I study PV energy storage).

More specifically gases, thermo, electro, kinetics, and mixtures which were the hardest for me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned two things: (1) there are lots of kinds of ice that can undergo weird phase transitions at high pressure, and (2) thermodynamics - as taught in this class - is the most hopelessly boring and inapplicable field out of all of the potential academic fields that I have ever encountered. I did write down a whole lot of equations, but because their meaning and usage was never explained, I wouldn't really classify that as something that I learned. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very fair, and the material is always very well explained in class and in section. We followed the textbook closely, which tends to be helpful in chemistry classes, although I often liked the moments when we discussed methods or apparatuses outside of the textbook. The course moves at a fast pace, which may not be ideal for people with especially busy course schedules. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were good and engaging. The tests were sometimes time crunches. The problem sets were pretty challenging and it always felt like the lecture material didn't lead to being able to solve those problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear lectures and useful problem sets help students to learn the material well. Discussion sections are very useful and help students master the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is poorly written and vague in many areas. ",
            "\u00a0This is a solid course. It is hard material, especially if you're not coming from a chemistry background, but Professor Schmuttenmaer organizes the material and presents it clearly and with flair. I appreciate that he utilizes opportunities to do demonstrations in the class - those are always the things you'll remember long after you graduate. It's tough  material and has forced me to work harder than ever to keep up but I can't me mad because I think that's just the nature of the material. I'm glad I took it with a professor who cares about the students and making the class high quality. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very closely modeled after Atkins' Physical Chemistry, and just like Atkins it offered a rigorous examination of the principles that underlay physical chemistry. \r\n\r\nIn the same sense, since the lectures followed the delivery of the textbook very closely, reading and understanding the material in the textbook was more than sufficient without attending lectures.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the Fermi-like problems at the end of every problem set, and thought that they were good for building up skills essential for a researcher. \r\n\r\nI found a disconnect between the material taught in the lecture, the problems in the problem sets, the discussion sections and the material tested in the exams. The first two were primarily from Atkins, and were much more rigorous. The discussion sessions mainly served to clarify questions about the lecture and provide introductory problems, while the exams were sometimes less challenging than expected, given the nature of the problems from Atkins one was used to.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve problem solving skills I would definitely recommend going through the end-of-chapter problems in Atkins, even though they are in general more difficult what one can expect in the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course lecture closely followed the book, although the professor was constantly commenting that we were behind (which was somewhat reflected by the greater content covered by the practice tests). I am not sure why there was a pacing issue this year, as the students were not disruptive. A lot of concepts I did have to read the book more to understand. I did not like how the tests would cover topics that were covered for five minutes on one day and never revisited, but it may have been done that way to establish a curve in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include the entire teaching staff - Prof Schmuttenmaer is a fantastic and humorous lecturer and the TAs are very helpful and humble at the same time. In addition, the textbook is very comprehensive and lectures are always useful. A weakness that I found difficult was the long walk to SCL where this class was held. ",
            "\u00a0CHEM 332 did not teach me anything, not because I am a master of thermodynamics (I'm not) but because it was simply not organized in a way that anything could be learned; if you had given me the equation sheets that I got to use for the final exam, I would have been just about as well-equipped to take the exam before I started the class as after I finished it. In order to improve this class, I would spend time in class not only writing equations on the board, but explaining what kinds of situations they apply to, and doing some examples of how they might be used; I would either come up with new problem sets that contained problems that were in any way similar to exam problems, or rewrite the exams such that they used the equations that we learned in class rather than testing us on random facts mentioned once or topics covered in high school chemistry that we never even went over in this course. I would also try to build up the material in a way such that it felt that we were learning a body of knowledge that built on itself rather than a collection of random and unrelated equations; I felt that the TAs in the review session had a strong sense of how thermodynamics could be taught in a logical and cohesive way, and had they been given control of the lectures, I am certain that it would have been a far better class.  This might all be easier if pchem were taught in the way that most schools do it - quantum first and then thermo as an application of quantum - but I suppose that is probably a lost cause. ",
            "\u00a0Could have been improved by motivating bigger picture reasons to care about the subject matter rather than focusing on the textbook details. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course content is good, and the textbook was extremely helpful in understanding the course material.\r\n\r\nI think Prof. Schmuttenmaer could organize his lectures better. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was taught very well, and the assignments and exams were fair. \r\n\r\nDiscussion sections were sometimes a little confusing. It would also be great to have more demonstrations in class. ",
            "\u00a0make problem sets worth more and put less questions on exams. also let TAs look at exams so they can review it before giving it out. sometimes it trips you up to have a question without all the information or a question that doesn't make sense. that confusion causes time to be lost and therefore wastes precious time during exams. also, the exam questions should be related the concepts we learned or shouldn't be related about history. less writing questions and more math questions please. but a big strength is that test grades are given back on the day of the exam. ",
            "\u00a0The class doesn't build much on the textbook - the classes mostly just reviewed some of the content in a more shallow way. ",
            "\u00a0Exams were in general easy, which isn't categorically a bad thing but doesn't necessarily assess mastery of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Good lecture, good material, well laid out. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it wasn't very hard, and the textbook was very good. The TA's were also generally very helpful. However, the class overall has several ways in which it could be improved. First of all, lectures, homework, and exams felt like 3 totally different classes- lectures seemed like and endless cycle of \"lets assume everything is an ideal gas- oh look now we can derive an equation from PV=nRT\" and then deriving things from that equation, etc. and occasionally adding in correction terms for real gasses, without ever really doing problems in class or showing how the equations we derived could be applied. The homework generally made sense given what was in the textbook, which was only partially what we covered in class, but I do feel like I learned something from doing the homework, it just wasn't what was on the exams. The exams were the worst culprit in not aligning with the course- Professor Schmuttenmayer claimed that \"the exams were designed to be long for the amount of time given because if you did the homework you should be able to do the questions quickly,\" but that logic didn't apply because the exams weren't anything like the homework and often not like anything we did in class either- instead, they were a random mix of gen chem problems, trivia, and long conceptual true false sections. Overall, this course needs to seriously consider what it is trying to teach and align its assessments to that material, as well as consider that students might be interested in applications other than gasses pushing on pistons,sterling heat engines, and making solutions. Additionally, it would have been nice if this class went beyond whats taught in general chemistry in more areas than just deriving the Gibbs energy and phase diagrams- I find kinetics and electrochemistry interesting, but I felt like I didn't learn anything new in those areas. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was easy to follow, section was helpful, and the problem sets were not too bad although they required a significant amount of time to complete. The class was almost completely about thermodynamics instead of the other aspects of physical chemistry as well. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very clear and helpful.  The textbook, problem sets, and worksheets from section were all very helpful in preparing for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Not a good professor ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course was definitely the homework. Problems were often only tangentially related to what we actually learned in class and would actually be tested on. Their content and difficulty were not at all reflective of the exams. They were also poorly planned, and we would sometimes be asked to answer questions on chapters we didn't cover, leading to high levels of frustration. Grading was very harsh and had little transparency. My homework scores were sometimes very good and sometimes extremely poor, yet those scores did not correlate at all with how well I understood the material or how well I eventually scored on the exam.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, sometimes during lecture it felt like equations were thrown on the board with little in the way of explanation. Taking a few minutes here and there to provide more real life or theoretical examples of why the equation we're working with is useful would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Im an MB&B major who was forced to take this course in a year, because the MB&B version of the class was cancelled.  Not a week went by that I wasnt upset about this.  This course was fine, and I did learn some fundamental things about pchem that are useful and applicable (like a more rigorous understanding of equilibrium and phase diagrams).  However, I imagine that the other course would have been much more in line with my needs. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this class was fairly well taught. Professor S was very organized and structured making the class fairly easy to follow. However I believe that his assessments were a bit unfair at times. They were always very long and should take longer than the 50 minutes we were given. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course follows textbook closely, TAs were good, course is well organized, discussion sections are very helpful and practice worksheets are too\r\nweaknesses: Problem sets don't count for enough, three exams is a lot and they all weigh a lot "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly one who likes thermodynamics / gen chem, since that is what this course tends to cover. I recommend this course even to a student planning on taking the biology-themed equivalent, provided they are more interested in the topics covered here. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone with an interest in the quantitative and/or mathematical aspects of chemistry and thermodynamics. I do not know how it compares to similar courses on thermodynamics in the engineering department. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Aspects of chemistry that should be familiar from general chemistry are looked at more in-depth in this course. The workload is one problem set per week that takes at most 3 hours. Most problems are very useful. Tests are fair. Be sure to pay attention in class because the textbook is too vague to be of use without the lecture to supplement and explain it. ",
            "\u00a0Chem 332 with Prof Schmuttenmaer is overall a great chemistry class! Not only is the content fairly interesting, going more into depth mathematically on gen chem content, but Schmuttenmaer add tidbits, both related too chemistry and not really that make the lectures very funny and engaging. The problem sets are mostly from the textbook and so not too bad (4-5 hrs/week), and the section was also run well, which really helpful with solidifying understanding of the material. Tests were also mostly fair, and a good mix of computational and conceptual questions. Posting practice tests with ANSWER KEYS, and homework solutions was also immensely helpful for learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Requirements aside, I think the same knowledge and skills could be gained from reading the Atkins and working on the problems. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking PChem, you probably don't have a choice in the matter. The class was fine overall. Midterms are long, so be prepared to race through questions and to raise your eyebrow at problems about concepts that were covered for 5 min on one day (although the majority should be about the content you practiced). I read the textbook for all the midterms and it was helpful, but some of the tested material is class-exclusive, so fair warning. ",
            "\u00a0As a non chem major I definitely felt that I gained knowledge and skills from this course. However it came at a price of spending a decent amount of time every week when doing the problem sets to really understand the material. If you are at all interested in physical chemistry (ie the physics behind chemistry?) take it. ",
            "\u00a0No. CHEM 332 is quite possibly my least favorite class that I have ever taken (and Im counting the Intro Bio sequence). It isnt a particularly hard class, so I wouldnt expect it to ruin your life, but it is also a class  at least with Schmuttenmaer  that has no interest in teaching you anything. Do not expect to learn. The long lists of equations are presented with no theoretical context except for haphazard derivations in which Schmuttenmaer typically makes a number of mistakes  the equations are never used in class and it is never explained in what context they are to be used, but it doesnt matter because you barely have to use them on the exams, which are almost entirely conceptual. That would be fine if Schmuttenmaer or the relatively poor quality textbook ever taught you the concepts, but they dont. And all of this might at least be tolerable if the course at least covered interesting material, but I am yet to find anyone (including the professor) with any interest in minute changes in the volumes of ideal gases subjected to a wide variety of conditions or mixed with other ideal gases, nor anyone interested in the change in arbitrarily defined quantity A with respect to arbitrarily defined quantity B at constant arbitrarily defined quantity C. Im not kidding  if you were expecting to find anything in this course applicable to any other field, be aware that almost all of the course is focused exclusively on gases pushing on pistons. Dont take it, please  take any other course, a real course with real material that will teach you something, instead. ",
            "\u00a0Not as scary as it sounds! If you take it with Prof Schmuttenmaer, expect to follow along almost verbatim with the textbook (which means if you miss lecture you can catch up pretty easily using the textbook). Lecture itself wasn't all that interesting, but the material itself was pretty cool. The class is more conceptual than quantitative, so don't worry if you didn't do that well in your multivariable calculus class. When it does come up, the math is a pretty rudimentary application of calculus tools. 3 reasonably fair midterms, one final, and weekly psets that take maybe 2-3 hours (and are only worth 5% of the grade). ",
            "\u00a0You're probably taking this course because it's required for your major. But nonetheless, it's a course that's worth taking if you're interesting in thinking and understanding what happens in a given reaction on a molecular level. It teaches you the true definitions of fundamental thermodynamic concepts. While the psets did not count for much of the grade, I'd recommend doing them to get the practice in. Exams were challenging but fair and required you to really know your material well in order to finish on time. ",

Professor Schmuttenmaer is a great teacher, and he makes the class interesting. The class follows closely along with the textbook, so anything you don't understand in lecture you can read up on in the textbook. The assignments are manageable and the exams are fair, as long as you keep up with the material. ",

I'm an MB&B major and took this class the year MB&B pchem wasn't offered, and I'm sad I missed out on taking a pchem class that would actually be relevant to my major- this class seems to make a point of skipping anything that might be interesting or relevant to someone interested in biochemistry (For example at the end of class the instead of doing enzyme kinetics or FRET as an application of the gen-chem level kinetics taught in this class, we instead were taught a ridiculously surface level version of Marcus theory). If you do have to take it for a requirement its not very hard and doesn't require that much work, but it really felt like a waste of time for my interests. ",

The math, though daunting if you have not yet had a science course that uses calculus regularly, is really simple and repetitive.
