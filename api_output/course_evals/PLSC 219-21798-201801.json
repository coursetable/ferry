            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the American environmental movement since the 1950s and the myriad of ways in which it has screwed up (at times depressing, but also super motivating). Definitely made me question some policy positions I held as a Yale Liberal and has inspired me to get way more involved with environmental activism. ",
            "\u00a0Consolidating my argument into three concise pages\r\n\r\nThis course, unlike other environmental policy courses, doesn't just teach you the \"who, what, when, and where\" of environmental politics, it teaches you the \"WHY\" and \"HOW\"- that is, unique American conditions (with helpful comparisons internationally) that lead to undesirable ecological and environmental outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the obstacles impeding environmental policy in America. I feel like this class really did a great job clarifying these obstacles. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the history of the environmental movement, it's different players, facets, and opponents, strategies employed, what worked, what didn't, why. ",
            "\u00a0Politics of the Environment are wild ",
            "\u00a0The readings were amazing. I also learned to self pace myself. Thats about it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the political forces at play in the realm of American environmental policy. ",
            "\u00a0From the readings, I learnt a lot about American politics and how it influences and impacts environmental policy/action. I also learnt how to write papers by drawing inspiration from the readings and write faster. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: covers a lot of material, great discussions, classmates are motivated and bring a huge variety of backgrounds\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes feels a little superficial -- despite the huge amount of material covered, we didn't dig into a lot of it. Discussion tends to be dominated by a few students and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar is defined by the strength of the discussion. Luckily, we had a group of students this year with very diverse educational foci, and I feel like our discussion grew more engaged as the semester went on. I do think that some people got drowned out a bit, not sure if they didn't want to participate, but I would have liked to hear from some of those who didn't speak as much (this is coming from a more frequent participator, so I will accept some of the blame.)\r\n\r\nI also think student presentations should be capped at a certain number of slides or minutes, not just for the sake of time, but because the best presentations were short, to the point, and had a bold and unique (not just recapping the readings) thesis.\r\n\r\nI loved the argument papers- great practice for policy briefs in the future, required full engagement with the readings and allowed one to consolidate their thoughts. Also good idea to require two before Spring Break. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Swenson's comments on the papers was a really helpful aspect of the class. I thought the class discussions we really fun. I liked listening to students' presentations. I really liked the course. ",
            "\u00a0Its a really important and relevant topic and the course was organized well ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely the readings/syllabus and the ability for open discussion during seminar meetings. When people in the class have some background on whatever the week's subject is, or if people were particularly inspired and/or had questions, then discussions could be very interesting.\r\nOn the other hand, the structure of class time was not always the most satisfying. It would usually start with a little bit of lecture about theory (which was useful, but not always engaging), and then go into 2-3 student presentations based on this week's topic. By the time that was done (including time for questions and stuff) class was done. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great readings\r\nWeaknesses: poor use of seminar time.\r\n\r\nJust stick to a schedule better and incorporate readings into seminar more ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great and depending on the class the people know so much about the subject. That being said, the course is not very organized and almost completelt devoid of disuccsion. Also, outside of class time, the professor is not very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good readings, interesting class discussions, argument papers help you engage with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn a lot from readings and your peers who are also within the environmental field. Getting to learn from them and see how they think/what theyve done has been really great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class is structured as a lecture then student led presentation,so we didnt get to go in depth or even talk at all about the readings, which was very frustrating because that was often the most interesting part of the class. Professor Swenson also had very disorganized slides (he copied things from sources without even reading them thoroughly and couldnt explain them to us if we asked specific questions; he often repeated content of slides every few weeks; didnt make any sense and had no structure between slides). It was also really hard to contact him because he didnt always reply tomorrow and when he did it took him a while to do so. Furthermore he has no fixed office hours so its even harder to contact him and I often felt like I had no guidance in doing my papers. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Be prepared for a decent amount of reading and fast-moving discussions and lectures, but you won't find this intersection of real-world politics and environmental issues anywhere else at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is not just a litany of environmental policies. It hones in on WHY and HOW American environmental outcomes are undesirable according to our unique political and cultural institutions- really neat and eye-opening. The workload (readings weekly, four argument papers, two presentations, and a final paper) is manageable. You get out of discussion what you put into it, and Professor Swenson makes sure to select students with diverse educational backgrounds for engaging conversation. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of this seminar, I recommend taking it as an upperclassman. You will get the best experience with background in economics, environmental studies, and political science. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in environmental policy and the obstacles to environmental policy - yes. The readings are really great, and I learned so much. Make sure you have time to do the readings though. ",
            "\u00a0I had high hopes for this class and I do think its important, but we got very little feedback and I dont feel like I learned or improved that much ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Swenson IS NOT an environmental studies professor-- he simply created this course to teach people AND himself about the politics of the environment. In the process, you will learn more about how we are in the current political predicament that we are in than you ever knew possible. This class completely changed they way I saw the environment, and my studies will never be the same! TAKE. THIS. CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this if you would like to expand your understanding of the environmental movement. I was exposed to many different aspects of it which I had not known / thought about before, despite the fact that I was planning on being an EVST major. The class lets you explore whatever aspects of the syllabus you find most interesting, and to develop your own personal understanding of it through several short papers & presentations. I can see how, for some people, it might seem like a lot of re-learned info, but I think it does a good job of putting it all together. Although, I would also say you'll probably only get as much out of this class as you put in ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in understanding how American politics affects our environmental policies. Environmental politics are more nuanced than you would imagine. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who is unfamiliar with environmental policy and American politics and wants to learn more about it. I learnt a lot from the readings and my fellow classmates presentations, and for those two reasons I do not regret taking this class. HOWEVER I would not recommend this class if you are 1. Familiar with environmental politics and its relationship to American politics 2. Need to have a good professor who can teach well. Swenson is disorganized and although he is a really nice guy, he isnt a great Professor and I felt like I learnt more from my classmates and the readings than him. He did give good readings though! "
