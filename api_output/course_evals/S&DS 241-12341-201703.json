            "\u00a0I think this course was pretty strong. The workload was fair and there were a ton of help hours if you ever got stuck on a pset. The lectures could get a bit slow at times but that may have just been because it was at 9am in Davies. ",
            "\u00a0Too easy. When the average on a midterm is a 98 and the median is 100, the course needs to be a little more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook for the course was incredible, and I enjoyed reading it weekly and learned a lot from it.  The homework was manageable but towards the end of the semester it felt like it became less understandable and the problems less clear.  I would prefer more homework problems on the basics in the later chapters to build up before assigning the difficult problems. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat interesting material and good lecturer, but overall moved very slowly, and not in depth, too easy and therefore not engaging ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty easy, which is great! Lectures were hard to focus in mostly because it was a 9 am class, so for higher engagement level I'd move the time. I'm not sure how grading is done, considering there are a decent number of grad students in the class, but I hope undergrads aren't graded compared to grad students. They also have so many office hours, which is great, as there should be a time that works for everyone. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, different TAs grade very differently. It's as if they don't have a grading rubric and just assign points based on how they feel. Because of this, you could get different grades than someone else with the exact same stuff written down on the problem set. They try to account for this by dropping the 2 lowest homeworks, which is mostly fine, but if you get stuck with the most intense grader every time, you'll have consistently lower grades than others. I would give them a rubric so that each step is a certain amount of points, which hopefully should make the grading more uniform. ",

            "\u00a0Pretty good overall. Only complaint was that the midterm was too easy, with most of the class scoring in the 49-50/50 range. Final wasn't too difficult either. The class can definitely be made more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is fantastic. The examples provide a lot of insight on the different topics they teach, and there are tons of useful practice problems with solutions available online. The class very much taught from the textbook, so one could easily have never come to class and been fine just by reading the textbook. ",

If you want to learn the material well, you need to put in the work to do so: not only studying the lecture slides and notes, but also reading the textbook.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was just a generally very good class, but a difficult class that really reflects the amount of work and effort you put in.\r\n\r\nImportant note: definitely, definitely take this class if Winston Lin is teaching. Professor Lin is literally probably one of the best professors I have had in terms of explaining material. He is extremely thorough, and his approach to teaching at least fit my approach to learning perfectly, so I just really enjoyed his class. If I could, I would take any other class he teaches. ",

I appreciated that the midterm was really doable, but wish it were a harder course with a curve. I liked the professor a lot and felt that he was clear and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material isn't too hard to grasp for the most part. If you followed the book and kept up with readings, you should be fine.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: lecture notes and textbook material go well together, instructor does a good job teaching the proofs of theorems in class so that students understand the theorems better, but he does not quiz on the proofs ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: how the course builds up probability theory from scratch. For the most part, the curriculum is pretty well-designed (even though it basically just follows the Blitzstein/Hwang book). The book is generally pretty clear, although gets kind of verbose at times. The depth of the course feels just about right for an intro probability class. Winston did a good job of making clear what we did and didn't need to know (especially helpful for those who don't go to lecture), and telling us which theorems/examples/topics in the book we did and didn't need to know. // Weaknesses: there were certain times when I felt like we could have gone a little more in depth with some of the topics. I also feel like the course was rushed at the end due to time constraints, but perhaps that'll get better. ",
            "\u00a0Thoroughly covered some of the basic topics, and the ending felt a bit rushed/underdeveloped. Reading along with the book definitely helped, but it would be great if the class were paced a bit more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes unnecessarily slowly at the beginning, preventing more in depth discussion of more advanced and interesting material. I'm not very familiar with the 238 material, but I think 241 should provide a better middle ground between jumping directly into something like Advanced Probability and getting a rather cursory overview of (admittedly very interesting) probability theory. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were good summaries of the chapters of the book, but I don't think there was enough engagement to keep me motivated to learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0The class was fine: the lecture was super big so I didn't feel very engaged with the material. And you didn't really need to be super engaged to do well on the homeworks (all the problems were very easy) or the exams. This ended up being a bit problematic, because the average on the midterm was like 49/50, so making a silly small mistake would put you decidedly below the average. I think the Prof in the future should make the exams much harder, so he can discriminate between student's of different ability. Some hard concepts we covered in class, like the fundamental bridge, didn't even show up on the midterm. So there was no way to really demonstrate your knowledge. In the future the Prof should make the homework and the exams harder, to force deeper engagement with the material and so that the grades discriminate based on actual knowledge/ability. ",
            "\u00a0I think this depends a lot on the instructor, but when with Winston:\r\nStrengths: Very easy, psets take about 1 hr a week, lectures are easy to follow, powerpoints available online, well organized, TF's were friendly and helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Ridiculously easy - I learned nothing. Lectures were uninspiring and basically directly from the textbook. I'm a math major, and this class was supposed to be proof based, however, we had no proofs on hw or tests and it was taught much more like a stats class for social science majors ",
            "\u00a0I often ended up watching the Harvard Stat 110 lectures with Joe Blitzstein instead of going to class. I didn't find the lectures to be helpful for learning anything that wasn't already in the book. \r\n\r\nFor improvements, Professor Lin could stay on track by working through more examples while explaining the intuition in a more complete way. I would also gain a lot from a more thorough presentation of the mathematical background of probability. Finally, this may bother some more than others, but I really didn't like how he spent a decent amount of class simply talking about how his slides differ from the book, or how the book's approach is wrong, without explaining why his approach is right (?). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The textbook chosen for the course was laid out well, and helped facilitate an understanding of the material. Generally, the lectures slides were well made, and Professor Lin included very clear and thorough explanations of the concepts along with more intuitive examples in areas where the book fell short. Being able to drop two of the psets was very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is difficult to control this factor, but as someone with little to no probability experience prior to this course, it was challenging being in a class with students who were already intimately familiar with the material and would ask very technical questions that distracted from the core concept being taught. In order to counteract this, the Professor could try to summarize the concept and how it fit into a bigger picture of the material we'd learned at the beginning and end of the lecture to keep the point clear. In addition, I hope homework can count for a little more of the grade in the future rather than placing immense weight on the midterm and final to make up for the 10% placed on homework. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredibly well taught and online material was always updated to make sure students knew what to study and expect. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the class was interesting and well taught and I enjoyed it. In general it's well pitched to someone with a moderate level of math aptitude who has taken multivariable calculus but isn't unusually good at math. The homework and the examples from class are interesting and are not always easy to follow but usually comprehensible if you have a little time to spend thinking about them. The textbook is usually good and provides clear, simple explanations. The one aspect I would change is the pace -- we covered topics very slowly before the midterm and very quickly after it, and I think it might have been better to move at a more constant, intermediate pace throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really good in terms of organization. Winston definitely made an effort to make the material as accessible as possible, and chose a book that contain good examples to look at. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lin is a very thorough lecturer and he assigns very interesting problems. He is always available to answer questions and really cares about student learning. He is also a very good explainer. My only criticism is that the class is rather easy. I wish the material was a little more challenging. ",

I wish that the problem sets were a little bit more challenging and weighted higher. This would allow the course grade not to be based 90% on two tests and would allow the final grade to reflect effort rather than luck. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are how clear the lecture and lecture notes are. I think the lectures could have been a bit more interesting and I think the homework should have been weighted to count for more, but I think it was overall a good course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be recorded ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lin was a very clear and engaging lecturer. He told you what material was going to be on the midterm and final beforehand, what and how to study, and did not try to trick you and put anything wild on either exam. He was also very helpful in office hours as the psets could be quite challenging. Waking up to go to this lecture at 9am on Mondays was extremely difficult however, so if the class time could be changed this course would be improved significantly. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves at a good pace and the slides are extremely helpful when going over stuff outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the professor taught the class for the first time, I felt like he presented the topics is a very logical and easy to follow manner. ",
            "\u00a0I felt the course was overall was too slow and problems sets could have been more challenging. In particular, I felt the first half of the semester could have been taught in 2/3 of the time. Also, the homework problems for this half were usually only straightforward applications of the theorems and did not require a lot of thought. I would have obtained a better understanding if the problems had been more challenging, like those in the chapters of the textbook. I also would have loved to have an introduction to the beta, gamma, and chi-squared distributions.\r\nNonetheless, I thought the course did a good job teaching the basics of probability. I really liked the \"news\" file as it helped me stay on top of the readings and homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class is very well structured and organized, I liked the textbook and it was well integrated, lots of support was available liked the slides that prof. posted.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I went to all the lectures but at times they moved a bit slowly. 9 am meeting time couldn't have helped.\r\nNot a good match between homework problems and exam problems (later were generally easier, and some of the homework problems were unnecessarily tricky)\r\nThe midterm was far too easy which meant the final was more important than it should have been.\r\nFirst half of the term was a lot easier/more review; the hard work in the course was backloaded. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lin clearly cares about teaching the class, is very passionate about the material, and wants to do a good job with the course. He was easy to follow and very diligent about posting slides, clarifying expectations, etc., and also just a nice person, which is always good! I thought the exams were reasonable and fair (though the midterm was too easy: average was 97.6%), making sure we understood the material without expecting us to regurgitate proofs or master clever tricks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: balancing material throughout the semester. The weeks leading up to the midterm felt a little slow to me, which was fine, since it gave me a great grasp on the material we learned. The midterm was also pretty easy, so the average score was really high. Things went okay for another week or so, and then in my view the course just flew off the rails. Everyone else I spoke with felt the same way. Just as we were getting to the more challenging material, the pace of the course picked way up, I got lost very quickly, and never really recovered. Professor Lin still did a good job explaining, but it was just too much, too hard, too fast. I also think the grading allocation is punishingly high-stakes: your grade is either 10% homework, 40% midterm, 50% final, or 10% homework, 15% midterm, 75% final, whichever gives you a better score. One wrong move on either exam will thus really cost you. Adding another midterm and/or increasing the percentage allocated to homework would make this less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The material was fairly basic. The homework came out of the book and wasn't representative of the tests, which was a little annoying. I think having personalized homework problems from the instructor would have been better because as students we would know what is expected of us. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very nice/helpful/accessible professor, tests were fair and aligned well with the homework. Homework was challenging at times but manageable overall. The TFs and ULAs for the course were pretty good overall. \r\nWeaknesses: While Winston lectures well, lecture can feel a bit ancillary since the lecture slides are pretty helpful. Also, while Im not particularly proof-inclined myself, I suspect that if youll want rigorous preparation for S&DS 242 or want a more proof-based treatment of the topics here that you may want to consider taking it with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0Winston is a great lecturer and a great professor. He definitely made the course. It is extremely well organized, fair, and interesting. It is not a course designed to trick you: if you put in the work, it will pay off. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good balance of emphasis on intution, application, theory, and formalism. We learned discrete r.v.s especially well. Core concepts like independence and expectation were hammered home.\r\nWeaknesses: Joint distributions, conditional distributions, conditional expectations (things involving two+ random variables) could have been introduced in the discrete section. More use of plots in lecture can help intuition. Emphasis on computation / application would be nice. I studied Markov Processes at the end of the book on my own; diving into this perhaps to wrap up discrete random variables could be a really cool application.\r\nImprovements: More practice problems expected in homework (you don't understand math, you get used to it). More proofs, some computation. ",

The workload was manageable, and the homework problems seemed to closely match the difficulty of the exams. Weaknesses: The last couple of chapters felt quite rushed (probably because this was Winston's first semester teaching the course, hopefully it'll be better paced in the future!), and I would've liked to spend time on some of the things we skipped.

If you just want a good Stats course that will give you a lot of practical skills this may not be the best course. It's Probability Theory so you don't really learn anything about stats and you don't do much real world probability, it's mostly toy examples. ",
            "\u00a0I find this stuff interesting but I think it can be kind of dry if you don't have to take this class and don't find probability or stats particularly interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Pretty easy class. I took it just because I like stats and wanted more classes in the field. This was a good one to take because it was one problem set a week, one midterm, one final, both of which were relatively easy. If you put some effort in, you should do great. Take it for a relatively easy 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Take the class if you want to know more about probability theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I'd probably recommend it just because I don't think there are many other options out there to learn this material, which is required for most higher level stats and data science courses. Winston Lin is such a nice guy and pretty helpful during office hours, but the course draws entirely from the textbook, so you could easily never go to class and be completely up to date on the material. The homeworks are very light (1-2 hours max per week), the midterm exam was a joke (more than 75% of the class got a 49/50 or higher), and the final wasn't too bad. Makes for a good 5th class if you need to knock out this as a pre-req for your major, otherwise you're probably better off taking something else. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely, definitely take this course, especially if Winston Lin is teaching.\r\n\r\nI would honestly skip over any other introductory statistics class and go straight to 241 because the other intro classes really don't help. 241 IS the class to start in because it actually teaches you concepts in a way that you can actually really understand and remember for the future. With 241, what you learn is the most important, fundamental concepts you need to learn more, and I think that, if taught by the right people, it is an incredible class. Professor Lin is an incredible professor, so take it with him! ",

            "\u00a0It was not a hard class so I would recommend it, especially since I've heard other classes that fulfill the same requirements are a lot harder. The material is interesting if you are interested in probability. It is not an intro to stats so if you are more interested in statistics and useful applications, an intro stats class would probably be better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, all students should probably take a course in stats/probability at some point in their educational careers. I'm not necessarily sure it should be this one unless you're planning to pursue something that needs a good theoretical foundation in probability. This course does what it promises. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over other intro courses, for you get a clearer understanding of different ways to calculate probability as well as why different distributions are used. The exams also weren't too bad. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a great theoretical foundation for \"applied\" stats like S&DS 242 or data analysis. Also, the content is not so difficult. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a more practical introduction to probability, then no, don't take 241. 241 very much focuses on basic concepts of probability (and just probability, not statistics) and the theory behind it, as its name suggests.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to learn the skills in statistics to use in analyzing data in another field, then 241+242 might be worth it, although 238 probably gives you what you need to know, but quicker, and 230 gives you just the data analysis tools.\r\n\r\nHowever if you're looking at majoring in S&DS, Applied Math, or even CS, then 241 is worth taking. 241 isn't an amazing course by any standard, and it's not a \"must take\" since the instruction isn't amazing. But you learn the distributions you need to know and you learn how to work with PDFs/CDFs/transformations/joint distributions/expected value/variance/etc, which is all stuff that you need for basically any other course in the subject. And imo, if you're going deeper into stats/applied math, then learning probability on its own and giving it time to seep in by itself is a good way to build a foundation for later stats courses.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's nice that the course doesn't require any stats knowledge (as so many other intro stat courses, including the 100-series, 220, 230 (I think), 238, and then 241). Gives you a lot to choose from based on what you want. ",

            "\u00a0As far as intro courses in probability, it's either this or 238 so if you're looking for something more sophisticated, 241 is essentially you're only choice. Even though it spends too much time on easy things and doesn't explore more complicated, interesting things in as much detail as it should/would be nice, there's a lot you can get out of the text and unless you're already quite familiar with probability theory, this course does give you a basic, holistic understanding of the field. \r\n\r\ntl;dr If you're interested in probability/stats might as well take it, but don't expect to be fully challenged by the course. Try and dig deeper. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fairly standard class that has to be taken for requirements. Most students taking this class have all ready had some form of Stats background, so the curve will be awful no matter what.

If that is why you want to take this course, so that you learn the theoretical underpinnings necessary for those courses, definitely take this course. If you are looking for a single class to teach you some useful stuff about statistics, take 238 instead. This class is just theory. Workload-wise, this class at least in this iteration was quite simple -- each homework took max 4 hours to do, and lecture notes were available online. If you need help, there is a lot of help available, but at least I (who by no means is good at math/probability) didn't really need to use it. ",
            "\u00a0Depends what you're looking for. If guts in the math major exist this was one of them. However, you won't get much out of it. Or anything.

Professor Lin (Winston) is one of the most kind and understanding professors at Yale, and cares deeply about the well-being of each and every one of his students, particularly those struggling with the material.

He engages students with the material from the ground up, bringing clarity into the often obfuscating math language that other professors fall into. He understands what its like to be a student, and is highly understanding. More importantly, he is socially conscious in his examples  explaining American sports and examples in detail to not disadvantage international students/people who arent immersed in American mainstream culture; using gender non-binary examples and LGBTQ examples with intention and grace; mixing gender pronouns in his examples.

My main issue with the class was how fast it got after the midterm, but this was Professor Lin's first time teaching the course, and I would suspect that he will adjust this for future semesters, assuming others provide the same feedback. You'll definitely have to put in the work to understand the concepts, but that's what math and statistics are all about. ",

We certainly went more in depth with the course, covering more distributions/models/theorems and all with a calculus treatment. Winston is a very nice and accessible professor, homeworks are challenging yet fair, and tests closely model the homeworks and are straightforward for the most part. All in all, a good course with Winston, but be warned that if you need proof-based treatment of the material for the future that youre not going to get it through taking the course with Winston. ",

Although this course is in a sense vegetables (useful to other things like statistics, stochastic processes, randomized algorithms, AI), it is also interesting in its own right. You gain a good intuition about key concepts and get to solve some interesting problems. Winston is a great lecturer and really nice. ",

Winston is very nice and always has his door open to students, but lectures were chocked full of material and very long. The textbook did help tons, but the concepts were still challenging.\r\nPsets were impossible to do without spending time in office hours. Does give you a taste of the Data Science major, I suppose. Maybe if this course were restructured to facilitate learning, I'd have had a better experience. Also, maybe pushing the time back from 9am would help students get through this long class's challenging concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since the material we learn is both useful and fun to learn. ",

He's a great professor, easy to understand and a genuinely kind person it seems who always makes himself available to help his students. The material isn't too difficult and the workload is manageable - weekly problem sets that aren't too long, and a midterm and final. "
