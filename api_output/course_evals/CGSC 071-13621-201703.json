            "\u00a0I learned how to read and evaluate empirical papers and articles, as well as ways to control experimental variables and setup. I also learned a lot about not only how dogs think and behave, but how the relationship between humans and dogs developed over time, as well as how science and the public interact. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the minds of dogs in just one semester, I also learned how to design cognitive science experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about dogs, animal cognition and dog cognition. I got to experience a cognitive science course (which I probably never would have done if this course hadn't been offered), and I learned how to read, analyze, and interpret scientific studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read papers deeply and question their methods. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insight into not only how the mind of a dog works but also a lot of experience with reading scholarly journal articles which made up the bulk of the readings students did. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about dog cognition and the evolution of dog domestication. I also learned the basic skills of designing a scientific experiment. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I had no background in psychology or cognitive science. I entered the course simply being interested in dogs and I learned so much about them. From reading numerous empirical articles, I learned what humans think dogs understand. Additionally, I learned a lot in general about animal cognition, and why it is so hard (technically impossible) to understand how other species think. I learned how to analyze scientific experiments and to figure out both their strengths and weaknesses. This was apparent in the final paper, where we created a canine cognition experiment something I would have totally tanked had we not read those other epirical articles in class, ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good introduction to the approaches taken to answer questions in the field of animal cognition. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to read empirical articles, draw connections between canine and human cognition, and develop my own research design. ",
            "\u00a0We analyzed the scientific way to study the cognitive behaviors of dogs by reading a lot of empirical papers. We learned some facts on dogs in general and more on the studies about them. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned how to navigate reading a scientific article, plan my time revolving a larger essay, and of course more about how a dog thinks. ",
            "\u00a0From a practical standpoint, this course taught me to critically analyze  scientific papers (particularly in the social sciences). Beyond this, though, I gained a whole new perspective on our relationship throughout history with dogs. I didn't even know that canine cognition was a field of study before I learned about this course; as it turns out, it is a really cool interdisciplinary field that's at the intersection of many relevant issues today. Studying dogs is fun in and of itself, but it can also answer questions about how and why many species evolved to where they are today.\r\n\r\nAlso, the workload was manageable, and the content was very accessible at the beginning. Complicated topics were built from the ground up as the semester went along; I had never taken a cog. sci., psychology, statistics, or other related course before, and following the class' arc was never a problem.

            "\u00a0It was very interesting material that I had never learned before and engaged my interest in cognitive science. The subjects were interesting to read and write about, and the professor was very friendly and caring towards each student. I do wish that participation would have been more targeted towards all of the students, since during most of the discussions it was the same 4 or 5 people talking and other students had no opportunity to add their insight. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting content, great teacher, good structure with the seminar style.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dean Ruiz grades bibliographies a bit too harshly in my opinion, which makes getting good grades on assignments a lot harder than it should be. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fantastic course. I really think that it was well designed, thorough, engaging and fun. To improve, I think there were a few readings that could've been eliminated and replaced with better ones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: minimal work, lets you think deeply, trips and interactive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didn't have a clear format, it was very discussion based, slides to guide the class may have helped ",
            "\u00a0This class was really good at engaging students with an enjoyable topic. I enjoyed being able to get to know other freshman through this course, especially through the partner presentation assignment. The readings were also very interesting and the workload was fairly light. However, I wish grades were posted more regularly. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting, and I enjoyed the readings. I wish we did more activities in class, such as group work. Discussing the readings in the same manner each class period felt repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed as a seminar, and I think that was the perfect way for it to be. I have only one improvement that I would make if I were to teach the class; I would want the reading responses to be more focused. They were very open ended, and while that is good to facilitate discussion, I feel that we didnt use them to their full potential. I understand that the purpose of a reading response was to check whether or not you had done the reading, but I think  it would have been good to incorporate them into the discussion more. ",
            "\u00a0The course load was very heavy on reading and less heavy on writing, but I feel like it would be helpful if we could focus more on how to write a research proposal. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the small seminar style of the course promoted engaging and intimate discussion. Additionally, trips to the canine cognition center and the final research paper gave me a better sense of how experiments are designed, conducted, and analyzed.\r\n\r\nAt times, I found the class discussions to be redundant. I wonder if we could have explored canine cognition through texts other than empirical articles. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the papers got very repetitive towards the second half of the semester, and every discussion ended up being the same. It was really nice to be able to discuss the papers in a small seminar like this class as a freshman, but there seemed to be not enough material to support a semester. I feel like if it was changed to be a WR credit course, there would be more reasons to take this class and more to get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the discussion of the class and always felt that my ideas were valued and taken into account. Sometimes the class could feel a little repetitive with the same format every day, but I really enjoyed when we mixed it up like when we broke into small groups to try to plan a different study with the strings. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: continuous student conversation, and training to quickly and critically read empirical articles \r\nweaknesses: assignment monotony that was all reading, reading, and reading (and some writing) empirical articles \r\nimprovement: a variety of assignments or reading pieces "

            "\u00a0It's a great first-year seminar, especially if you have an interest in cognitive science or psychology. You get to really connect with other first-years in the course without having to worry about excessive workload. You learn a lot about the scientific method and how to evaluate scientific papers, which should come in handy if you're thinking about doing research. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyonenot only those interested in dogs (although it does make the class more fun). It was well-taught, the material is not impossible to digest, and (as trite as it sounds) you will get a lot out of it if you put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class to take whether you're interested in majoring cognitive science or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Ruiz is incredibly dedicated and receptive to her students, especially during office hours. She drew such interesting parallels between human and canine cognition and helped us reevaluate the human canine relationship and what we interpret as intelligence. ",
            "\u00a0If you love dogs, take it -- it's a fun class to get practice reading empirical papers in the context of dogs. Just don't expect to get too much out of it. Dean Ruiz is amazing and the environment is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It took a subject that I already loved, dogs, and expanded how I thought about them. It was also a nice introduction into what cognitive science might be like. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to others. You have to enjoy the course's content and be OK with reading scientific articles, but it is a really cool introduction to a topic you may have never really considered before. Dean Ruiz clearly did a lot to make sure we enjoyed each class (she asked us to send her dog memes any time, and each class would start with a \"moment for memes;\" she would virtually introduce us to dogs we may see around campus, and their respective handlers; once she brought her own dog for a visit), and she tailored our readings as we went along based on what it seemed like we were interested in and with regard to the pace we were comfortable handling. I think the seminar style made it really enjoyablesometimes Dean Ruiz would lecture to help us understand some background, but in general she would just guide conversationand helped us all more deeply understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they love dogs and science! "
