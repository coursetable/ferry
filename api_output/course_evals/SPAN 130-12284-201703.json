            "\u00a0I improved on my grammar and developed better reading comprehension and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish speaking skills improved significantly, with sizable increases in vocabulary and reading comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking skills developed incredibly. Since the class is taught entirely in Spanish, you are forced to improve both your comprehension and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my Spanish tremendously this term -- not only conversationally, but I also learned so much grammar and conjugation over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I further developed my ability to correctly speak and comprehend all manner of Spanish. I also know that I learned a fair bit of new vocabulary, some further, finer points of Spanish (especially regarding the subjunctive), and more on the culture of Spanish-speaking areas of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of work, but provides great practice in developing your Spanish skills. Make sure you stay on track with the daily work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about advanced Spanish grammar and Hispanic culture. My proficiency in reading and speaking was worked on during this course. ",
            "\u00a0I furthered my abilities to speak, read, comprehend, and write Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Became a better speaker overall. Tested my grammatical skills well. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped develop my knowledge of Spanish language and culture. Daily language practice in class made it easy to learn more about the language. The professor also held regular office hours, which were important for developing conversational Spanish. The music played in class was interesting, and one of the best parts of the course. "

        [
            "\u00a0The structure of the syllabus was a strength in the sense that the course was easy to follow along with and stay organized. It could be improved with the textbook because the textbook introduced all the grammar topics in English, but then in class we only spoke in Spanish so it was sometimes difficult to apply what we read/studied the night before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the short-stories were great, the exams were mostly fair (though not always); discussions in class were excellent; the teacher was knowledgeable, fair, and overall wonderful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: extremely poor syllabus (some days were too much work, some were little); the essays required too much of students (too many guidelines that the essay felt contrived); oral evaluation was artificial ",
            "\u00a0I had trouble speaking and conveying complex ideas, but throughout the course, I gained confidence in my abilities and began speaking more freely.\r\n\r\nMy strength was in grammar, but I was often times too unsure of my abilities to use more complex structures. At the end of this course, I feel comfortable enough to attempt more challenging sentences. ",
            "\u00a0The workload is very heavy. Each night, you have work to do, and it begins to feel very tedious. When you are studying for an exam, you still have other Spanish work you need to be doing. At times, it feels more overwhelming than it needs to be. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the separation of units, and I think they do a good job of mixing in different means of learning (movies, stories, etc.) with the units. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very comprehensive and overall the intensity of class helped improve my language proficiency. One weakness of the course was the inconsistency between the rigor in sections. ",
            "\u00a0Because it's conducted entirely in Spanish, this course is certainly strong in regards to how it forces students to quickly improve their ability to understand spoken Spanish.\r\n\r\nAnd as someone who thought they'd covered the entirety of Spanish grammar in high school (tenses, rules around adjectives and gerunds, etc.), I was surprised by how much new material and grammar I learned or strengthened. I think the course could be useful even to those who have learned all of the tenses and major grammatical rules since, as this course makes quite clear, there is always more to learn. I would also say that the instructor, or curriculum in general, does a good job of incorporating new grammar rules and vocabulary as they're learned, both into written course materials and the conversation/discussion.\r\n\r\nI'd say that the in-class discussions are another strong point of the course. However, I would also say that providing more opportunities for in-class public speaking (so that those who do the best in discussions and seminars don't end up having as dramatically much speaking time) could help to improve verbal outcomes for EVERY student. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, having homework every night was very burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the variety of texts and visual resources utilized to truly master the grammar and content in the syllabus. A weakness is the inconsistency of grading across the sections and the subjectivity of the written portions of exams, oral exams, and participation grades. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was how highly organized it was and how each test and quiz had a study guide that you could follow to ensure you knew all the material you needed to know for each test. A weakness is that I want more speaking skills to be developed. I would like more conversational speech as opposed to learning how to decipher literature. I want to be able to speak with Spanish speaking people in the streets with appropriate slang. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were its material and teaching. The syllabus was diverse, and the stories that we read for class were interesting. Dario was a great instructor who made it very easy to learn. The weaknesses of this course were its homework system and its grading. The website used for homework was troublesome. Grading was sometimes a bit arbitrary, and there was no curve. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but I think the instructor is a very important aspect. I enjoyed going to class with my instructor so that definitely influenced my opinion of the course overall. ",
            "\u00a0Recommend as part of the Spanish sequence. Will help you improve your Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0Fun, but engaging. Enriching both your language and culture skills. A strong bond with other students and the teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is very motivated to learn the language. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course -- you learn a lot (both breadth-wise and depth-wise) and get a ton of practice over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good class to take to fulfill a language requirement and it is a step towards more interesting upper level Spanish classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would -- I think it does a good job of improving one's general Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0If they wished to continue learning spanish, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I loved the outline of the lessons and class itself was very engaging and helped you learn to speak Spanish, something that is difficult but necessary if you plan to actually apply your learned language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially with Dario as the instructor. His class was filled with lively conversation, cool music, and interesting material. It taught language and culture very well, and I am better off for having taken it. "
