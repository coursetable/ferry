            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot of theory about sex, gender, and sexuality. One of the most important skills I practiced was applying generally abstruse theoretical knowledge to more concrete, real life examples. Coming out of this course, I think I am a better critical reader and a more competent writer. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a solid foundation in WGSS theory, both older foundational texts (Freud, Foucault, etc.) and more contemporary texts. Writing the thinkpieces taught me to make connections and identify overarching themes between theoretical texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read and analyze difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class having a completely misguided idea of what WGSS might be as a field of study, but this class made me quickly learn exactly what WGSS is and how important and relevant it is to everybody's lives. The material was VERY challenging and you definitely have to work hard to get through the assigned readings but 90% were absolutely necessary to beginning to understand gender studies. ",
            "\u00a0Everything, this course blew my mind ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read dense theory, about hegemonic systems of power, and how to synthesize different texts to create a meaningful dialogue. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the expansive areas of women's, gender, and sexuality studies literature. I learned more about the discipline and developed many of my own insights. However, I feel like this course did not help me develop many skills. The way it was taught did not make possible much skill development, even though I learned a lot about women's, gender, and sexuality studies work and theory. "

            "\u00a0I had a lot of problems with this course. On one hand, a decent majority of the readings were interesting, but the reading load was much too heavy to the point where I could barely engage with the readings I liked in order to finish them all. The three think pieces we had to hand in throughout the semester were a good exercise and good preparation for the final paper, but they were way too much work to be graded on a check-check plus scale. I felt at times like I was putting in a lot of work and that Professor Pepi wasn't always doing the same. Granted, her comments on the think pieces were helpful guidance, but on the whole, we got little to no feedback throughout the semester even though we were regularly handing in these think pieces and writing blog posts for every week's reading. The turnaround time on the think pieces--three page reading responses that no more than five or six people turned in each week--was much too long, and Professor Pepi got defensive and tried to make us feel guilty for asking for them. The night before my third one was due, I still hadn't gotten my second one back even though I had turned it more than two weeks earlier. When I asked for it, she made me feel like a burden and essentially complained to me about having to grade it that night. Frankly, the main issue I took with this course was the way we spent class time. Professor Pepi spent a lot of time unabashedly lecturing in our twelve-person seminar, and even when we were supposed to be having a class discussion, she often ended up dominating the discussion. That's all well and good considering she knows the most about this topic by far, but I was so excited on the first day to learn from the other people in my class, and I did not have that experience at all. Even when the floor was open, I think that Professor Pepi created a classroom environment where people were hesitant to speak up and speak to each other because there was always the chance that she'd interrupt and direct the discussion how she wanted it to go. Sometimes her interjections were a lot less relevant or insightful than the points that other members of my class were in the middle of making. Once she stopped class discussion for at least fifteen minutes to talk about her own medical history. Even when I gave a presentation for the whole class one week, Professor Pepi constantly interrupted and eventually just asked if she could switch seats with me and my co-presenter so she could sit in the front of the room. She was also prone to asking incomprehensible questions (that were hard to recognize as questions in the first place), and predictably, when no one answered, she made comments that implied she didn't believe we did the reading, which, even if it was true some weeks in some cases, wasn't really fair. When I met with her one on one or in a smaller group, I found her to be condescending and not so helpful--once I tried to ask her for help understanding a reading I found difficult (one that I was supposed to present on the next week), and she pretty much just told me that I should understand it (without giving any guidance as to how) and then spent most of the rest of the meeting giving me tips for presenting, like \"stand up\" and \"make eye contact.\" Writing my final paper was my favorite part of the course because I could do whatever I wanted, but even then, when I asked Professor Pepi to meet a full five days before the paper was due, she said she had no time and that she wasn't helping any students at all at this point and I should have come to office hours the week before (which was the last week of classes, during which I had other finals--duh!). She only had one hour of office hours per week to begin with, and you couldn't just show up; you had to make an appointment in advance, and she wouldn't see you if you hadn't. On the whole, I found this class to be increasingly frustrating as the semester went on, in large part due to Professor Pepi herself. ",
            "\u00a0More texts by people of color, more texts on transgender identity, more explanation of dense theoretical texts, discussion of how gender studies sometimes perpetuate colonial discourse by ignoring Native American work and perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely interesting but there is a ton of reading. ",
            "\u00a0- Less weekly readings or at a minimum, more evenly distributed \r\n- More regular feedback on performance in the class ",
            "\u00a0I think there needed to be a bit more explanation of the readings. Even just a short five minute explanation, especially for the very dense pieces. I think that would help so much! But otherwise, discussion was very engaging for everyone (more than I've seen in any of my other seminars so far). ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the texts were well chosen and discussion flowed well. A way it could be improved is if there were more introduction and direction in reading the text. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a diverse number of areas within WGSS, but we were given way too much information/reading each week to truly be able to discuss and process what we were reading and learning. This course could improve by covering the same number of areas, but by really decreasing the reading load. There were so many weeks where there were a number of texts that we weren't able to discuss in the two hour lecture. In the future, it would be better if students could focus on fewer texts to engage with them more actively when reading them and during class. In addition, sometimes, Professor Pepi would lecture about a certain topic for a good amount of time. These lectures were definitely helpful, but further detracted from us being able to engage with the readings and topics of the week. In the future, I would keep the lectures (they were interesting and useful) but definitely narrow down what we were expected to read and discuss. There are readings in the class that I literally do not remember doing and did not take anything away from because I had to read them quickly and then we didn't even end up discussing them in class. That's just ridiculous -- I want to engage with what I read meaningfully, and reading those articles just took time away from reading the ones we ended up discussing in class. Overall, I did like the course material that we covered. However, there was very little skill development for me and I feel that I did not improve in writing due to the poor structure of how the class assignments were set up. Professor Pepi gave little to no explanations on how to approach the think pieces, final paper proposal, and final paper, leaving many students confused and having to figure it out for themselves. Professor Pepi did not offer any type of rubric on how to meet and exceed expectations for the assignments. Instead, she expected us to figure this out on our own, which left us feeling very behind. I would have appreciated more instructions regarding how to write a WGSS paper or proposal and what I could do to set myself apart from my classmates. "

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to a non-WGSS major. It is much too dense and too theoretical to help you think about real-life issues in a meaningful way. The final paper was the first time I wrote about actual events, and that was my choice. There were times in class when I was shut down for asking practical questions because they were \"outside the scope of the course.\" I don't know if this is a problem with this professor, this course, or this department, but I do know that it turned me off, especially as someone who will probably never think about these issues in such rigorous theoretical detail again. I also found Professor Pepi to be one of the more condescending professors I've had at Yale, and I didn't like the way she ran class at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - especially for prospective majors. This is just a good foundational course in learning how to engage in academic WGSS discussions. It gives an idea of what the field of WGSS entails. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely recommend. It's one of those classes that changes your perspective and I can see why its required for WGSS majors, but I would recommend it to non-majors as well! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in WGSS. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if that person wants to learn the basics of Gender Studies and learning how to read texts critically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student if they wanted to learn about the many different areas that WGSS covers. However, since this course does not offer much skill development, I would recommend that the student already have some experience in writing theoretical or WGSS papers and discussing them in class. "
