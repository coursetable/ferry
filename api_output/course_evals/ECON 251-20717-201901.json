            "\u00a0Foundations of finance, pretty much everything you would need to ace an investment banking / equity research interview besides the accounting stuff ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the ins and outs of finance. very challenging ",
            "\u00a0Mostly asset pricing and mechanics of different types of financial instruments (bonds, stock, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the basic financial concepts behind the sales and trading and asset management. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of financial theory including asset valuation, bonds, options etc. ",
            "\u00a0How to evaluate various securities and understand various components in the financial sector. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first finance class I've taken and it was incredibly insightful. I learned about financial instruments, portfolio choice theory, the CAPM, and have acquired a general better understanding of financial markets. ",
            "\u00a0Foundational theory and math behind finance. We learnt the motivations behind financial mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about Financial systems and their working. ",
            "\u00a0Finance backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0This course was foundational in my understanding of modern finance. It surveyed a number of key concepts and insights, any of which could merit a course on their own, in a consistent and coherent overarching narrative. I venture to conjecture that, in many years' time, my livelihood will depend on some of those concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of the economic intuition and the building blocks behind the financial system. I learned how to understand a lot of the specific jargon and machinery present in the system, and found that I have made a fundamentally sound base on which to continue my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. I went from not even really understanding the present value formula to being about to price any security, including options and futures. ",

            "\u00a0No weaknesses! Content was very straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the course material was presented very quickly and there couldve been better guidance for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was well structured. However the lectures were covered very rapidly and I wish they had been done at a slower pace. Furthermore, I feel like it was unnecessary to  require students to memorize formulas prior to the examination. ",
            "\u00a0This course has very interesting material and was taught extremely well in lecture, but section wasn't very engaging or helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was particularly good. I like that it was all provided at the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is incredible ",
            "\u00a0I think the concepts covered were interesting, but the volatility in the pace of the course made it feel overwhelming at times. I think it could easily be improved by: (1) teaching one lecture in depth per class session (rather than rushing through a lecture, then starting next weeks class because we have extra time) and (2) simply including better equations that specify what variables are used (slides often wouldnt clarify this). ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well taught: it particularly excelled in providing intuitive explanations to technically complex financial principles, and in instilling a few key tools that can be used to value any financial security. Wonderful and exciting! The online material was fantastically comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0it is a very structured course. I hope there is more invigorating conversations and interesting examples in the class ",
            "\u00a0I thought most of the course relied on online resources provided via canvas. The lectures themselves were well-organized and clearly taught by the professor, making it clear what the expectations were for the class. The material itself I found to not be too challenging, although I recognize that any further expansion into certain topics would warrant more mathematics beyond the scope of the class. I do want to comment that I found discussion sections not to be useful considering the solutions to many of the practice problems given were online, and it didn't help that discussion sections were not mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are how clearly the information is presented and how many resources Davila provides you to help you master the material. ",
            "\u00a0It was both intuitive and mathematical at the same time, which makes the students work hard to understand it and that is very good. "

            "\u00a0yes! very helpful if you are going into finance. taught in a very clear manner, psets not too bad. very good TAs ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - this is one of the only classes in Yale College that teaches the foundations of finance. You won't find this content in any other Econ department course. There are a lot of extra math-y quantitative deriving stuff in the extra materials, but you won't be expected to know it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this class to another student. This class is poorly taught for the most part, and the material that you learn can honestly be self-taught if you so choose. I worked in a sales & trading division at bulge bracket bank, and I can say that very little of what we learned in class is really applicable to the kind of work that you'd imagine this class is meant to inform you on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it to someone whos new to finance and wants to gain fluency with the language. ",
            "\u00a0I would to another student who is interested in learning the basics of finance ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was extremely interesting and I feel that I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0For a student looking for a challenge who is interested  in the financial industry, I would recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about finance from this course. Professor is an incredible teacher. ",
            "\u00a0This course caters to students passionate or curious about finance. It can rapidly escalate in technical content, but the instructor did a commendable job of making the material approachable to all levels of mathematical and statistical expertise. ",
            "\u00a0i would probably prefer to take the same class but with Geanakoplos ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps - I took this class out of interest and because I wanted to learn more about financial theory in an organized setting. Ultimately, I felt that I could have learned much of the material in this class by myself over the summer, and so would suggest taking another class anyways. However, I definitely did get what I wanted out of the class and would encourage those who are interested in the material to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course, particularly if you don't have a strong finance background. The material is intellectually challenging without being scary and Davila is great at explaining it. The course and the additional materials that Davila really facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - Prof. Davila has so much material and practice and he really wants you to succeed "
