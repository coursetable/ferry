            "\u00a0Elementary Japanese is a very rigorous course designed to facilitate effective and rapid learning. My vocabulary, intonation, conversational skills, writing skills, speaking skills, and kanji knowledge have definitely improved. This course also requires the development of healthy continuous study habits. ",

            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course may be some relatively ineffective materials, such as certain songs used for homework media assignments. However, even these are not a downfall, as they added texture to class materials. A distinct strength of the course is the environment, created by passionate sensees and hardworking students. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves way too fast. It was to the point where my classmates had no idea what was going on some days because we were still trying to learn the information just given to us. This inhibited my ability to speak because I was never able to fully grasp some concepts. I also didn't like the rotating teachers. It made it hard to get used to a style of learning because they were all so different \r\nI enjoyed the exercises in class and the daily homework was engaging. The course is very comprehensive and I was impressed by what I was able to learn in the amount of time we had. ",
            "\u00a0I think all of the teachers are very good in their teaching methods, however I would at least prefer we were notified that we would constantly be switching professors beforehand. I was caught off guard, not understanding if my professor was just sick, or what was happening for the first few times they were gone. ",

            "\u00a0If you legitimately want to learn Japanese I would recommend. The professors are very good and I definitely have enjoyed the experience. If you just want to fulfill a language requirement however, Japanese is a difficult language to learn and requires a lot of work, so I would recommend you only take it if you are passionate. The enthusiasm will certainly help the work feel better. ",

            "\u00a0Yes--not only is Japanese a fun language to learn, the Japanese faculty make it 10 times more worth it. Their passion for teaching Japanese is unparalleled and I am so glad to have them as mentors and to be able to have worked with them everyday this semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much more Japanese than I thought I could in just a few months.  Even though the workload is high, it is a necessary challenge for learning the language, and the course was still fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am amazed at how much I have learned from L1 already. The class is quite intensive and demanding of time and effort, but it is extremely worth it, just based off how much I have learned. "
