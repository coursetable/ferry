            "\u00a0I have learned how to read and write throughout this course when I could not before. I have read works by authors that my parents have been telling me to read for years now. ",
            "\u00a0A continuation of the grammar and concepts covered in RUSS122, with a bigger emphasis on literature and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly developed my Russian skills in all aspects. This class inspired me to really reconnect with my heritage. ",
            "\u00a0Bettering written Russian skills. More advanced vocab ",
            "\u00a0From a heritage speakers base and after the first semester, we further developed grammatical and formal writing, formal speaking, and literary analysis. I can now read faster and harder material, speak with fewer errors, and write mostly grammatical text. "

            "\u00a0good engagement of the class ",
            "\u00a0This course has a good workload and did a really good job of improving my Russian. If possible, one area I would still like to improve on is my Russian spelling. It can sometimes be difficult to spell words from just sounding them out, and the orthographic rules we learned, while very useful, do not cover all cases. I'm not sure if at this point it is just more experience and practice with the language that is necessary, or if there is something that can be added to the course to help with this. ",
            "\u00a0Although workload heavy, this class not meeting every day really lightens the overall stress of the course and strikes an even balance. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that we read frequently and hold discussions (as well as have plenty of homework to practice). One weakness is that discussions arent always very active, and that some people feel nervous speaking/interacting. It would be nice to make sure the environment in the future makes people feel more comfortable to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: small class size, very personable\r\n\r\nWeakness: wish there was more speaking involved in class, less grammar lecturing ",
            "\u00a0The seminar learning was a strength, and Prof. Titus would do well to give everyone chances to read, practice written exercises verbally, and discuss the reading. Everyone practices formal speaking with a prepared presentation once per term that helped me improve. \r\nThe work included written grammatical exercises and reading with active vocabulary from the text. Sometimes it was a lot, but that is what it takes to learn Russian. I would not list workload as a weakness. "

            "\u00a0Yes, very fun and interesting class ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this class to a student who is serious about improving his or her Russian. You will definitely further improve in areas including writing and grammar after this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I cannot recommend this course enough. Coming in with a rudimentary knowledge of the Russian language, I have since learned to read beyond my level, write in Cyrillic from scratch, and have been able to communicate with my family members like I never could before. I have also managed to make business calls, write business emails, and even begin to flirt in Russian - something that I never thought would be possible. This class was the highlight of my year, if you are deciding between this and any other language class, please keep your Russian. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you come from a Russian-speaking household this class is a perfect way to keep up the language while you're away at college and learn the proper grammar behind some of your intuition. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely, as I mentioned before, it made me reconnect to my heritage in a way that I have been seeking for some time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definetely. Great class to keep up your Russian without much stress. Totally take if you qualify for it, and the prof is very chill and great. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a student with exposure to Russian and continuing from the first semester. I was a confident speaker from conversation at home, but I was unable to write (just knew the alphabet) and a slow reader at the start of the first semester. By this second semester, I had seen much progress, and I continued. This course had you write and read for it, but I finished with a confidence in grammatical writing and formal speaking and reading.
