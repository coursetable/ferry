            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of the biology/specific science behind cancer; I learned that cancer is not a singular disease but is many diseases, particular to each individual. I also learned how to read (and understand) scientific articles, as well as how to use to scientific databases and write a scientific paper with Word/EndNote creating the Works Cited page for me (I had no idea that feature existed before this class). This class also helped me develop logical thinking skills to understand how and why cancer can occur and why certain mechanisms are more detrimental or helpful to a cancer's survival. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about cancer. I also learned - a skill I never acquired from science classes in high school that usually depended on rote memorization - how to take facts learned and really think critically about them to figure out how they relate to one another and their real world applications. In this class, you can't just memorize facts - you have to REALLY understand the big picture. Thinking so critically about science is a skill I never really considered, but I'm glad I've done it - my brain feels like it has had a real work-out. Professor Belperron also does a great job of teaching a very cumulative class - every new thing you learn builds on something else you have previously learned. Thus, by the end, you can really use your knowledge of previous topics to understand complex new concepts you could not have otherwise. Such is incredibly rewarding. Reading and discussing the Emperor of All Maladies also taught me about the interactions of science and politics - an incredibly relevant topic I had not ever considered. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more science behind cancer than I thought I would at the semester. As non-stem major, by the end of the semester, I felt that I could confidently sit in on a scientific lecture about cancer and be able to follow along. ",
            "\u00a0deep understanding of the intricacies of cancer ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about the biology of cancer. Seriously, I feel so much smarter after taking this class than I did before. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much about cancer, but also biology in general, which I hadnt previously known. For someone who isn a science person, it was pretty in depth, but definitely also taught things that you hear about all the time and should know. ",
            "\u00a0the scientific mechanisms behind cancer development and its treatment. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the biochemistry and pathogenesis of different types of cancer and then biological understanding of treatment options. I was truly able to understand countless molecular and cellular biological concepts that previously I would have never understood. ",
            "\u00a0Biological knowledge of how cancer forms, metastasizes, how carcinogens and environmental forces create cancer, the immune system's role in cancer, the role of diet and nutrition in the prevention of cancer, as well as the biology of chemotherapies, radiation, and immunotherapies in treating cancer.

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed getting such an in-depth look at cancer; I really liked how Professor Belperron had us read The Emperor of All Maladies for the class. I was not a fan of the intro to cancer book we read--I felt that it was too simple for the science that we ended up discussing, and its metaphors were very elementary--Perhaps a better introductory book could be assigned so that students get more out of the reading. \r\n\r\nI liked the laminar--Lecture/seminar--set-up; Professor Belperron's metaphors and ways of explaining the material really helped me understand in ways I could not understand when I had to read the powerpoints on my own after I had missed a class. \r\n\r\nI feel like something that could make the course better for future classes might be introducing a field trip aspect--so that humanities majors like me can say that they've actually been to science hill and so that there can be a more first-hand experience with scientists actually developing the ideas/understanding which we studied. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are a wonderful, kind, and engaging professor, reading the Emperor of All Maladies, and the fact that you come away having learned more than you ever thought you could. The course also relies heavily on class participation/casual seminar style discussion, which allows you to really grapple with the material and boost your grade by doing so. There is very little reading or homework, but the quizzes are very difficult and incredibly rushed. It feels that the quizzes are a mere race against the clock - they are incredibly stressful and quite demanding, requiring a LOT of creative thinking - never just regurgitation of facts. I feel that if the point of a quiz is to prove how well we know and can use the material, we should be given more than just twenty minutes to answer many very complex questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredibly informative, but that is also its weakness. It is a lot of information to grasp and there is little to no participation in class making difficult to reinforce knowledge. I did like that there was book that was read throughout the semester as well as presentation on a specific cancer which allowed students to show that they understood the material even if they weren't the best test takers. The test were also a little too hard because the test average was always in the low 70s. ",
            "\u00a0more engaging lectures ",
            "\u00a0This is one of those classes that really make you feel smarter for having taken it. I learned so much about scientific research and science in general. The material is also very relevant. In addition, Professor Belperron teaches the class in way that is very accessible to students (but make sure you take good notes in class). However, the quizzes and midterm are hard af (but they are curved). ",
            "\u00a0There were no weaknesses- it was an amazing course. One of the strengths is the size - only about 15 students in the course so it was held twice a week, seminar style. Professor Belperron was unbelievably helpful in attempting to portray extremely difficult material in an approachable way. The assignments were difficult but fair, and they pushed me to study diligently so that I truly understood the concepts we were tested on. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly difficult, but so rewarding and so interesting. I've never taken a class like it at Yale, and I'm sure I never will again. If you want a challenge, take it! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0YES! I took this course with an already heavy course load, but I felt that the work I put in was very beneficial to me and to my understanding of cancer. None of the readings were extraneous--only beneficial. It is definitely not a gut science credit, but it is a class you can take and feel like youre getting useful, applicable information out of. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who wanted to learn about cancer and was willing to put in a lot of work. It is absolutely not a gut, but Professor Belperron ensures that anyone who takes this will learn so much. If you like biology and want to really learn to think very critically and apply the material, take this course. If you are looking for a mildly to moderately demanding course, do not take Cancer. ",
            "\u00a0I think if you have any interest in cancer and our willing to do the work, it is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but not if you are looking for an easy science credit. Take it if you are interested in actually learning something from your science credit and are willing to put in the extra effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great Professor and you will learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for anyone who really does want to learn and be challenged because I think the material is very interesting, but I would just warn you that it was definitely a hard class that required a lot of time studying and was not easy to get a good grade in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to every student at Yale. It was probably my favorite course that I have ever taken, and I hope that everyone who is remotely interested in cancer gets the chance to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants to be challenged to learn the in-depth and nuanced biology of cancer and its means of treatment. "
