            "\u00a0I learned how various energy systems undergird Western economics and politics and developed a more critical understanding of how transitions to renewable energy could reproduce unjust structures that plague the U.S.'s oil-based economy. ",
            "\u00a0Intricate relationships between energy structures and power mostly in the US. We looked at a variety of energy sources ranging from fossil fuels to renewables, learning to think critically about all energy options and the role we play as consumers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to think critically about common assumptions regarding energy systems in the US and internationally, and to examine and complicate those assumptions from an anthropological perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Really challenged the way I looked at energy and its accompanying structures. I felt like I came away from nearly ever week reevaluating my thoughts on energy. You gain a lot of nuanced insight on how power props up the ways by which we use energy. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first anthropology course, and made me want to do way more in the anthropology department. We perfectly walked the line between theoretical understanding and grounded, real-world applications (especially considering the theoretical learning we could consider through studying the day-to-day world). Among the best courses I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about power, in every sense of the word, and its role within society that shape the various dynamics and interactions we witness today. ",
            "\u00a0Learned new ways to conceptualize power and the energy system -- this course gave me the terms and framework to describe concepts that I have seen play out in the energy system. Very glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think of energy beyond the use that engineers and others make of it, to search and find the relation of networks of energy to power and to think critically of the role that energy plays in other social systems. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course has a fantastic syllabus that forces students to broaden their conception of energy and come to terms with the uncomfortable ways that energy systems produce and reproduce power imbalances. I also appreciated that the course asked students to write an energy journal throughout the semester; I felt that this allowed me to engage the weekly readings on a more personal level. The only aspect of the seminar I thought could be improved was the format of some of our weekly discussion. Occasionally, when there were many assigned readings, students were divided into groups to discuss one piece before everyone reconvened at the end of class. I felt like these group conversations were slightly disorganized and detracted from the otherwise lively talks I came to expect from the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings, course organization, professors, seminar set up, feedback, assignments\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The readings were often insightful and forced me to adjust my views on energy. Professors were equally as insightful and were really intent on challenging our comments/tying them to larger themes, which led to productive discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible readings (though sometimes too many in a single week). The professors also did a great job of bringing additional material to class to inform our discussions (i.e. Videos) ",
            "\u00a0The professors and their high engagement with the students and the material helped shape the course very much, but it was the students who truly made the class what it was. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting and informative. However, I did not get as much out of the structure of the course as I could have. It would have been helpful to break up the class discussion structure to allow more time to hear from the professor and TA, or into other formats that would have been helped to facilitate engagement. It seemed like the discussions were at times disjointed and I did not get as much out of them as I could have. It would have been helpful to have slightly less readings and allow more time to read each one thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very good opportunity to discuss ideas with the instructors and the classmates, but perhaps it would help to have more structure in the discussions, or to have an idea of the topics that the instructors would like to touch during the sessions. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding energy from an anthropological perspective. This course compels you to embed technical systems in larger social contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if it's being offered again! This course is crucial. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A lot of reading, and the professors expect a lot, but they support you along the way. I feel like I gained so much new insight on energy, and am walking away from this course with a radically new, indefinitely more nuanced perspective on energy structures. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely I would recommend! I don't know if it will be taught again, but if it is, I think soooooo many people would benefit from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in energy and its relationship with power. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it would open your eyes to other ways of thinking about energy that are useful but seldom mentioned in mainstream writings on the subject "
