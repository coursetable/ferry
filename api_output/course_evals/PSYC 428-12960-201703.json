            "\u00a0This class allowed me to learn more about certain aspects of decision-making and understand how to think critically concerning neuroscience evidence surrounding the topic. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a neat opportunity to develop my understanding of neuroscience specifically related to judgment and decision-making processes. The course was well-laid out to facilitate learning -- we started off with a bit Bayesian and machine learning, and as the course developed, we learned how different parts of the brain implicated in decision-making operate using these and other algorithms. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent exploration of the field of neuroscience of decision-making, from topics such as neuromarketing, to Altruism. This course covered it all. Great discussions and learned a lot about how to turn questions about how humans choose into studies, and the difference between laboratory settings and real world applications for decision making tasks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about neuroscience, good psychological and neuroscientific practices, and also was exposed to some really cool research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the neural bases of a lot of elements of decision making. The foundation I had from Human Brain was really useful when I was just going through the papers. I also became way more fluent with reading neuroscience papers in general. The discussion design of the class allowed me to learn and ask relevant questions that were crucial to the class discussion. ",

        [
            "\u00a0I think the class had excellent discussions, although I think the class would benefit from a little more overlap of critical readings and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was great in bringing together information from other neuroscience courses to better understand how this information is applicable and useful. \r\n\r\nOne limitation of the course is that it is not well suited for a seminar. At times it was difficult to fill the entire 2 hour seminar with discussion just based on the research papers we read. Also, some background in econ would definitely help in order to understand the methods and theories addressed in the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Crockett is like an encyclopedia. She contributed so much to the class by always knowing the relevant studies to answer different questions that were posed in class. Truly, I am in awe of her knowledge base. The class also enjoyed a high degree of participation from all of the students, probably because everyone in the class had at least a decent foundation in neuroscience, which was nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times the seminar discussions felt a bit off-the-wall, pop-psychology-y, and divorced from the heavy neuroscience readings that we prepared for class. However, this may just be a nature of this kind of course: it's not THAT fun to discuss the nitty-gritty of different neural structures, and it's hard to generate any kind of controversial discussions to have around them. Nevertheless, so many of our discussions felt weirdly speculative and not rooted in science. ",
            "\u00a0Super cool readings, and good in class discussions. Not much improvement needed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Crockett is a genius in her field, and probably knows all the important papers about neuroscience of decision making there is. She really pushed us to think in a different way and pushed the conversation with every class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the discussion could be boring, so maybe the reading responses can be split into two parts so that students are more inclined to comment and reflect on the class afterwards.

            "\u00a0Professor Crockett was a joy to have in class - it was her first semester here from Cambridge, and her fresh perspective was a well needed addition to the department. A wonderful course with a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Awesome class regardless of major, as the learnings are very applicable to other subjects and disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this course, but probably only for a psych/cogsci/neuro major who already has a decent grasp on neuroscience and specifically wants to learn about decision neuroscience. The 5-6 papers that are assigned for reading on a weekly basis can be pretty dense, and I imagine would feel rather inscrutable to someone who hadn't taken Human Brain or an equivalent. If you want to just learn about behavioral economics, take an SOM course, not this course.\r\n\r\nThe workload of this course is very manageable. The 500-word weekly reading responses are an excellent motivation to stay on top of your readings, and the single ~10-page paper at the end is very manageable and Professor Crockett allowed a lot of flexibility re: topics and structures (research proposals, policy proposals, lit reviews...)\r\n\r\nMy only caveat with this course (though I truly believe this is going to be an intrinsic problem of neuroscience seminars, as opposed to lectures) is that it can be really hard to have an engaging class discussion about neural structures, so at times class discussions were a bit dead, and at other times they were really fun and wacky but not really connected to the readings at all.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a great class that is anchored by Professor Crockett and her INCREDIBLE knowledge base. Seriously, you could ask her about anything related to psych/neuroscience and she will tell you the relevant studies and the names of the professors studying the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, must take for those interested in social sciences, specifically Economics, Psychology, Neuroscience, Global Affairs, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fun, interesting, and compelling course. And it is useful to a variety of interests. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in a pretty chill but really interesting, still a little challenging class about neuroscience, this is it! I loved reading most of the papers because I learned so much about how we go about the decisions we make in every day life. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! "
