            "\u00a0Learned about the laws that govern atrocity crimes. All about the laws. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how global politics shape decisions surrounding atrocity prevention, as well as how the anti-atrocity regime has developed since WWII. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned about what constitutes mass atrocities (and particularly genocide), as well as its history of perpetration. Looking at cases that range from Rwanda to Bosnia to Indonesia, we've spent time not only examining why these terrible crimes happened, but also the global politics at hand that may have enabled or hindered its progression. Additionally, we looked at doctrines like R2P and how they can be enforced, as well as the process of reconciliation and peace-building post-mass atrocity. ",
            "\u00a0The politics of and surrounding genocide and other atrocities, and its international prevention regime. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the history and geopolitical struggle concerning genocides and mass atrocities after the holocaust, mostly in Africa, Europe and Asia. we also learned a lot about the UN and international bodies of law, including the ICC and past courts and conventions, including the ICTY and ICTR. I learned that the international community's failure to intervene in mass atrocities was often cause by more complicated geopolitics than laziness and lack of political will. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: really comprehensive analysis of mass atrocities across history and the laws that the UN and people have put in place to prevent/prosecute them\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading, the class discussion isn't interesting, and I don't care about laws because laws are oppressive ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome. The only strengths would be more activities in class- such as the midterm UNSC simulation that we did and the guest lecture where we answered different questions in groups. Thats when we were engaged the most. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Simon is great at leading seminar discussions, and the syllabus is well-structured. The material was all super interesting, and I really enjoyed the Security Council simulation. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I really enjoyed all the readings and the assessments. There were a variety of different assignments, from a short paper to a crisis simulation and policy brief, that really had you assess different ways of looking at the situation at hand. All the readings were interesting and clear, and helped provide a lot of background to the class discussion. Professor Simon also always did a great job at pushing discussion and bringing new perspectives to the table during the class. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is that I had wished the class was a bit longer so we can fit in all the discussions and had more engaging conversations with our guests ",
            "\u00a0there were A LOT of readings, but they were all pretty interesting (also very skimmable). Professor Simon is a great prof; he is very kind and encouraging in seminar and never demands answers to his questions. The content of the course was also one of its greatest strengths-- super interesting themes and topics each week! It is crazy how much i learned from this class that i hadn't known about before-- it is sad that there isnt more curriculum in high school and college about mass atrocity because it is so prevalent and horrible. one weakness is that because prof. simon never aggressively forced conversation, the students in the class often didnt respond and it made the conversation less interesting and engaging than it could have been- but this is probably more a reflection of the students being lazy and not doing the readings or being on their laptops on facebook in class.

            "\u00a0Sure! If you want to learn about the laws, go for it. I wasn't prepared for that. I wanted more about the literal genocides and how they came to pass. Maybe I messed up because I didn't really know what Global Affairs really were before taking this class, but yeah it's a good class and Simon knows what he's talking about so go for it. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it was very engaging and i learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you want to learn about genocide studies, or conflict at all- take this course! Professor Simon is amazing and he is probably the best person you could learn this topic from. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the course material. It's also material that is super important for every Yale student as a global citizen. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student--particularly if you are interested in understanding how global dynamics have played into the perpetration of mass atrocities (or its allowance). Professor Simon is incredibly knowledgeable about the material and the class is designed to have you look at the topic of discussion for the class a million different ways. Going in, my knowledge about mass atrocities was limited to a few events, but this class really broadened my perspective and instilled a grave sense of the need to preclude anything like this from happening again. ",
            "\u00a0I would  definitely recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning more about genocide and other forms of atrocities.  Professor Simon is very knowledgeable and very helpful in guiding the discussions in class as well as questions during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0i would recommend this course if you are interested in human rights, international politics, the UN, humanitarian intervention and anything else related!! prof simon is really nice and very passionate about the subject (he studies the rwandan genocide against the tutsis outside of class). the content is very interesting and will make you so much more aware of what is going on around in the world! I would recommend this especially if it is your first political science seminar! "
