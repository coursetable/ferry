            "\u00a0Learned how to relate texts to present day issues, developed writing skills ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the greatest thought processes and ideologies that have fundamentally defined the western human condition. I read a lot of amazing books as well as improved in the clarity of my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Read some of the greatest thinkers in modern historical/political thought. Was able to connect/synthesize theories to reality (current events, political happenings, etc). Learned to present own point of view and argument in political thought analysis essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned just what DS advertised: the ideas the form the foundation of historical and political thought in the modern, Western world. I am glad to have this knowledge, but wish that there was some way to incorporate student creativity into it. Sometimes it felt as if we were reading just to read, trying to get through the bulleted list of authors so that we can check them off our mental lists. The pace of DS can be very rewarding, but it can also sterilize ideas, stripping away the wonder inspired by a close communion with a text. Our examination of Marx in H&P serves as an example: the big question--in what ways is our capitalist economy exploitative, and does it necessarily have to be that way?--can get lost, as we needed to spend most of our time on Marx defining key terms and identifying the foundational claims. Professor Steinmetz Jenkins tried to incorporate both, especially by bringing in other thinkers on the subjects, but even still, there were quite a few times where I left class unsatisfied with the abstract, non-essential nature of our discussions. This could be a sacrifice I signed on to when I signed on to DS, but that doesn't make it less frustrating. "

            "\u00a0I would like to see more radical enligjtment thinkers. No more Hume pleasd ",
            "\u00a0The course is very ambitious in the wide variety of books that you read and very informative in detailing the western tradition. Sometimes the readings are a bit heavy, but if you think about it like a survey and a way to learn a little bit about a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great syllabus. \r\nWeakness: wish there was more connections to real-life real-time events, so we can see what these political theories look like in action. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn about some of the major thinkers behind the western society and some of the greatest political scientists of the West, as well as to someone wanting to read a lot of great books and perfect their writing all the while in a environment that promotes discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Every class was an opportunity to discuss and analyze in depth the readers we're studying. I came away from each section feeling like I've learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Some days, if you asked me, I would say I recommend DS. Other days, I wouldn't. I think of DS as a medium-term investment in my education, but it rarely brought me short-term pleasure. It wasn't the workload itself that frustrated me, but the nature of discussions: it's really hard to do meaningful work at such an incredible pace. I worry that I will not remember half the texts I read in a few years, because we engaged with them in such a cursory and quick way. (https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-curse-of-reading-and-forgetting) But it has been pretty cool to be able to understand some of the history of the ideas we throw around in the news everyday, from democracy to federalism to our obligations to one another. I see the value of DS, but I also see its flaws. I hope that, reflecting as a senior, I have more perspective on the program and am able to wholeheartedly recommend it. "
