            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. I've always been fairly unfamiliar with health policy, especially in the U.S., and I feel like I'm coming out of this class with so much more knowledge. Though the class was huge, it still felt engaging -- I credit that to Jason's lecturing style. The course was definitely very long -- 3-5:20pm is no joke. Even though being in lecture could get tiring, I was still motivated to attend and remain engaged. If this class could be offered at a different time, I think it would make a big difference. Overall, taking this class made me passionate about health policy issues in the U.S. (and I think it was a good time to take it, considering our recent political climate) and I never thought I'd ever think that way towards health policy. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting course that hits on points all Americans should know about their health care system. The lecture slides and Jason's lecture style are very approachable. The only limitation is the length of the class. A lot of material gets packed into those 2.5 hours which can be somewhat daunting and tiring. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very well done introductory course to health policy.  Jason covered a lot of material in a succinct and clear manner.  Given the size of the class he also did an exceptional job of allowing for discussion and engaging students within the lecture hall. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class for people who don't have any experience or knowledge of US health policy, like me. It's a lot of content (or maybe it feels like it because the classes are so long). The readings are extremely long and I feel like they only somewhat augment the lectures. But it was an extremely comprehensive course and I Learned a lot. I appreciated the attention given to current political issues and how they might impact health policy in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Bad format for this type of course. Would be much more useful to be able to discuss the issues.  Really terrible way of testing material.  Policy is not meant to be a memorize and regurgitate but rather discuss and dissect. ",
            "\u00a0great introduction to health policy, covers a wide array of topics, only complaint is the structure of having one longer class per week ",
            "\u00a0This was far and away the best course I took during my first semester at YSPH. After being disappointed with the caliber of several others, I was so pleased to have the opportunity to take this one. ",

            "\u00a0The course was interesting and I learned a great deal.  However, the once a week for 2.5 hours in a large lecture hall definitely took away from my experience.  I found it hard to concentrate and hard to have a discussion in class about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was the best of my first semester at YSPH. It was engaging, informative, and a really good overview of the history of US health policy. I felt as though I could engage and talk about topics that I typically avoided because they seemed too complex. I also feel more equipped to tackle policy issues and understand the complexities behind certain issues. ",

",
            "\u00a0I like this class, it is my favorite class this semester, because I learned so much! ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the relevance of the course to contemporary events in health policy. In addition, the readings were generally interesting and the lectures were very helpful. \r\n\r\nIn terms of examinations, I believe that they could be improved by focusing more on the theory and policy implications as opposed to focusing on the details such as terminology.\r\n\r\nFor a survey course, however, I think the structure was very helpful in terms of teaching the breadth of topic in health policy. ",
            "\u00a0A great introductory-level class with an amazing, dynamic professor\r\nWould be much better suited if it met twice a week for a shorter period of time--it was nearly impossible to sit through two and a half hours of lecture at a time, even with a small break in between ",
            "\u00a0I am not a policy person at all, but this course made me enjoy it more than I ever have. It was well-organized and I learned a lot. I really liked the \"In the News\" bits at the beginning of each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was too long. Having one lecture a week that is almost 2.5 hours long is too much. The lecture needed to be broken up and class needed to be held more than once a week. No one can focus for that long. ",
            "\u00a0I have taken multiple policies courses in the past and so it was frustrating that we were learning only the basics and were not really digging into the material more. It seems like this course was made to catch everyone up to speed. I think that the rigor of this course needs to be improved. This means digging into the material more and actually expecting us to \"unpack\" the concepts. \r\n\r\nI think that this course could be improved by having more one on one time with the TAs. I think that there should be a discussion period in this course like there is with Epi. ",
            "\u00a0A great course, but there were just too many students. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course- super interesting material and assignments, and very engaging instructor. A lot of assigned reading, however. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was a great overview of US health policy. Going into this course I didn't think I really was interested in this topic but after completing it, I feel like I can actually speak intelligently about many topics that are surrounding healthcare today and found that I actually quite enjoyed the material! My only suggestion would be for the final to be either a paper or a take home exam. While I like the idea of asking our opinions on various topics, I think since we were so crunched for time and we had to pull things from our memory, many of the essays will lack substance and simply be opinion papers. I think it would be more interesting for Jason to read if we could pull in some statistics or facts to supplement and support our opinions which would only be possible if we were given the freedom to use outside sources. I also think if the final were a paper, people would spend more time than 2.5 hours on them so you would get a better result than the short essays we had to write for the final. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this class!  As someone who is not in the health policy department, I was worried that the material was going to be very dry and something that did not interest me but I was happily surprised to learn that this was not the case at all.  The readings chosen were very easy to follow along and appreciate the magnitude of meaning in public health as a whole. Overall, this was one of my favorite classes this semester and I am sad to see it end. ",
            "\u00a0Good course that gave me a framework of understanding the US health system. ",
            "\u00a0This was a valuable introduction to the basic concepts of health policy, especially as someone who had almost no background knowledge in the subject.  I would have appreciated more material covered on global health systems, although the time devoted to this was adequate for what was in the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. It was great introduction to health policy and really helped me understand why the US health care system is the way it is. I have even schooled my (aging) parents on health insurance with the knowledge from this class. 10/10, would recommend taking this. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course! Great overview of health policy and engaging lectures. Assignments were interesting to complete and helped to solidify learning process. The midterm exams were fair but the final felt overwhelming--2.5 hours for 6 essays felt like pure chaos. ",
            "\u00a0It is an extremely detailed class that will help you understand the complexities of health policy in this country. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic- although it covered a broad range of topics, we were still able to learn about specific details of each and how they are all interconnected. I definitely feel like I have a much stronger understanding of health policy in the U.S and what practices in place may be hindering our progress towards improving the U.S health care system. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schwartz is one of the best professors I have ever had in my Yale College and Yale School of Public Health experience! His slides are clear and concise and he is able to explain complex health policy terms in digestible ways. The short writing assignments were thought-provoking and the midterm exams were fair. The final exam was an interesting opportunity to voice my opinions concerning often controversial health policy debates. I learned so much from the course and can confidently say I feel more comfortable navigating the complex health policy world. This has been one of my favorite courses this semester and I feel every YSPH student should take the course! ",
            "\u00a0Gives you more than enough information about an introduction into health policy ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covered a lot of different policy topics which provided a very nice overview of health policy, evaluated through both writing and tests\r\nWeaknesses: A big class size\r\nImprovement: It would be nice to have more discussion but it is understandable why this doesn't happen (because of the large class size) ",
            "\u00a0too much assigned reading each week!\r\nthe course (tests and exams) is too hard for non-American students!\r\nnon native english speakers don't have enough time to write the answers for the tests and exams! ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Coming from a non-government/policy background, I learned so much in such a short period of time. Class is long - might have been nice to have twice a week for less time than once a week. The first writing assignment was confusing so early without really understanding that much about health policy. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: The number of required readings was unrealistic.  Many students in the class are not policy students and do not have a specific interest in policy that would drive them to do the readings out of pure interest.  I feel as though Dr. Schwartz knows that we cannot get to all the readings, as he does summarize them in class.  Many students were very stressed by the workload at the beginning of the semester, so you have to realize that you will be fine if you cannot complete every reading.  Dr. Schwartz emphasizes what you need to know in class.  I'm sure the readings are useful, but too many are assigned.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dr. Schwartz is a great professor.  I expected this course to be my least favorite as it is outside of my field, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes.  Dr. Schwartz is an amazing lecturer, providing lots of information while keeping students engaged and interested.  He is very energetic and knowledgeable.  I was worried about having a long policy lecture, but I was always engaged.\r\n\r\nMaterial was presented clearly in slides, and Dr. Schwartz provided lots of important additional information.  Good note taking is important in this course.  There were few words on each slide, but they were well explained in lecture. Dr. Schwartz posted recordings of his lectures on Canvas, which were useful if you missed any information in class while taking notes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Subject material was interesting and useful to learn for the future\r\n-despite the long hours, the instructor was engaging and made learning the material more feasible \r\n-I enjoyed the overview of current events related to health policy and the US healthcare system\r\n-tests felt fair and tested subject material as expected \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Very long lecture, it was difficult to sustain attention for almost 3 hours ",
            "\u00a0very helpful for fundamental knowledgement of health policy in the U.S ",
            "\u00a0The course content encompasses the foundations of health policy and healthy system, and all hot issues regarding the controversy toward health policy. I like the way Professor give the lecture. The news section and topic section are both very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The coursework is very smartly designed and does a good job of giving an introduction to the health policy issues in the US. ",
            "\u00a0one of my favorite classes this semester! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class! I learned so much about insurance and health policy, and everything we talked about was extremely relevant to what's going on in the world right now. I can't imagine anyone going through an MPH program without this kind of comprehensive coverage of the US health system. \r\nI liked how the work was distributed -- I never felt like I was overwhelmed but the workload was always steady. The papers were interesting to write and the tests seemed generally fair. However, sometimes the test questions seemed to focus on such subtle details that I didn't have the chance to show my overall understanding of the concepts. For example, on the second test there was a short answer question about the history of China's health system, which was literally only mentioned in a single bullet point on a single slide. I definitely appreciate that we have options on every test but that just seemed like such a minor point given the vast amount of information we were being tested on. \r\nOverall, this is a great class and probably the MPH class that I've learned the most from so far. ",
            "\u00a0strength: very meticulous introduction of health policy and health system from different perspectives.\r\nweakness: i hope there could be TF hour every other week to help us to link different topics and establish a broad picture of health policy. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING course. the content was amazing and thoughtfully put together. by far my favorite course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0It is very good at explaining the basics of the health policy structure to someone who is very new to the field and then building upon it. The teaching style is great. It may be helpful to have discussion sections/ways to get to know our TFs better/synthesize the material better in small settings. While that was available for HP students, it may also be beneficial to non concentrators. ",

There's definitely a mountain of information we go over every week, and so it can feel overwhelming sometimes, but this course is pretty crucial for anyone interested in the U.S. Health Care system. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvements, it would be nice to have discussion sessions for non-HP students to dissect the material outside of class.

They are a perfect balance of current events, screen shots of articles, class engagement questions, images, graphs, etc. His enthusiasm always shows, and it elevates the class to a higher level overall. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a good overview of US health systems and policy. The instructor was very engaging and a good lecturer. I feel I learned a lot from the course.

Professor was engaging with students and made the time fly. Great selection of course material and reading. Only weakness: would prefer more instruction on what we will be tested on. Often found the material too overwhelming to memorize it all and the tests often would have very specific answers that seemed almost like randomly chosen. Would prefer exams that tested us more like the last exam or the papers: proving we understand the overall concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Big fan of the course. I'm not really able to be particularly useful as I really liked the course and so can't offer much in the way of advice. I do have weird complaint, which is that I feel like Prof Schwartz was at times too apologetic for his tests- it might just be his propitiating/conciliatory demeanour but I thought they were perfect and work well in the overall structure. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course. Evaluations are good and make sense, your asked to know specific info throughout the semester, and then be able to defend broad arguments in the final. Came out of it with a much clearer knowledge of the healthcare system. Maybe an improvement would be to split each class into two days a week, it could get tedious being in there for 21/2 hours. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was the only large lecture course I had this semester that incorporated interaction/engagement from the professor and students. It was a really fascinating overview course with clearly defined assignments and exams. The only weakness I viewed was the short writing assignments - either they could have been longer word counts or less research-oriented as it was difficult to incorporate everything asked for in the short word count. ",

            "\u00a0Awesome class. I had no previous knowledge of health policy and this class opened my eyes. Very fair assessments. My best class this semester and health policy is not even my concentration. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The instructor (see response to that question).\r\n-- The PowerPoints were well-organized and thorough, with timely topics.\r\n-- The in-class student polls were engaging, and a good way to participate in the lecture while staying anonymous for potentially contentious questions.\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- There was a lot of reading, with little accountability. I would have liked maybe 5 minutes each class to discuss 1 reading that had been marked in advance for peer discussion in small groups. That would ensure that students keep up and engage with the reading. The Tuesday meetings did some of this, but were not enough on their own to serve that purpose; and the class periods, being very long, would have benefited from being broken up into more types of activities besides lecture.\r\n-- Similarly, after administering a poll, each student could then turn to the person next to them and discuss the issue. ",

The written assignments, too, were, I felt, useful; I would have appreciated more.\r\n\r\nI was, however, not a fan of the final. I did not find writing off the cuff, op-ed-style essays to be a great way of synthesizing the course's wide range of material. I, personally, would have preferred to have another, timed writing assignment. That's all personal preference, however. ",

His slides and readings are up to date, his passion for the material is evident. The exams and assignments are not very interesting (the final blue book exam felt especially dumb) but reasonable. Overall, an adequate introduction to health policy which would be better served by a smaller enrollment but in the end gets the job done. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great itself in helping us gain an overall understanding of health policy and health system. However, the class is lasted for half and 2 hours, which is too long to focus for the whole time. and the professor spoke a little bit fast. ",

There was so much I realize now I didn't know about health policy and it's rewarding to be able to speak about it (somewhat) intelligently and knowledgeably. However, my one qualm with this class (and I say this as someone who identifies as liberal): I don't think both sides of the equation are often discussed. There's a heavy left leaning bias in terms of policy in this course. The ACA is almost always spoken of quite favorably. I think this is a general issue for most Yale courses of course, but I will say I think it gives you less of the full picture. Especially when I went to speak about certain aspects of the ACA with people outside of Yale, I realized I knew little about its shortcomings and thus couldn't speak much on these issues. The course would benefit from a more neutral approach to policy. ",

I think going forward, maybe testing the class with a short quiz every couple weeks to keep us up to speed before midterms would be great and would force us to stay on top of the material. I found myself somewhat cramming for his exams. ",

            "\u00a0I loved this class! Jason Schwartz makes his lectures engaging, interactive, and relevant with current news. I really enjoyed the current news slides Jason would present at the start of every class and his receptiveness towards questions students had. The class is very long and at an inconvenient time, but it was one I never dreaded going to. \r\n\r\nStrengths- Jason's presentations were always up to date with current events and news. He did an excellent job tying textbook material with current events, which is so important for students to stay relevant in the healthcare space. I loved that Jason took polls on contentious issues throughout the class and considered both sides of an argument- which is very lacking at YSPH. He encouraged us to think about the conservative perspective and the complex rationale both political parties have in healthcare issues. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- As painful as the final exam was, I think it provoked thoughtful discussions about larger healthcare issues. One suggestion is to turn the final into a paper rather than an in-class exam. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class! The lectures were fun and interesting to listen to. I feel like I learned a lot, and for a class that is required, this one felt very worth it. It was definitely large, but Jason always engaged with the audience, making it feel smaller. I think the polls/survey questions were a great addition. ",

One of the major strengths of this course is the breadth of the material it covers. I now have at least a basic knowledge of the main aspects of health policy and health systems, particularly in the United States. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement is regarding the midterm exams. Some of the questions on the midterm exam, such as the fill in the blank or the ones that ask to write down terms, seemed random. The format of the final exam was great! It did a good job of testing students' knowledge of the major themes of the course and the important issues involved in the establishment and evolution of health systems. The midterms would be even more effective if they were more mostly essay based like the final exam. Overall, I learned a lot from the course! ",

I learned a significant amount from the class and appreciated the thought put into the structure and material covered in class. The exams were fair based on the material covered in class and really liked the format of the final exam as more of an expressive and comprehensive explanation of understanding rather than sheer memorization.

It seems like the type of course that should also have a discussion section rather than purely a large lecture-based format. Exams were very detail oriented and while mostly \"fair\" sometimes focused in on very narrow and specific topics that were not emphasized in class. ",
