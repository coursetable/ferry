            "\u00a0This is a great course for laboratory techniques! My molecular biology wet lab skills have vastly improved. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to do PCR, gel electrophoresis, gel purification, plasmid insert ligation and bacterial transformation, spectrophotometry, bacterial colony analysis, CRISPR!!! ",

            "\u00a0I learned the basics of molecular biology lab work, such as pipetting, dilutions, PCR, and how to keep an organized freezer box. I also learned how to keep a proper lab notebook and how to plan and write up protocols. ",
            "\u00a0From this course, I learned basic laboratory techniques such as PCR and molecular cloning. I also learned how to interpret my findings and turn them into a scientific report. "

            "\u00a0in the beginning it could be harder to understand where all the experiments are headed. a better introduction might have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0The class had great flow to it and the instructors did a great job explaining each step really well. When some fell behind, the teachers did a great job making sure everyone knew what they were doing and no one felt left behind. The only downside is there is only a few pieces of real data obtained. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent for exposure to techniques, though it was not well-organized. Students often did not know what was going to happen each section until a few hours before, when homework assignments were published on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course is very scattered. Moreno is a great instructor and is always willing to help, however this often causes gaps in knowledge between students since not everyone receives the same level of guidance or information. I understand that everyone is at different parts in their experiment in any given week, but I think it would be beneficial to add a common lecture component at the beginning of each lab. Moreno often structures it as a discussion when she does, so I believe this is possible while retaining the component of development critical thinking as opposed to just giving us the procedure to do. Another thing is that feedback is very sparse. The TAs take a long time to give feedback and its not very constructive when they do. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness was that I was confused for several weeks about what we were actually doing. Sit down with the kids very early on and discuss what each of the steps in the project are, not just the overview. One strength was that despite having a lot to complete in the allotted time, we always finished or caught up to where we were supposed to be because we had a determined professor who wanted to make sure we succeeded. Another weakness is that the TA's didn't provide sound feedback to help your final report. After turning in the final report, I was marked off on several things that I had present in drafts but they did not correct me in the drafts. What is the point of drafts if they don't help you fix the mistakes? ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is the application of the skills learned in this class to real laboratories. Another strength is the ability to contribute to a real study being conducted at Yale. One weakness is the lack of specificity in the preparation for each week's lab. Another weakness is if you fall behind one week, you play catch up for the rest of the semester. An improvement could be more clarity when assigning protocols for the week. "

            "\u00a0Useful techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great bio lab course. only one large lab report which ins't too bad because you get feedback on drafts so the work is very doable. no weekly graded assignments is nice. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. Dr. Moreno is awesome and such a great professor. The project we worked on throughout the course of the semester was actually super interesting, since we got to use CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the genome of tomato plants. The workload was really manageable and not bad for a lab class. Overall it was a great lab to take. Plus it is half of a writing credit, so in combination with Model Organisms lab, a great way to fulfill a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great if you want to learn wet lab techniques, but if you're already comfortable with the techniques covered in class, it's probably not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for a fairly chill bio lab class to take and learn some fun biology techniques. Professor Moreno is a wonderful person who cares about her students and asks them how they are doing and what they are doing over the summer. Both TAs are also extremely helpful and very patient. Weekly assignments mostly consisted of writing up a protocol (which was not usually not collected) for the experiment to be done - this was fairly useful for preparing for the day in lab. Writing assignments were crammed in over a few stressful weeks but most weeks there was not that much work outside of class - though class time did take a long time. Be prepared to stay until 5 or 5:30 pm. Some days it was pretty fun because there was stuff to do but there was also a lot of waiting around for things to incubate and centrifuges to spin - I brought other work when I got bored. Also you should enjoy micropipetting because that's mostly what the lab days will consist of. It was also cool to being working on a larger project/goal and to use CRISPR! ",
            "\u00a0This is a good biology laboratory to take. It teaches you the basics of lab work and would be useful to take before you even start research in a lab. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a friend. The class teaches valuable molecular biology skills used frequently in labs. The class also teaches the students how to write a scientific paper properly. Professor Moreno is such a kind soul that is dedicated to making sure everyone understands what they are doing and will not hesitate to help a student after class. Although this class may be more strenuous than other MCDB labs, I feel that the skills learned and Professor Moreno's guidance make up for it. (Plus, this is definitely the class if you're looking for a science-y writing credit.) "
