            "\u00a0This class is one that I felt I learned the most from during my time at Yale. The speakers that Dean and David brought in were incredibly engaging and strong at presenting their investment strategies. I learned so much about different asset class characteristics and what endowment managers must analyze when putting together an investment portfolio. ",
            "\u00a0You'll get an understanding of how an endowment selects its investors. But in the process you meet investors who operate in many different asset classes, which helps you understand what differentiates great managers from average ones. Also you get to learn from Dean and David, which is literally unreal -- they are probably the smartest, most down-to-earth people in the business. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of investment topics. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent class that provides insight into investment styles within particular asset classes (such as venture capital, real estate, domestic equity, etc.) as well as the overall portfolio management process. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I learned a great deal about investment principles of the industry's foremost investors ranging from management techniques and ideation. We learned about a variety of different asset classes through the presentations of guest lecturers as well as class presentations/discussions and lectures given by David and Dean about the YIO and Yale's endowment principles. ",
            "\u00a0Coming in with relatively little knowledge regarding investments, asset allocations and the difference asset classes (let alone institutional investment at all), this was a fascinating and captivating course and I'm so proud of just how much I was able to learn - not in any sort of traditional learning styles, but mostly through deeply listening to Dave and Dean's stories and experiences and the guest speakers' as well. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be at the same table of two of Yale's true rockstars (for good reason), some guests who are just as impressive and interesting, and 20 of Yale's brightest and most eager minds in the class.\r\n\r\nOne of the best learning experiences I've ever had, and really increased my interest in the topic tenfold. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible course that not only provided an extensive introduction to different asset classes, but also gave great insights into investing. I learned a lot about portfolio management as an institutional investor, asset allocation, and the theory and practice behing attractive returns and risk management. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a thorough introduction to investment, primarily in the context of endowment management. The course also explored the fundamentals of equities, real estate, and venture capital. The guests speakers for the course were some of the most successful investors in the world and it was a pleasure to learn about their experiences. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I genuinely looked forward to all the classes that had guest speakers come in to discuss their experiences and investment strategies. The workload was challenging, with written assignments due after every presentation, but also helped in synthesizing the key takeaways from every class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely brilliant, I really cannot think of any weaknesses. The strengths were many, but not limited to: two of the best professors I've had, brilliant guest speakers, a great TA for the class, engaging classroom discussions, ethics presentations and other presentations. A great seminar! ",
            "\u00a0Great course generally. ",
            "\u00a0This class has very few weaknesses, and the only one that might be worth considering is earlier communication on timing/expectations for assignments. This was my favorite class at yale however, so not much to complain about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the plethora and the caliber of guest speakers, David and Dean's approachability and accessibility, engagement with the course through interesting case studies, readings, and presentations, encouragement of students to have an opinion and speak up in class ",
            "\u00a0The course is full of strengths. It would be nice to have gotten assignments back quicker because I wasn't able to adequately critically reflect on my previous writing before jumping into the next assignment. I would maintain the structure of this course into the future, though. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was incredible and the guest lectures were very exciting. The material was advanced, and even somebody who possessed a finance background, I oftentimes had a difficult time grasping some concepts and catching up, which taught me a lot. I also learned a lot of writing skills and how to convey ideas concisely. The course could be made stronger if Professor Takahaski and Professor Swensen had more direct interactions and evaluations of our short essays. I had a difficult time understanding my performance in the course as I couldnt receive feedback from them, but only from our TA Jon-Jon. Everybody was very supportive and it was always very exciting to come to class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is exceptional. The only weakness is that it is limited to the length of the semester. If you get a chance to take it, you must. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The readings and written assignments are time-intensive, but I found the class very rewarding in the amount I was able to learn overall. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0100%. Please, if you get in, don't even think twice about it, just take it. Whether or not you want to go into finance or become an investor, this class is a unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn from people who truly invented the field of endowment management and who've continued to be at the cutting edge of their business. Dean and David are unparalleled in their willingness to mentor students, their ability to teach, their love for Yale, and their magnificent track record for the endowment. Take it (and if you're reading this in the spring semester, apply!!) ",
            "\u00a0Its Swenson and Takahashi....of course you should take this course. Be warned, don't even try to show up to the first class unless you got in at the end of junior year. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you get in, you must take it. It really is an incredible opportunity to learn about all aspects of investment management. The guest speakers that come in are also very engaging and provide an honest take on their respective investment spheres. ",
            "\u00a0Best class I've taken at Yale. The David and Dean as well as the guest speakers they brought in were incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was by far my favorite course in my four years at Yale. The guest speakers, the dynamic of David and Dean and the level of engagement you get from this class is unparalleled. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend it, if you have the opportunity to get a spot. I was impressed with how much I was able to learn - not through any sort of traditional learning styles, but mostly through deeply listening to Dave and Dean's stories and experiences, and the guest speakers' as well. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be at the same table of two of Yale's true rockstars (for good reason), some guests who are just as impressive and interesting, and 20 of Yale's brightest and most eager minds in the class.\r\n\r\nExpect a relatively high workload, with five short papers (reacting to guest speakers or reading/investment topics) that are pretty closely scrutinized, followed by a final paper on a topic of your choice. And seminar participation.\r\n\r\nOne of the best learning experiences I've ever had, and really increased my interest in the topic tenfold. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Everyone is super engaged and you learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you can get in. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity with veterans from the investing world. The guest investment managers are incredibly inspiring,  and they are people that you really would not get to meet otherwise. The course is high workload, and the short essays take much longer than you think. The class taught me an incredible amount about different asset classes, including venture capital, domestic equity, real estate and absolute return. You also learn an immense amount from your classmates and class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Best course I've taken at Yale. David and Dean are brilliant, and the guest speakers are some of the most talented investors in the world. You will learn an immense amount in this course and it will change the way you think about the world. If you get the chance, take this course. "
