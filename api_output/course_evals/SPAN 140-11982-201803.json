            "\u00a0I improved my speaking, reading, writing, and listening comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about subtle grammar hints that I would never have learned before. Also, I learned a lot about what it means to immerse oneself in the language they are learning.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Spanish language, I also learned a lot about Mexican culture, as well as some good Spanish short movies and long films. I also learned a lot about Gael Garcia Bernal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Advanced grammar.\r\nVocabulary.\r\nConfidence speaking without notes.\r\nIncreased knowledge of history of the Spanish-speaking world. \r\nWriting, debate, and reading experience. ",
            "\u00a0improved command of the past tenses and narrative tenses in Spanish; improved vocabulary; further exposure to Spanish language media and literature ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Spanish in the context of culture and views of the Hispanic world. It was a first taste at having to coordinate with other students at Yale, let alone students in other grades. ",
            "\u00a0This class is designed to enhance reading and writing abilities in Spanish.  There was less focus on listening comprehension and even less on speaking.  I also developed insights into Latin American politics in the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very grammar intensive. I feel my spanish developed a lot in vocabulary and fluency. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my grasp on written and spoken Spanish. I also was exposed to literature and cinema in Spanish. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The material is very interesting, and the activities are fun and engaging. I learned a lot, especially by watching the movies assigned in class. \"No\" was my favorite part of the year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It meets every day, and I do not consider myself to be fluent in Spanish after taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course that offers really intensive Spanish grammar, and also provides ample opportunity to practice speaking and reading. ",
            "\u00a0I hate that it meets everyday. It just makes the class so unenjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMaria Carolina Baffi.\r\nGrammar was excellent \r\nThe workbook and our use of it was extremely good. Well organized and useful for the course and discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nVHL assignments are too easy for L4 Spanish. We're past the point where they're in any way useful. The hard part at this point is not following the rules but rather practicing their application, and Vistas really isn't that good at that. \r\nAlso, that I had to pay for the textbook when we only used it for about 4 chapters is ridiculous. It's not in any way the good part of the class, so we should just use the workbook. ",

            "\u00a0The course certainly felt rushed. Even though it met everyday, it seemed like there was so much content that we barely finished everything in the time allotted. It was useful knowledge that geared us towards mastery of the language, but still a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I believe there should be less emphasis put on obscure vocabulary units and more emphasis on learning the complex verbs that are applied in the readings.  I could not read any of the stories without extensive help from a translator. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was great except the grammar would be very briefly taught in class. Could be improved if lessons were taught a bit longer. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the variety of activities that we did throughout the semester and the variety of literature we worked with. However, I wish that the semester was less packed. Revising the syllabus to include less passages and assignments would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely demanding and the course syllabus is outlined to have the students check multiple portals for their homework each night. It becomes very overwhelming at times, especially with so much at homework expected along with studying for assessments at the end of every week. "

            "\u00a0Yes. L4 seemed like the best level of Spanish class to take, according to what I have heard from my friends. I met some really good friends in that class, and I am very glad I took it. I would only encourage people not to take it if they don't want to meet every day. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I think my Spanish abilities improved tenfold, and it was always fun to come to class. ",
