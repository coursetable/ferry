            "\u00a0more info on communism, because i never really had much exposure to it in previous classes \r\njust a lot about Chinese history which I really appreciate \r\ndistilling the important subjects from a reading \r\ntyping faster because .... . .. you honestly lecture so quicky, Denise ho. omg ",
            "\u00a0Good foundation in Chinese history ",
            "\u00a0Really good class ",
            "\u00a0Got a pretty comprehensive view of modern Chinese history through different lenses from education to religion. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course of modern Chinese history, and I have a good, if still fairly cursory, understanding of movements and politics in China since Mao. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great survey course of Chinese history over the past 70 years. I liked that Professor Ho placed a particular emphasis on primary source material, which really added to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how China has developed since Mao's victory in the Chinese Civil War. The class was highly engaging and enthusiastically taught, and I greatly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount of information about China. I'm not sure I really developed as a writer, but I definitely learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0More info on Chinese history, which I had no exposure to beforehand \r\nparticipation in what feels like a high pressure setting [weekly section on Wednesdays :-) ]\r\nMore confidence in writing history research papers "

            "\u00a0VERRY speedy lectures--please slow it down\r\nKind of felt like a lot was expected of me, even though I had almost no exposure to this kind of history. Nick graded really harshly. ... . . . and I think this is a large factor. In part, it helped me grow + the difficulty of this course was rewarding. In other aspects, I felt like what you both expected was a little ridiculous. \r\nI liked Nick's lecture--I think it was more engaging sylistically--way more narrative based which made it easier to follow. \r\nI think switching back from Mao to now made understanding the chronology of events pretty confusing before a test. It's a cool format in theory but in practice it's kind of messy . ",
            "\u00a0Good material, but sections should be more interwctive ",
            "\u00a0This course can be most improved by teaching linearly. While the theme of Mao to Now is appreciated, the lumping of everything post Mao into one era is not only difficult to comprehend, but not conducive to really learning the history. Furthermore, Professor Ho's reading from a manuscript for lecture was too fast and left little clarity on how to navigate critical knowledge from her personal asides. While the course's strength is it's thematic frame, it has a lot left to be desired as far as tangible ways to discuss the theme itself in a logical way. ",
            "\u00a0I did not like the fact that this course was entirely thematic, jumping across two periods. Themes work well when applied to a specific period, but I found it difficult to gain a command of the timeline and figures involved when the material was taught in this non-chronological fashion. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it makes no sense to have a course that meets for 70 minutes twice a week (during which the instructor still solicits student comments and engagement) as well as a discussion section. This course would be better served being taught as a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think more use of media, in terms of videos, songs, etc. could be assigned for homework rather than readings. Media was used well in class and added a lot. I also wish we could have discussed contemporary issues in more depth. The class felt more Mao and less now. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the 'leminar' feel of this course and the emphasis that professor Ho placed on student participation. Lectures were always very well prepared and filled with interesting content, although at times it was hard to write everything down!\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think could be improved is the percentage grade breakdowns. I think 50% exams is a little too much for a history course, and we perhaps could have done a bigger research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really fascinating topics, well-led sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Ho's lecture style could be improved, readings could sometimes be a little dry ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nknew what to expect literally every single time I walked into the Hall of Graduate Studies \r\nmaterial required really close reading. Everything--lecture, section, homework assignments, etc--was really consistent. You could for sure get the hang of it after a while. This course was difficult for me, and I don't know if, knowing that, I would've taken it. Regardless, I feel better equipped to approach Yale's other East Asian history courses. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nLectures at lightning speed [I learned how to type faster at the very least!]\r\nknew what to expect literally every single time I walked into the Hall of Graduate Studies \r\nSwitching back from Mao era and now. . .. .. .really ISN'T conducive to gaining an understanding of the chronology of these events and themes. Somewhat interesting idea in theory but messy in practice : - / "

            "\u00a0Only if lectures are trimmed down/delivered more slowly, I MIGHT recommend this course.. .. . ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to learn Chinese history for the first time ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would take this course Cr/D if anyone was interested. While the history is interesting, the teaching style is not for everyone. As compared to other introductory history courses, this one demands much more work to memorize and learn key passages for IDs on tests. While I am unsure if it was just our TF who had high expectations from us in this history course, overall I would not recommend this course as a fifth nor a fourth unless you really have time to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0This was a solid survey course in modern Chinese history with a great, accessible professor, and an experienced TF. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a better cultural understanding of China and why it is how it is today. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think this is the best introductory course on China at Yale. Essential for the 21st century. ",
            "\u00a0I would, for anyone who wanted to learn more about China's recent history.  I went into the class with very little knowledge on the subject and feel that I have a much greater appreciation of the historical development of the PRC afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to take a course on China, I would recommend it with hesitations. You will definitely learn a lot - sometimes, it feels, a little too much - but it's all important to know. Prof. Ho's lecturing style can be choppy and not coherent, and I often found it difficult to take notes because of that. There were moments when I was studying for midterms/finals that I realized I only had a bullet point or two for keywords, just because they hadn't been fully explained in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in China and want to kind of be treated like a grad student in an undergraduate course, I would definitely recommend this class! "
