            "\u00a0Furthered ability to use MatLab. Advanced thought process involving Physics problems. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about rotational, vibrational, and gravitational motion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of math and physics, but this didn't feel like in an engineering classes in that the problems were rarely applied to actual realistic problems. The information may end up being useful, but the context for why wasn't clear during the class. Beyond what I learned, this class was really bad. The professor many of the lectures, and the TA was a poor lecturer. Problem sets were heavy on algebra and short on meaningful content. Overall, a very poor course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some more advanced topics from mechanics with vector and tensor calculus. ",
            "\u00a0The course is obviously on dynamics (e.g anything that is moving). Overall, I feel I primarily developed math and programming skills. The coding assignments are a little unrelated to the other content but will be useful in life. Most of the questions are fairly idealized as opposed to real world, but they teach useful advanced physics and math skills. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe some dynamics. Not too much ",
            "\u00a0Mostly expanded on physics knowledge that was previously learned in PHYS 200. Learned how to tackle more complicated problems and you use MATLAB. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty boring, just an extension of high school physics. A LOT of math. ",
            "\u00a0AP physics will get me far in life. ",

            "\u00a0I gained some insight into engineering dynamics and rigid-body motion but more than anything I developed an understanding of engineering notations.  I also gained some knowledge of tensors and particle dynamics. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Badly organized, boring lectures, no feedback or care about students' learning progress. The professor was gone for the entire first half of the semester, leaving the lectures to his TA, who is a good guy but gives lackluster lectures and is not good at explaining things. \r\n\r\nStrengths? ",
            "\u00a0A computing class was not a prerequisite for the classes but literally every pset we had to code. Was not optimal for learning as the tests were not coding. Would have loved the psets to be more like the tests so we knew what to expect/could get some practice with example problems on paper. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the problem sets had more analytical questions and less coding questions. I haven't taken a coding class so I essentially had to teach myself how to use Matlab, which was very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a bit dry. About a third of the material covered must be solved using Matlab and is not tested. Otherwise basic physics knowledge is sufficient to understand the course. Topics are fairly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0There are few strengths to this course. Weaknesses included poor contextualization for how the content covered could be applied to solving real engineering problems and an emphasis on algebra and derivations that could be looked up. ",
            "\u00a0Our professor was not there for 8 classes and Peter our TF, while very smart and kind, had to teach us for 6 with the other 2 not occurring at all. That being said Corey and Peter wants everyone to do well. ",
            "\u00a0This course went terribly. The lessons almost seemed random. The Professor was absent for weeks which is completely unacceptable. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was well done and the content provided a good amount of rigor that I think improved my engineering abilities. I would recommend spacing out the PSets a little more and ensuring the lectures are taught at a slightly slower speed since the concepts can be very confusing at times. ",
            "\u00a0Way too much algebra. Skip some from time to time ",
            "\u00a0The course is not well structured. There was 3 PSETs for the first two months. Then 3 in the last month. The PSET material was mostly MATLAB and really did not prepare you for the tests. O'Hern is an engaging lecturer but also was often absent and didn't seem to have a clear vision for what this course is supposed to teach. ",
            "\u00a0The class was mostly taught by our TA and I don't think I came away from the class with an overall understanding of dynamics; it felt like a series of smaller topics and linear algebra taught together, but I wasn't ever sure how it all fit together. I liked that we had Matlab assignments, I think it reinforced the skill well. It would be improved if the professor had office hours or seemed more invested in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Corey does not care ",
            "\u00a0Many of the lectures were way too much just working line by line through math instead of emphasizing the important points.  I also felt the course was improperly focused.  Modal analysis is very important for most industry applications yet only received a week, while particle analysis is fairly niche yet received far more attention. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the material has the potential to be interesting. During one of the earlier lectures (given by the INCREDIBLE TA, Peter) we used Newtons Equations of motion in polar coordinates in order to derive the relationships that govern the eccentricity of a planets orbitthats objectively cool stuff. I also found moments of inertia to be quite interesting. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is the way that it is taught. The professor (who is also the DUS of Mechanical Engineering) was not committed to the course in any way. His TA taught the class. As much as I love Peter, it is not his job to lecture. Im sure he wasnt paid as much as he should be, given the work that he put into this class. \r\n\r\nCorey missed 8 of the lectures (6 were taught by Peter, 2 were canceled). This is unacceptable. If this class is going to continue to be required for the mechanical engineering major, it needs to be taught by someone who is dedicated to the task at hand. ",
            "\u00a0exams were really fair ",
            "\u00a0Oddly enough, the whole course felt a little bit like an introduction.  The material was interesting, but we never seemed to get into real applications or actual engineering problems using the techniques.  I enjoyed learning the fundamentals, but some higher level material would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0I never really understand the overarching goal of the course other than deepening understanding of individual topics. I also thought the first weeks were almost impossibly difficult, then it got too easy, and finally settled to a good level of difficulty. Overall though, the subject matter was interesting and much of it seemed useful. ",

            "\u00a0Not really unless they have too. I thought it was taught incredibly quickly and with minimal explanation. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty good course overall and Professor O'Hern is a good teacher and reasonable. The content is useful mathematically although not always that rooted in real-world engineering. Be prepared for relatively few HW assignments that are fairly complicated and involved if done right. Also, the exams were fairly difficult but the grading seemed fair. Peter, the TA, was amazing and always helpful. ",
