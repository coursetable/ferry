            "\u00a0It was a great advanced introduction to the literature on both N and Latin American history re: Indians and colonialism. I think the biggest thing was learning the different between historical approaches to the topic and other humanist or social science approaches, e.g., demography, theories of culture, thru political institutions, etc. I also got a sense of the potentials and barriers to bridging the two geographically defined historiographies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about indigenous nations in North America and Latin America. In particular, I came to understand the diverse set of relationships among indigenous peoples and various empires. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a broad overview of the historiography of North, Central, and South America. Furthermore, it contextualized several important movements within American studies, such as the development of indigenous studies. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful for 20th Century Americanists and Latin Americanists who were seeking to further their knowledge on their respective sub-fields. It exposed me to scholarship that I would not have read in my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think hemispherically about indigeneity. This course establishes a solid historiographic base that includes perspectives on North, Central, and South American histories. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought one of the strengths was the diversity of perspectives the team of faculty members brought to the conversations. But I also thought it was too much sometimes--too many different approaches took the seminars in unproductive dimensions. Also, while I appreciated the attempt to bring N American and Latin American scholarship into conversation, there were certain weeks when it was more skewed toward the lit that I'm less familiar with, that I felt like I had little to contribute. All in all, I'm not sure the team-taught dimension works. Maybe 2 rather than 3 discussants? ",
            "\u00a0Having three professors both provided for a wide array of knowledge but also made for a somewhat uncoordinated environment. By the middle of the semester, it was clear the professors had begun to talk to each other before class more. There was way too much reading assigned. Although I recognize as graduate students we should be expected to do a large amount of reading, there was an excessive amount. Moreover because the reading covered so many different countries and indigenous nations, it was hard to string them together so we often didnt get to many of the readings. I like the book review and book presentation assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course, that it offered such a wide variety of readings on different topics, is at the same time one of its greatest weaknesses because it sometimes felt as though there was not enough time to delve deeply into any particular geographic region or time period. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is taught by three outstading scholars in their respective fields. The classroom was very diverse and I enjoyed engaging with students from different disciplines. Professors also engaged with our ideas and provided good feedback on our assignments. Professor Echeverri was the most available professor and is very enthusiastic about mentoring students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because it was taught by three instructors, I felt it was not well organized. The professors seemes all confused when they discussed assignments. It also felt that Professor Echeverri was doing the majority of the administrative work in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were excellent and generated interesting topics of conversation. However, the conversations in class rarely included everyone, often because only a small fraction of the students felt comfortable speaking on the specific topic of the day. It would be beneficial to frame questions more hemispherically and thematically in order to engage the two halves of the room (US Americanists and Latin Americanists). "

            "\u00a0I would for sure, esp given that it's one of the only classes offered to grad students that includes this type of literature. But I'd say be ready for the seminar discussions to sometimes be either frustratingly narrow or frustratingly expansive. ",
            "\u00a0Depending on his or her interests in Latin America and the U.S. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Not only is the material interesting, but the professors are knowledgeable and eager to engage with student discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recomment it if it were taught by only one instructor. Having three professors made the workload exhausting and some instructions were not clear. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students seeking to learn about North and South American indigenous history, as the readings provide an important survey of both historiographies and the professors are the foremost experts in the field. "
