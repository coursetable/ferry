You get to explore a lot of these perspectives in class, which is pretty impactful. ",

We discussed the topics of happiness, religion, and morality in a way that allowed us to understand the current beliefs in philosophy, the studies done in paychology, and our own beliefs. I found the class to be extremely engaging and I learned so much not only on these topics but on my way of thinking. I feel like I not only gained a better understanding of human perspective but sharpened my own perspective. ",

Each lecture has readings that either connect to the lecture or will be discussed more in depth during the lecture, which is very helpful to facilitate a well-rounded understanding of the topic of the week.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections have the potential to be helpful, but that all depends on which TA you get and if you are having trouble with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the lecture in which Prof. Knobe clearly explained the content from the readings. For me the weakness of this course were the sections The weekly section felt inconsistent and could vary from a very engaging discussion to a boring clarification of the readings. ",

I wish we had applied some of the theories to more realistic scenarios or at least discussed them in different applications, but as a broad introduction it was a really good class. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the major strengths of the course is the list of readings and the content in general.  It's by nature very interesting. I also think that Prof. Knobe is incredibly astute and has an interesting way of presenting material. One of the weaknesses of this course would be a slight lack of direction when it came to the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Sections could be a little more structured around course material to enhance learning, rather than going off on tangential topics that are unrelated. ",

            "\u00a0The lecture hall itself was very dim and warm, making it easy to fall asleep in class. The professor is also very quiet during lecture, and the microphone broke multiple times during class, so being able to hear the lecture is a bit of a problem. This is a prominent issue in this class particularly because the lecture slides don't include much information, so a lot of the more important information is verbally communicated and hard to keep track of when you can't hear him speak. Maybe changing the lecture hall and keeping the technology up and running more consistently would help. If that's not possible, then including more notes on lecture slides would help too. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fascinating. The readings were relevant and written by the people who actually came up with the ideas, rather than by a second-hand textbook author. However, some things about the organization of the course were suboptimal. The structure of the material was sometimes hard to follow, as we followed down paths of arguments, counter arguments, counter-counter arguments, etc.. At points it got confusing, and in general it was difficult to study for in terms of the exams. Furthermore, my experience with my TA was not great and did not do a lot to advance my understanding of the material. Also, it was very difficult to get any feedback on my midterm or papers. The class had no firm system by which to return midterms to the students, even though the final was cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is Prof. Knobe and the way he organizes the course. He is an incredible lecturer, and made a 50 minute lecture go by really quickly. He is clear, and knows how to explain difficult concepts to students using stories/analogies. He also picked really intriguing topics for us to go through (e.g. happiness, belief in God). Another strength of this course is the structure of having two exams and two papers. I feel really bad for saying this, but I think the course could be improved by removing the TF-led lectures. The TF's in this class were for the most part amazing, but couldn't lecture as clearly/well as Prof. Knobe. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was structured really well. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGHTS: the material is all interesting. MOST of (but note, not all) of the readings are pretty short and you can handle them. I genuinely felt like I was learning about the human experience. I REALLY learned a new style of paper writing--specifically a philosophical paper. The cross-disciplinary structure with psychology was extremely interesting and gave the course some weight. WEAKNESSES: the reading was short BUT DENSE. Discussion sessions SUCK--really pointless but count toward grade, and your reading responses also count (even though they were pass fail). I know complaining about reading is dumb, but in this class you actually DO have to do all of the reading if you don't want to be screwed on the midterm and final. Oh yeah: there are two papers AND a midterm AND a final. It's a bit overkill. Especially since the papers took F O R E V E R to write. The philosophical nature of the papers made them these dense beasts that had to be written and re-written. Really a trial by fire with writing those. I pulled two or three all nighters in a row AFTER getting a head start, because one mishap early on with your logic can derail your whole paper and make you start again. Same thing with the reading, since it's super important for the midterms, you really CANNOT miss a single lecture. And when you do show up, be ready to listen and write. You'll read it in other reviews, but Professor Knobe--who is obviously extremely intelligent and a deep thinker--cannot speak up to save his life. Also the no computer policy sucks...but tbh no one followed that rule anyway. Nevertheless even without a computer and using a phone to record, I found myself lacking notes. Good luck trying to use the powerpoints. He specifically designs them so if you miss a lecture, they'll be meaningless pictures to you. BOTTOM LINE SORRY TLDR: If you're doing this because you genuinely love the material or wanna learn more about it, Great! That's what I did and it was rewarding, but buckle up THIS CLASS IS BY NO MEANS A GUT!!! Very tough, a lot of time, and a lot of thought. I took it as a first-year and it really took a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0I particularly enjoyed the readings and lectures for the course. I thought that the former covered significant breadth in striking a good balance between psychological studies and philosophical ones; even within these two categories, there was a good range of traditional publications and more modern works. However, I would have preferred it if the course went more in-depth into specific units (e.g. happiness, religion). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course was very well structured and the material was organized in a way that I understood the interconnection of the readings. I wish the lecture went into more detail and depth about each text. Most importantly though, I wish I received more help from my TA. My questions were rarely responded to (even when I explicitly stated them in reading responses) and there was not sufficient time to answer all questions in section. Also, I would have liked more guidance on papers because even though office hours with the professor were incredibly helpful, they weren't sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the material and Professor Knobe is a clear and engaging lecturer. I did wish that we had more time, even with section, to talk about the material or go more in depth since I felt a lot that I couldn't develop ideas without more conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I think the power points could include more notes to reflect back on during studies but otherwise it was an excellent course ",
            "\u00a0Professor Knobes lectures were very interesting and he used a lot of helpful analogies to simplify complex material, but it was impossible to hear him in class.\r\n\r\nAlso the timing of the last paper and final is a bit tight and it would be better if the second paper was due earlier. The final was also really hard. ",
            "\u00a0The structure is excellent, Professor Knobe is outstanding, and the material is super interesting. Nothing but positive things to say I enjoyed this class completely! ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job offering many different perspectives in an unbiased way. However, this strength is also the course's biggest weakness. Because the course covers so much material, Professor Knobe rarely goes into much detail on any one author or source, staying very focused to the subject matter and being very efficient. While this is great for learning, it left some of my curiosity unfulfilled. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging material, good balance of philosophy and psychology, excellent professor and TAs, I liked that each lecture focused on a single reading and expanded upon the topic, very fair exams, good help and feedback on essays\r\nImprovements: sections (at least my section) focused almost only on the philosophy readings and touched little on the psychology readings, but the discussions were very good ",
            "\u00a0Strength: enjoyable lectures and course material; the intersection of philosophy and psychology is fascinating: virtue, morality, religion, altruism, happiness\r\nWeakness: wish we went even deeper on some topics -- happiness, for instance; for the papers, we should have gotten an example paper because most everyone hadn't written this sort of paper before. The religion unit was also pretty anti-God. We should have been exposed to Barrett's ideas and religious prosociality. Also, it would have cool to bring in Bloom to argue his point of view. And for the replication crisis, I think it would have been cool to see Knobe talk about how some of his studies have failed replication. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really nice way for students interested in psychology to learn a lot and dip a bit into philosophy. Professor Knobe uses a lot of helpful heuristics and presents the material in a way that's very easy to understand. That said, don't take it if your main focus is philosophy. There just isn't enough time in lecture or section to do these ideas justice, and so a lot of time it felt more like we were skimming than really engaging the philosophy. The papers were a helpful opportunity to dive in more, but the class itself didn't prepare one for that level of examination. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Knobe is a great lecturer, however the lectures done by the TFs were often pretty unclear--often difficult to hear and sometimes poorly organized. The content of the course was incredibly interesting and the readings were not too heavy. ",
            "\u00a0good that there is section ",
            "\u00a0strengths: good lectures by professor knobe\r\nweaknesses: wish prof. knobe talked slower+louder, wish there was more information on the lecture slides (if you miss class/miss a part of lecture, looking at the lecture slides online isn't enough to know what he talked about), less dense readings, wish ta sessions were more standardized (in terms of structure, & also the supplementary material you get from your TAs) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Manageable Workload, Interesting Readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Knobe's voice sometimes fades out during lecture ",
            "\u00a0From day one, we were provided the tentative timeline for every lecture topic and every exam and paper through the whole semester. Because of that, the organization of the class was very good and we always knew what we were going to be working on every lecture and section. The greatest strength of this class is the curriculum and how the material was presented. After we looked at one philosopher's theoretical arguments one day, we also explore the empirical side of the argument and scientific data that we have today on that same topic. We got both levels of thought and really gave the enriching experience of this class. If you're looking for a \"survey\" humanities class where you explore different topics and thoughts from the great minds of history, this is a great class to take. Professor Knobe is also a great lecturer whose thought process during lecture is clear. The only weakness of this course is that Professor Knobe does speak soft and a little fast at some points of the lecture. You may not enjoy the class at the beginning because of this, but if you stick it out, there is a lot of great knowledge to be learned here. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it's a low workload class during the school year\r\nWeaknesses: There isn't much clarity on how final grade is calculated. Furthermore, each person's papers are graded solely by their own TFs, which leaves room open for all sorts of inevitable grading biases. I believe papers should be randomly graded or some other method to ensure continuity across TFs, because even though they may say \"They all try to grade the same\" we know that everyone's human, and that isn't going to happen and there will be grading differences. Given that papers account for something like 40 or 50% of the course grade, I think it should be standardized. \r\n\r\nAlso section quality varied a lot from TF to TF, some were great, some were not. Some had supplementary materials for their kids to look over before the midterm and final exam, and some did not. Given that TFs are something students pick according to schedule, I think this is a huge issue. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting material, enjoyed the balance and different sides to each issue\r\nWeaknesses: too much time spent doing broad explanations and not enough depth ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: pretty light workload, lectures were always engaging\r\nWeaknesses: exams tested memory a lot, there was very little support for the two papers ",
            "\u00a0strengths: got to see how philosophy and psychology interact to address similar issues \r\nweaknesses: the keyword here is similar. they're not exactly the same issues, so it can feel like these papers are just talking past each other and not engaging in true dialogue ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. Professor Knobe is engaging with his lectures and powerpoints, the readings are never overwhelming but always very interesting, and my TA was amazing so section was always very stimulating intellectually. The two papers we have to write are very open-ended in the sense that you can write about any topic you want that explores the readings we've done for the class, so I was able to think deeply about questions I've always had but never really took the effort to think through in such a precise manner. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Knobe is a really smart guy and a leader in the field. \r\nWeaknesses: knobe speaks quickly and is often a little hard to understand. Often the idea of the class  to combine philosophy and psychology to analyze human nature  is lost, as philosophy and psychology often adress only tangentially related ideas. ",

I left every class with a sense of awe about human nature, and how the readings we did so aptly addressed a lot of questions I'd previously had. ",

I had already taken a lot of philosophy classes but I think it would be a great way for people who are interested in trying out philosophy but don't want to start off by taking a more challenging intro course/aren't sure how interested in it they'll be yet. It's also a cool way for people who already have a philosophy background to learn more about how philosophy interacts with other disciplines. It does have brief weekly reading responses, but I actually liked that aspect because it ensured I really paid attention to the reading which made studying for the exams a lot less stressful. You also need to attend all the lectures because there's a lot of material covered in them that isn't in the reading, but I didn't mind it. Overall, a great course. ",

I learned so much and Joshua Knobe is wonderful. That being said, the organization of the course is not great. It is sometimes difficult to follow all the arguments, counter-arguments, and counter-counter arguments. The spaghetti structure of the material and arguments makes it difficult to study for the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The material was really interesting to examine from both a philosophical and psychological lens (and this is coming from a pre-med student with barely any background in either subject). Prof. Knobe doesn't assume that you will come in with any background, and really explains things from the ground up. It's really nice to have a course where you're examining aspects of human nature (e.g. Why do we help others? why do we believe in God? How do we make moral judgments?), rather than something abstract/inaccessible. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, Knobe structured the course really well. It is great as an introductory course, but if you're fairly well versed in psych and phil it might leave you wanting more. I wasn't super interested in the philosophy proper, but I thought the philosophical implications of the psych research were fascinating. The course is set up so you take an article from the philosophical tradition and compliment it with recent psych evidence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As I said before, this class is truly interesting and is a great educational experience. You can use the material you learn here to have truly meaningful and interesting conversations with basically anyone without (hopefully) sounding like a douche. At the same time THIS CLASS IS HARD. There is work. You will work every week. You cannot miss a class or discussion session or skip a reading without coming back to it a week or two later at the most. Be sure you know what you're getting into ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you love philosophy and psychology, and you wanna see how they could interact, this is an amazing course for you. The workload isn't that much, and most of the readings would spark your interest. There's enough freedom when writing your essays (it can be a psychological paper if that's what you're comfortable with, or philosophical. It can be on the prompts provided, or any prompt you want that engages with the course material). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is a great course, especially for students with no prior experience in psychology or philosophy. The course does not assume any prior knowledge from students, which makes it manageable as an introductory level course. At the same time though, due to its interdisciplinary nature, there is little overlap between material covered in the course with that of, for example, a traditional philosophy course. Therefore, I would also recommend the course to students whose interests preside over only one of the two disciplines, as the course does a good job of tackling issues fundamental to both psychology and philosophy in a novel way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who wants to develop a broad understanding of philosophy and the different fundamental perspectives that exist. There is a significant amount of reading involved, but the material is generally very interesting and Prof. Knobe is a wonderful lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course only if they happened to have a good TA. The material is very engaging, however it is hard to follow without a good TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is very well structured and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student - it is fun and insightful if you do the readings well and try to think on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is great to expand your knowledge in multiple focuses and point of view regarding the nature of human behavior or cognition ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was extremely interesting but it was a lot of work. You need to go to all the classes and take good notes because the lecture slides arent very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. My favorite class so far at Yale. Super engaging and interesting, well organized and structured, and the workload is quite manageable. Professor Knobe is also an amazing profressor and keeps lectures interesting and fosters learning quite well. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the subject matter, yes, take this course. If not, you're probably better off looking elsewhere (especially since the class fulfills few requirements). ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! This course is a great intro to important and engaging topics from both a philosophy and psychology perspective. The lectures by Prof. Knobe were great, and Prof. Knobe is such a kind person and cares a lot about his students. The TAs were all amazing as well and very approachable for help. The workload was light--one interesting reading per class (either philosophy reading or psychology study) and all the material was very coherent. Section is led by excellent TA's with great discussion, although we often spent more time than planned discussing certain arguments that there wasn't time to get to each reading. There was one midterm (very fair), two papers (you could choose to write either psychology research proposal or philosophy paper), and a final (very fair as well). Overall, a very well-organized class that will introduce you to very intriguing questions that will challenge your basic beliefs and assumptions on human nature. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for philosophers and those just dabbling with philosophy alike. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in psychology and want a light introduction into philosophy. All around a nice introductory course to both subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. I never found it difficult to pay attention in lectures because the topics discussed were so intriguing. Some of the best conversations I had this semester happened in my section for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Good first philosophy ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend. Interesting content, and a great introductory course to the study of human nature from both philosophical and psychological perspectives. Professor Knobe is a phenomenal instructor. Some of the readings could get confusing, but Professor Knobe and the TFs break them down well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the course is very well structured to give a survey of the main areas of human nature and serves as a great introduction to cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're looking to head into the humanities, Professor Knobe and the TFs are very knowledgeable and the class will make you look at abstract theories in ways you would not have. If you're looking for a humanities credit, this is also the perfect class because the workload is manageable while you also get to learn a lot of different \"perspectives on human nature.\"  For the workload, if it does not shift, is one reading response per week, two papers, a midterm and a final. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this, its one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale so far. Professor Knobe is amazing and the material is incredibly interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's low workload and interesting enough (good HU credit for those STEM majors lol)\r\n\r\nIt'll be kind of annoying about grading though :/ ",
            "\u00a0Yes, incredibly interesting with a very friendly professor. Good combo go psych and philosophy if youre not too familiar with either. ",
            "\u00a0It's a pretty cool, chill class! Take it with a friend! I happened to shop it randomly because my friend dragged me along, and ended up loving it. I learnt a lot of interesting things and was able to talk about a lot of interesting viewpoints. There really aren't a lot of downsides. ",
            "\u00a0hesitantly? yes, this interdisciplinary thing sounds cool, but it's a little frustrating in reality because you don't go into either psychology or philosophy with true depth. sometimes it feels as though the philosopher's arguments are being SparkNoted or trimmed down to fit the syllabus, and psychological studies aren't examined deeply because we don't understand the statistical tests or benchmarks of validity. did I learn a good amount from this class? yes, and now I have more material to work with in thinking about happiness, or the existence of God, or altruism. I guess I would say it's a good gateway or surface level exploration, but not anything more. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if Joanna is a TA again. I would bring up topics from this class almost once a day because I just found the concepts explored in class so fascinating and applicable (as one should, because, well, they all have to do with human nature). ",
            "\u00a0Yes but with several caveats. Two papers, a midterm and a final is a fair amount of work. The material is sometimes hard to follow and it often feels like youre reading things that are only somewhat related to one another. It is a really really cool idea for a class though. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good course to take if you want to learn more about philosophy, especially if you have not had a great deal of exposure before because there's also a lot of psychology involved. ",
            "\u00a0Sure--interesting stuff about human nature, but best part is definitely getting to think more about how philosophy can motivate psych experiments, or the philosophical implications of psych findings, etc. Great interdisciplinary stuff. "
