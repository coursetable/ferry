I learned an INCREDIBLE amount of information about how the US healthcare system is set up and some of the challenges with health policy - so I find that a win, however I had a hard time feeling engaged throughout the semester.  I understand the importance of making this course a required class but the large lecture hall and recordings (which I think led to a decline in student attendance) left me feeling like the course lacked depth. I often felt disconnected with course material, as there was not really an opportunity for sharing of ideas and more fruitful discussion of view points. ",

I think one of the best features of the class is the \"in the news\" segment. This really helped to tie together what we were learning in class with what is happening in the real world. This was an excellent opportunity to move beyond the classroom. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the exams and assignments were extremely fair, interesting, and transparent in the expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn my view, this class has no weaknesses, though I would recommend moving the policy workshops to a larger room. I also didn't like having to go to Alexion (not a comfortable room for a lecture), but there's nothing that can be done about that. ",

It's incredibly well taught, the syllabus and expectations are clearly outlined, and the material is compelling.

This course presented very useful material and Jason was a wonderful lecturer. Truly marvelous and well-designed! The main weaknesses in my opinion is the difficulty in understanding the grading system. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a true joy to take. Everyone loves Jason Schwartz, but also the subject matter is the perfect level of in-depth for the course. \r\nStrengths:\r\n-Professor interesting to listen to and course interesting. Medicare week was the best week of my semester. In my opinion, pretty much the only class that wasn't completely awful to have in a 200 person lecture setting (though even this one would be WAY better if it was <70 people. \r\n- Seems like the right level of work on a weekly basis, readings are really interesting for the most part. \r\n-I like the news part, gives me greater context around the things I read every day.\r\n-I will out myself as a policy student in case it wasn't already obvious :). I think the sessions we have with just policy students alleviated my feelings that this class wasn't in depth enough for us in the beginning. Also they were all great!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I really really wish one of the written assignments was more substantial or at least a policy memo. I have 3 different scholarship/internship applications due early next semester that require 5-10 page writing samples and I literally haven't written anything this semester longer than 800 words! This seems like the best course to add a longer paper too, and it does feel a little too \"easy\" to have all of the writing assignments be shorter than the prompts themselves :). Also I LOVED writing both essays, and learned more about health policy doing the research for each than I did in some other classes for the whole semester. I learn best through having to make an argument and researching, so it would be better to have an outlet for that. \r\n- The exams were kinda fun to study for, but there is essentially no incentive to come to class or do the readings (most students who got honors on the first exam seemed to have better luck joining a reading \"cliff notes\" pool, so probably did 2-3 readings max). I did all of the readings AND went to every class AND am a policy student AND actually know a lot about this class, but I didn't get an honors on the first exam. it was kind of hard to remember the \"bulletpoints\" on the slide for things like \"trade off\" when people who actually work in policy have a functioning knowledge of that word. The exams seemed to be graded in a way that reward memorization of slides alone. ",

I really liked that in conjunction to just teaching us the history and facts about everything, the class also incorporated interesting/incredibly time-relevant arguments to help us both understand how things have come to be (aka context and contingency) and why certain topics are so heavily debated still. I really enjoyed this course because it taught me so much: was just so helpful in understanding the current political climate and how today's polarized federal government is creating \"interesting\"/concerning problems for the state of healthcare.

Prof Schwartz really understands how to create an arc in the course, building upon key concepts.\r\nAs a medical student with little understanding of health policy, the course really hit on key concepts that allowed me to engage in many different HP topics.\r\n\r\nAssessments were VERY leniently graded with bonuses, with exam averages at 90%/94% respectively, and ~60-70% Honors on the two essays.\r\n\r\nLoved the fairness of exam assessments and the detailed manner in which exams were returned in sealed manila envelopes... while I did reuse these envelopes multiple times and this method of exam distribution seemed highly efficient, I wonder about the sustainability of this endeavor, in addition to the printing out of hundreds of assignment sheets. Very appreciative of the attention to detail and organization required but wondering if there were a more eco-friendly option in such a large course. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course!  I've never learned so much in a class as I have in this one.  The recordings of the lectures were incredibly helpful to retain information and clarify notes!  I think it would've been helpful to read a required book for the class, realizing that there isn't one perfect non-textbook that could encompass all of American health policy.  But I think understanding more about 1 perspective on the health system would be useful.  I think there were a lot of articles, which were interesting and well-chosen, but a book may provide deeper insight.  \r\nThe midterms could've had more specific feedback on the points taken off.  \r\nAlso, felt the rubric for writing assignments was a little unclear. ",
            "\u00a0No offense to the instructor and TAs. They are good at teaching. But I don't think this course should be a requirement to all MPH students. I am an international student majoring Biostatistics. The topic of the course is of absolutely NO interest to me, and since I'm not from the U.S., it is extremely hard for me to understand the U.S. health system and explain it in a professional way. Since all exams are close-booked, I had to spend a lot of time remembering over 1000 slides and I don't find it helpful to be forced to memorize the knowledge with no way to understand. From a Biostat student's point of view, the time should be wisely used to learn statistical knowledge which will benefit the students' future career more. This class is a complete waste of time for biostat students. It is not helpful since not all MPH students want to work in the policy field in the future. The knowledge is good to know but students should not be assigned to it. It is meaningless especially for international students since they don't come from the same health system. It is ridiculous that no matter what background you are from, and what major you are in, you are REQUIRED to take a policy class just to get the degree. As a graduate student, we should have the freedom to choose courses and design our own curriculum. I highly suggest to make this course optional to MPH students! For example, MPH students can choose 4 out of 6  core courses to study and this health policy course can be on the list, but it's optional for students to choose as a core course. Students like me just memorize over 1000 slides to pass the exam. It's unfair for international students who have never exposed to the U.S health system and who are not even interested in the policy filed to learn this course. The only point of this course for students like me is to lower the GPA. ",

The readings for this course were well chosen in terms of varying lengths, perspectives, and quality which I very much appreciated. The exams always felt challenging but doable. I liked splitting the course into two days a week as opposed to one long block. I think it would have been too much dense material in one sitting otherwise. I appreciated having the lecture recording available as a study aid. I enjoyed having poll questions in lecture, but more so that the professor would keep results hidden until everyone submitted. However, I did feel less prepared for the first writing assignment than the second writing assignment based on the material covered in lectures before both.

The topics brought up in this class were often brought up my seminar speakers and industry professionals at job interviews and I am so thankful for having taken it early in the program.

I also really love how he includes an \"In the News\" section because it keeps me up to date and for the rare times I've seen the article prior, Professor Schwartz always points out the more interesting arguments surrounding each article, which really helped me learn the material more and understand what's going on today and their implications. He's also a very fair and such a nice professor: I think that it's really awesome that he basically passes everyone as long as they are trying because I feel like that's how grad school should be: rewarding for trying not punishing for bad test taking.

            "\u00a0It answers the questions: Why is health care in America so confusing? and Are we making the right health care decisions? \r\nIt's really enjoyable especially if you like politics, but even if you don't it makes health care politics make more sense. Definitely take it. ",

I would definitely recommend this class to another student! Such a great class to start off a policy MPH (and all the other departments) because it really gives you an amazing insight as to how all the pieces of the US healthcare system functions and what role the patient (not consumer!!) has! Totally amazing and definitely the best core class! ",

            "\u00a0Well-organized course. As someone with little health policy experience, I initially found it difficult to follow Prof Schwartz's lectures because of his sophisticated diction, presented in lengthy sentences (with almost no breaths-- highly impressive)! I found that watching his videoed lectures at 1.5-2x gave me a better understanding of concepts. \r\n\r\nVery fair course assessments. Professor who is genuinely interested in student understanding. ",
            "\u00a0AWESOME overview of the American health system.  Starts off a little slow (especially if you've taken a political science class before), but covers a TON of relevant materials and does a really good job of incorporating information from the news.  Given how complex the American health system is, this class definitely does an incredible job of breaking it down. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course for students who are interested in the policy course, but I don't recommend it to biostat students unless you want to work in the policy field. MPH students can choose 4 out of 6  core courses to study and this health policy course can be on the list, but it should be optional for students to choose it as a core course. ",

The course will provide a strong foundation to the important roles of governmental and non-governmental structures in the creation of policy and delivery of care in the US. ",

Extremely well thought-out, carefully planned, engaging, and fair. This is perhaps the first course at YSPH (and I am now in my second year), where I found that I am leaving the course actually retaining relevant and practical information that I can use.
