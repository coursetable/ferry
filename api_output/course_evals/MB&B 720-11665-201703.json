            "\u00a0The course was a very good mixture of topics that in the end blended well together. I feel confident of my understanding of biophysical techniques such as Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and many others such as the fluorescent techniques of FRET, TIRF and so forth. The lessons that covered macromolecular structure were good and I feel that I obtained a better understanding of how macromolecules interact with eacho other. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the fundamentals of biochemistry and biophysics, both theory and experimental practices. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a variety of novel structural and imaging techniques while receiving a refresher in the basics of biochemistry and biophysics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of structural biology techniques, and honed my skills for reasoning through biophysical problems. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that most of the course was well-structured and I took knowledge from it. However, it became difficult to follow when there were too many slides being rushed through. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very useful in catching everyone up to the same level of broad technical knowledge. Some of it was necessary review but much of the cryo-EM and XRD sections was completely new and very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn a lot about the basics of biophysics, biochemistry, and structural biology. It was an introductory course but it was also quite in-depth which is an interesting balance. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more in depth understanding of basic biophysics and structural biology experiments/techniques and the rationale behind how they are used. ",
            "\u00a0Enhanced my knowledge on Fourier transform, crystallography, proteins and nuclei acids. ",

            "\u00a0General physical properties and functions of macromolecules.\r\nLearned in general terms on some biophysical techniques used today, which will help me in the lab when I might come across a technique we studied.\r\nMore in depth the basics and fundamentals of how cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography work.\r\nBasic biophysics was covered and I think I developed skills to think critcally about the biological system or question of interest that I will come across in my future work. I will be able to dissect the underlying molecular interactions that are the basis for biological function/phenotype. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course like how to think quantitatively about familiar biological phenomena. While learning about techniques and fields like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM was challenging, I developed the ability to understand what sorts of questions these address. This class definitely shaped the way I think about interactions between biomolecules. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop more intuition about the biochemical and biophysical topics covered in the course, which will help me in the future with my own research. It was a decent introduction to a wide variety of research topics that go on at Yale. It covered the fundamentals of the topics in such a way that if needed, I feel like I can go on my own to study the subject(s) more in depth if desired. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic knowledge of several biological systems as well as fundamental knowledge of the physical nature of biology. I also learned valuable information on the various techniques and tools used to preform research in a biophysics research lab. "

            "\u00a0It's a really good course, i just found it draining and due to my background very trivial. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is having many faculty teach the subject they are particularly knowledgeable on, as any questions can be answered well. Sometimes the content for this reason does not blend well between topics and feels like a sudden shift. This course could either decrease its topics or make it into a two course class where the topics can be covered in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very fast-paced and information heavy. While it is difficult for people new to the discipline, it is manageable. \r\n\r\nA major drawback of the course is that there is often a disconnect between information presented in lecture and information tested in problem sets and exams. This course would be better for students if the information from problem sets were direct reflections of the style of questions that will be tested on exams. Many problem sets and exam questions focus on minute details that are only found in one slide, as opposed to emphasizing bigger picture topics and knowledge. This is often times frustrating given the volume of information presented in class. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is stated that all of the information in the required textbook should be memorized, yet professors are not always good about assigning textbook readings relevant to their lecture material. Due to how much information is required to be memorized in this course, students would benefit from having concrete textbook information to fall back on when obscure details from class are not clear. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a wonderful support system, but sometimes the material presented in class was assessed at a different level of understanding. I think that providing more opportunities to evaluate our true grasp of the material prior to the examinations would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Cover a wide range of material. Organized well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Too many slides sometimes\r\n\r\nImprovements - It would have been helpful to know what was going to be covered in class so discussion section was just a repeat when students were presenting. ",
            "\u00a0Most topics in this course were covered with an appropriate amount of detail. I do think rearranging the curriculum could be beneficial for students' understanding. I envision the protein structure parts staying at the beginning, followed by light microscopy (Joe) and then cryo-EM and XRD. This would allow the principles of microscopy (FT, lens config) to be introduced in an intuitive and familiar way before expansion to more advanced techniques. The details of FT could be saved for XRD. I would also suggest doing one day on NMR (simplified greatly with focus on big picture ideas and maybe one example) and one day on mass spec if possible. Thermo and kinetics can be before or after the imaging topics. ",
            "\u00a0There was not a great transition between the professors. There were about 4 professors who taught the course and each taught different lectures, but there was no flow between the lectures. \r\n\r\nHowever, the course was graded very fairly and the professors' expectations of us students was very clear from the start. ",
            "\u00a0Individual units work well and individual lecturers' units are pretty coherent. Overall though the course is sometimes fairly disorganized in terms of the pacing of problem sets, etc. because of how many instructors are collaborating on it. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Joe's section on kinetics and lipids as the lectures were interactive and the problem sets were well guided. I wished the NMR series could be longer. ",
            "\u00a0The course is meant to be an introduction to the topics which is great however the way the exams are make it seem as if you should know these topics in quite some depth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth of material, expertise of professors, assignments, and strong communication from professors and TAs.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes felt like detail was lacking in lectures, lack of student engagement, and not enough concept checks. ",
            "\u00a0I think my strengths included studying for the exams ahead of time. Collaborating with my peers to better understand the course material. Attending every class and discussion section. The beginning part of the course material and the portion on thermodynamics/kinetics was more review for me and I was stronger in that area.\r\n\r\nMy weaknesses include the sections on X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. I also maybe did not take advantage of the TAs and instructors expertise by asking questions when I had them. Did not do as much of the recommended additional reading as I could have. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the amount of information learned in this course. Yes, it is a lot, but the organization is great. Another strength is the resources provided-- the book is good for background reading and there is so much information online about crystallography. A weakness of the course may be the discontinuity between how many professors teach sections, but that's understandable because the amount of information covered. This could be improved by having a \"what you should know\" slide at the end of all lectures, which a lot of people did do anyway. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that it was a broad survey course. The weaknesses were that the different professors had vastly different teaching styles and expectations for what we were supposed to gain from taking this class. It is fine to want us to develop an intuition for the material over blind memorization of facts. But oftentimes, in the race to get us to take away the aphorisms that are supposed to carry us into the future, we were missing the basic understandings to help us arrive at those big conceptual conclusions. \r\n\r\nProf. Howard did a good job of attaching PDFs on Canvas of supplemental readings from other textbooks he was basing his lectures on. It helped with being able to follow the main ideas of his lectures and helped me learn from his otherwise pictorally-dense-but-text-sparse lecture slides. The main suggestion for improvement would be if the lecture slides aren't directly based off the Kuriyan textbook, to make the material you're basing your lectures on available as supplemental readings so that the students don't feel as lost if it's the first time they're encountering the material (this is particularly the case for X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and NMR). It would significantly even the playing field for all the students who come from a wide variety of academic and research backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is that the student-led discussion sections were not as pedagogically useful as they were made out to be at the beginning of the semester. Maybe a total of ONE discussion section that served as a workshop on how to be a good presenter/TA... but it lost a lot of time that the students could ask the TAs for help to clarify what the professors were saying during lecture, or to go over the basics of the more challenging topics that were being taught during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0There is a bit of discontinuity between the manner in which each professor teaches but this is probably to be expected. It should also be more clear on how student presentations are evaluated for example the discussion sections led by students were not attended by many professors so perhaps it should be clear how we are being evaluated and get more specific feedback.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for the sole reason of being exposed to  a wide variety of topics that may not have been covered in an individual's undergraduate education. There are topics such as cryo-em that are not normally gone into as much depth as this class covers, which is beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this course is very good as far as required courses in the BQBS go. It is very challenging for students who are new to biochemistry and biophysics and has some issues with accessibility. Macro is a challenging course but overall good. ",
