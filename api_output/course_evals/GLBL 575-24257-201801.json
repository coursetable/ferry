            "\u00a0Great class - really enjoyed the topics and the small discussion nature of the classes. My class only had 6 students which led to a very interesting and engaging seminar format that helped develop my legal thinking and discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of knowledge about national security law, from the Civil War to the present, and a ton of insights into the post-9/11 security state that are very relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of critical legal analysis, as well as the relevant Supreme Court decisions regarding National Security. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great introduction not only to national security law but also what it is like writing and thinking about the law "

        [
            "\u00a0The class and the discussion question assignments in particular keep you engaged and thinking about the material. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this class had a bit too much work. The weekly discussion questions were very useful and the 20 page paper was also fun to write. Having a final exam on top of weekly essays and a final 20 page essay, however, was a bit much. Pick one or the other, we don't need both. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the guest speakers, the teaching, that each case is gone over really well from different angles. Take this course if you want to understand how the US has changed since 9/11 and how extraordinary that has been. The course could be improved maybe if we covered 15% less material, as we never got to some of the cases and while some of the assigned movies were useful like \"Taxi to the Dark Side,\" others took up time. We also never used the supplemental book that was required at the outset. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the class debates.  I felt that Professor Rangappa asked questions that guided us to interesting discussions on the course material.  The biggest weakness was the amount of class time for the material.  I felt that we needed a bit more time to adequately discuss some of the cases. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus could be better updated and matched to the current textbook. Also the professor could do a better job structuring class discussions. Finally, I think the format of the final exam should be changed because a 24 hr take home exam is brutal (worked on it for 18 hrs). "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes - if you like the course material the class is extremely interesting and engaging. It looks like a lot of work upfront but the weekly discussion questions are actually useful and worth doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is one of the few courses at Jackson that really makes you think and does not have a \"right\" answer, but forces you to explain your opinion with evidence. It is also essential for policymakers, or anyone really, to understand what is legal and illegal and the extraordinary role courts have played since 9/11 trying to rein in runaway executive power. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  There is a fair amount of reading, but I did not have much trouble finishing it in about two hours per week.  There was a lot of writing, but I felt that it came easily, as the material and questions asked elicited strong opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Asha is great. Also dont be scared away by the reading responses. They might seem like a lot at first but they get easy by the end of the semester "
