            "\u00a0How to read and write Devanagari script!!! Also learned a lot of grammatical rules that I did not know from being a heritage speaker ",
            "\u00a0I improved my reading and writing skills, and I also learned a lot of Hindi grammar and ways to improve my speaking. I see a clear improvement in my Hindi skills by taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't have any idea how to write in Hindi prior to this class and now I am fluent in reading and writing it. ",
            "\u00a0We went from learning the script in the first few weeks to writing short essays by the end of the term! ",
            "\u00a0Expanding vernacular, reading, writing, cultural awareness ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write a language that I had been speaking natively. I also learned how to examine language closely and its use. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about grammar in Hindi. I didn't know any grammar before. This class really helped strengthen that. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was being able to engage with the language in a very realistic way- how I hope to use it in the future, both in my career and traveling to other countries. ",
            "\u00a0Swapna Ji is amazing and cares a lot about the language, this makes the class really fun because we learn the language through discussion of current events, movie screenings, documentaries, short stories, poems, and more. Our class was structured so that one day was a grammar lesson and the second day was conversation and discussion on a certain topic. I wish the conversation and discussion happened in smaller section, since our class was pretty big and not everyone could practice speaking as much as they wanted to or needed to. The quizzes each week were fair and a good way to keep up with grammar and vocab. The presentations were fun, as they empowered our vocab even more to be able to talk about pertinent issues and topics. The final project was also not bad at all and I found it quite fun to make a magazine with three articles and two advertisements. The only weakness of the course is that no one really had any strong indication of how they were doing, in that grades were not really posted or updated. We had our quiz grades, but I was not sure of how they balanced out with participation, presentations, and the rest of the class assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this class, and we had a good combination of grammar lessons, presentations, discussions, short stories, and singing sessions. This course was very helpful in improving my Hindi speaking, reading, and writing skills. I loved every aspect of this class. ",
            "\u00a0More opportunity to read and critique each other's writing would be great. Strengths include a wonderful, casual class atmosphere and a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGood community\r\ngood professor\r\ngood material\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\ntransparency in grades ",
            "\u00a0The professor is a big strength. She is such a nice and caring professor. Another strength is the text book which is used. It explains the grammar and vocabulary in a very understandable way.\r\nOne weakness was that there were many people, but in a way that was a beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself is very nice, especially if you are already good at speaking Hindi. However, because this year there was such a large class size (~15 compared to the usual ~5) there wasn't much individual attention that the professor was able to give. Because it is a heritage class, everyone is at a different level with their Hindi. Due to the inability of being able to accommodate everyone's needs (because the class was so big), we couldn't even have a conversation section. Overall, you will learn to read and write Hindi and significantly improve those skills. However, most people's conversation skills did not improve significantly. ",
            "\u00a0Swapna ji is an amazing instructor! Although the material was dry at times, she did her best at keeping us engaged throughout the entirety of the course. She does work you hard though, and the weekly quizzes are a chore, but they're really designed to make sure that you're keeping on track with the stuff that is going on in class. "

            "\u00a0This class is a must take to learn Hindi! It's the fastest way to learn the language besides of course just immersing yourself in India for a few months. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, zaroor! :) ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants to learn how to read/write Hindi and wants to improve their speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's an easy class where you get to make close friendships and actually learn but in an individualized pace. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have some familiarity with the language and/or culture. You don't need much -- a longstanding affinity for Hindi movies can be used to build some solid language skills through this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you speak hindi at home. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is so fascinating to learn a new script and how to use it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! For any native speaker in Hindi who isn't strong in reading or writing this class is for you! It helped me so much! ",
