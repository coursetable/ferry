            "\u00a0This class is a practice of writing and acting, through various assignments of scene-work, monologues, writing, reading, and the final solo performance. It asks you to commit to writing every day as an exploration of your thoughts and feelings, and to work on performance theory. ",
            "\u00a0How to feel comfortable being vulnerable on stage, knowing fully well you are protected by the stage also. ",
            "\u00a0Theatre of Desire! The theatre is ours if we are willing to take it, a very empowering and hands-on approach to theatre and theatre-making. In addition, writing techniques and practices that I will continue to use long after I leave Deb's class. This class also opens an avenue to introspection and allows the realization of many self-insights throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a surprising amount of confidence, and I learned a deep amount about myself. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a place of both personal and theatrical growth. Not only did we gain knowledge from scene studies and the many exercises we did, but through our daily writing, discussions in class, and reading reflections we were able to grow as people. It was wonderful to be able to see other actors doing work, and seeing the many techniques that made their work improve. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the one-person play as a powerful medium. I learned the use of a personal journal in informing performance. I learned the value of writing every day. I learned the value of vulnerability in cultivating a community of theatermakers in class. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think this class is beautifully organized, and continues to build off of itself. Something you might say in class one day may turn into something incredibly important later. It is so cool when you have an incredible epiphany in the class due to the work you're doing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the warm ups we did at the begining of class and found the 2-page book jams helpful to reflect on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The intimate class size made the material more accessible in a way that was almost conversational, and probably facilitated honesty for each student. It really is a beautiful human course to have been part of.\r\nWeaknesses: I'm sure this course has some, but I do not think I have enough distance from this course to find them, I am still in love with this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not an acting class, per se, but a self-expression class. I thought it was very lovely. There isn't a clear structure going in, but I found there didn't need to be. It was such a joy to come to every week. I learned a tremendous amount. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really well set up. We read books and wrote reflections on them about five or six times throughout the course, which were great to interact with and get to think about the ideas and advice of the authors we read. Writing daily was also really helpful, especially for the presentations and the final performances, and also to better understand ourselves. The daily class exercises and getting to work closely with several class members also made the course really great! ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Deb is a powerfully passionate and kindhearted professor. The class has a loose curriculum, it really feels as if she creates it according to the needs of her students. That means we all feel heard and have the space to express ourselves, and we all got the most we could've out of her class because she learned how we learn and catered to it. \r\nweaknesses: because of the lack of a real curriculum, it wasn't always clear what her expectations were. I also wasn't really sure by what metrics I was being assessed. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to those in Theater Studies (it is a requirement for the major); if someone else was interested in taking it, by all means they should take the prerequisites and pursue taking this course because it is definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Deborah is such a talented person and has helped us become better actors. She has been very helpful in making us feel comfortable and creating a safe space for our writing. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! I was in Deb's section and its a great class for anyone really. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course is a phenomenal opportunity for any THST major to increase their repertoire of theatre experiences, and the instruction of Deb Margolin is incomparable to any other professor. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this class if you can. Deb is phenomenal & you learn a lot about yourself and acting during the course. HIGHLY recommend. It was my favorite class every week. I was always so excited to go. ",
            "\u00a0This class was my favorite at Yale. If you have the opportunity to take it with Deb, do it. It was truly an invaluable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!!! Take this class!!!!! Its such an amazing experience!!! ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. This was the most important course I have taken at Yale, perhaps not for my major, but for my personal growth. I highly recommend it to anyone considering the course, regardless of theater-background. BUT TAKE IT WITH DEB. "
