I had the opportunity to share with the group my paper presented at the Association of American Geographers. I gained skills in public speaking, facilitating Q&A sections, and creating a visual presentation. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I also learned how to write and revise an op-ed. This required developing skills to create academic writing more publicly accessible. ",
