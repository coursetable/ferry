            "\u00a0This course felt like a lot of busy work. While certain modules were very interesting (especially desalination, water&gender, and bottled water), others were very simple and I didn't feel like I was learning at all. I disliked having to meet with a group about the same topic every week all semester--I think it would have been a better use of time to concentrate more on the project at the end of the semester, rather than spending 15+ hours trying to meet up months before a 20-minute presentation. I often was unsure what we were being graded on, and when I asked for more details about expectations or grading I was not given any (however, the instructors did allow me to send in drafts for feedback). It was also very frustrating to me that class went significantly over the scheduled class time on many occasions. I do not mind staying late, but I think it needs to be communicated to students ahead of time (I had work right after class, and the instructors seemed surprised/offended when I needed to leave within 10 minutes of our scheduled end time). ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class is interesting and has great guest speakers. A good choice for the environmental science requirement. ",
            "\u00a0This class was targeted more towards MPH students than doctoral students, though I still benefited from it. Some assignments were not as clearly defined as I'd have liked, though instructors were always willing to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\nThis class mainly focused on the water sanitation, which is the basic issue for public health. The design of this class is paper oriented, which required each student read correlated literature before each class, and write the short summary on the issues the class would talk about. Also the weekly group meeting stressed team work on some specific cases, which improve the capability of collabration. ",
            "\u00a0A reasonable course.  Too many unnecessary pieces of homework. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely disorganized and poorly taught. There were unclear expectations for assignments and projects. Lectures were not engaging and professors were not helpful. Asked for a rubric for the final grant proposal and was not given one. Professors were unclear about what the rubric entailed when asked about during class. Assignments were not helpful in learning the material. Was hoping to learn more about this topic, instead I didn't learn anything new. Group project was confusing ",
            "\u00a0It was nice to have speakers from different background to share their experience. but I hope this course could be more structured with a clear outline and logistics of what we would learn during the semester and why it was organized that way. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the idea of the course and what it taught about water issues around the world. However several aspects of the course could be made better. For example the weekly 'team meetings' to do one group project at the end of the semester are a  huge waste of time.  Also, time management in the classroom could be better. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting course. Sometimes, the weekly responses felt unnecessary, but for the most part, I found them useful. \r\n\r\nThe weekly presentation meetings seemed too excessive. Requiring a meeting note every other week would have been sufficient.\r\n\r\nAlso, some classes felt much rushed or incomplete. While interesting, some group activities did not seem necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- The primary instructors of this course each brought their valuable expertise to help frame lectures and to teach students about important concepts in water, sanitation, and global health.  \r\n- Guest lecturers were also wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The lecture style was not always very engaging.  While instructors did provide questions throughout to leave room for discussion, the big class size also made it a little challenging to participate. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course to satisfy my EHS requirement and really enjoyed the instructors and class. The instructors were receptive to feedback and pushback, which really made me feel like students had a voice in the workings of the class. The workload was completely manageable and I felt that the material was very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0I believe this was the first year for this course and I liked it. The professors came from different backgrounds and they really did a good job at diversifying the material. The course was also incredibly interactive. I specifically enjoyed the field trip to the sanitation plant, guest speakers, presentations and debates. "

However, I often felt like I didn't know what he expected from students, and I also got the impression that he was frustrated with us and didn't want to be teaching at times. At these times he did not seem engaged with us or the material, which made it difficult to actively participate in class. ",

It covers some interesting topics related to global water supply and WASH techniques and implementation; however, it also includes many modules which were extremely basic and could have been left out or shortened, and I found assignments a bit confusing without rubrics. ",
            "\u00a0The class is fairly interesting and a low amount of work relative to other classes that fulfill the environmental requirement, so I'd recommend it on that basis. There are weekly responses due that are short, a final group presentation, and a final paper. I did not like the design of the debate class because the questions were really one-sided, making the opposing group's job impossible. I also don't think that forcing groups to meet every week is necessary. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Profs Chen and Wunder were responsive to student comments, and I enjoyed the course. You are required to meet with a group once a week on a powerpoint project (which isn't quite necessary, and I hope this requirement is lifted or lessened in future semesters), but it's overall a good course.
