            "\u00a0This class absolutely taught me what a high quality class discussion could look like, more than any other class I've been in at Yale every person was knowledgeable and articulate, and Matthew and Kate steered us beautifully. I learned an immense amount about how to think about forms of inequality and precarity in America. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly appreciated American Precarity this semesterthe students it attracted, the professors it allowed to feel like collaborators, the *project* of it all. This course did a great job of feeling like a semester-long question rather than twelve (right?) divided books. That came from the expectation and delivery of coherent, thoughtful reading responses and the ritual of having every student say something at the start of the discussion; in other classes, that style may not have worked, but in this one it did. Everyone had thoughts! I'm coming away from this class having a better sense of how to look at an argument or book from the vantage point of bigger questions, of class, race, and other narratives rather than taking it at face value. I also grew from the space American Precarity allowed for asking experimental questions. ",
            "\u00a0American Precarity introduced a wide range of anthropological tools to better understand constructions of class. In particular, it was a pleasure to encounter a wide range of ethnographic sources and analysis. The analytics of precarity is quite interesting but I had not run into it before. I looked forward to the reading every week. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is that every meeting was opening with a  go-around, during which each student had the opportunity to reflect on the reading and share some thoughts. Im a generally reserved student in seminars, and felt especially intimated in this one given that it was my first grad/undergrad course. The go-around really encouraged me to share my thoughts, and it allowed me space to think about the readings and ask questions about them which I found valuable and informative. I also really liked the format of the reading response, and want to adopt it to other classes as a way of keeping track of readings. It really helped me prep to write papers, and it was great to be able to read other reading responses before class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that a few of the books (Hillbilly Elegy, maybe Mushroom at the End of the World) didn't quite work, but other than that I felt like this was a near-perfect class. I would have also appreciated more direct engagement with the question of race. It seemed to be taken as a given that we were going to be discussion particularly white rural precarity in the class, but letting exploration of race beyond the one week (White Rage) might have been appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the quality of in-class discussion. The discussions, for the most part, often felt like conversations -- where people were actually listening to what each other had to say, rather than shoving in their point just for the sake of speaking up. I also thought the format of starting the class by going around the table sharing one insight about the book to be very helpful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this course was simply a lot more difficult than other AMST courses I've taken in the past, but I often found it difficult to follow conversation. Theoretical concepts/terms relating to Marxism, neoliberalism, and just economic history in general, I felt, were often presumed prerequisites. My AMST path at Yale so far (I'm a senior) has been pretty scattered and so while I felt equipped with the tools to analyze these books, discuss, read, and write, I felt like I didn't have the prerequisite knowledge at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course, I thought, had the right balance of professor/fellow-directed discussion and student-directed discussion. It was simple, but I really appreciated Professor Dudley starting off each class with her own preamble and then asking each of us to say something. Because we had already written our reading responses, we all had something we could speak about, and I think this allowed the entire class to feel more engaged and conversational. I also appreciated the grouping of the books, which did seem to maximize intertextual connections. \r\n\r\nI do wonder if the syllabus focused on the white working class too much. It's important, and fascinating, to talk about this group and its mythic quality, but the syllabus's lean towards whiteness somewhat perpetuates precariousness as a white quality. I felt like our questions about race had to mostly come from us rather than the books. That said, I wouldn't change the syllabus *that* much. But I would probably remove Hillbilly Elegy. ",
            "\u00a0At points it felt as though we could have done more to grapple with material constructions of race and class. However, as a course in anthropology, it allowed us to experience theorizing these constructions more, and grounded those theories in the material of ethnography. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class was great, but it is definitely a class where you get what you put in. If you keep up with the readings, engage in discussion, and try to really critically approach the syllabus and the material, then I think you can learn a lot from this class. This course is far from easy, and it challenged me to think and empathize a totally new way, for which I am really appreciative. The pace of the class is a little rapid, and becuase we do read a book a week, the workload is a little intimidating but I left the class with the ability to speak on and conceptualize whitness in America in a new way, which is so incredibly powerful and useful, especially now. I found myself always talking about this class with friends, and recommended several of the books we read to my friends. This was one of the more thought provoking classes I have taken at Yale, and am really grateful for all my peers who shared so much and taught me so much throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class in an instant, for any student who thinks they might be at all interested with the content. The readings assigned and class discussion were of the highest overall quality of anything I've seen at Yale. In terms of workload, the readings are undoubtedly heavy but not too dense, and the assignments (requiring no outside resources) are absolutely doable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a valuable opportunity to clear the cluttered air of the present. Take it if you want to read critically and deeply into current thinkers' takes on the problems of the 21st century (and their antecedent problems). Don't take this with the expectation that you'll figure out all the answers to the questions they raise, and don't take it if you want to talk about Trump all the time. This class is bigger than Trump, even if he helped it come into being! There's an expectation that you do the reading, and the weekly reading responses help keep people accountable. The paper assignments are loose and book-based. ",
            "\u00a0If youre looking for a critical examination of what class and work intersect with social and emotional experience in the United States, this is the class for you. In particular I enjoyed thinking about the nature of class and work in a way that I had not been pushed to in other classes using those categories. The reading list on its own is a good reason to take the course, and Professor Dudley is a masterful discussion leader. "
