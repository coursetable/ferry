            "\u00a0This course was a terrific examination of an unexpected subject. Drawing together disparate parts of the world and grappling with etymological, chemical, art historical, and historical questions (to name a few), the course was both engaging and enlightening. Being able to handle objects was an invaluable help to learning about them. "

            "\u00a0Certainly! It was a marvelous course, both awfully funnothing quite like hearing Ned discuss an object in detail, especially when one can examine the object up closeand very educational. It might seem like an esoteric subject, but the more we learned, the more it seemed to crop up in unexpected places and contexts...! "
