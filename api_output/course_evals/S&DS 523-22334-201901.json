            "\u00a0The YData course was a great introduction to Python for a data analysis. It was less effective, in my opinion, as a course on statistics and probability. The two together are perhaps too much for one semester; it may make sense to require a co-requisite or pre-requisite course in statistics. ",

            "\u00a0The assignments and content of the course overall were great. The lecture model could stand to be improved; there wasn't a ton that the lectures added to the comprehensive code that was available. It's hard to lead a discussion in a course of this size, but please consider either limiting the information that students see without attending lecture, or otherwise differentiating the lecture from self-study of the materials. The slides could be more substantive as well. The project assignments were perhaps the best aspect of the work. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing textbook - the best I've ever had for any class in my academic career. Friendly, accessible teaching staff. I would love for this course to be like CS50 for data science - CS50 has really dynamic, exciting lectures that fire you up about programming. This course checks all the boxes but I would love for the lectures to be more exciting. "
