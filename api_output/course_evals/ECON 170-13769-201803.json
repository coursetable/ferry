            "\u00a0It was really tough to learn the material. The curriculum is what the professor speaks, not what's on his slides, but it's tough to keep track of everything he says during the 1 hour 15 minute class sessions. Important concepts are presented very quickly because there's a lot of material to cover, but it makes it hard to follow the rest of a lecture when the most foundational concept was not clear. The exams also include stuff that was very briefly touched on, which incentivizes students to focus on memorizing really nitty-gritty details when studying instead of understanding how the system actually works. \r\n\r\nGuest speakers were really interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Forman was definitely a strength of the class. I loved hearing his perspective on these issues and he generally did a really good job of taking complex healthcare issues and making them interesting/understandable through anecdotes from his extensive experience in healthcare. ",
            "\u00a0I consistently felt like the TAs didn't care about the course, which was discouraging. But, the professor was great! He's been teaching this class for a long time, and he also has experience in both the policy and the delivery side of health care, which is nice. He is very approachable and can answer almost any question you throw at him. The last few lectures could be left off to give more time for Medicaid/Medicare/Insurance (what seems to be the more important lectures). \r\n\r\nIn general though, this class was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the clarity of the lectures/notes, because it really distilled a lot of the complex jargon to more understandable terms. Also, I really appreciated the various guest lectures and getting more perspectives on this subject. At times, the course felt less structured due to the lack of homework assignments, but there was an impetus to study more independently. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of information was rather overwhelming and the class can be boring at times. However, overall, it's a very interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0Class was great, my only criticism is that the guest lectures were often kind of disappointing. It seemed like in many cases the lecturers werent really primed in what they should be talking about, or what they said was simply irrelevant ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest lecturers, who all gave different perspectives about different facets of the health care market. We heard from a great mix of speakers, from a former director of the CMS to the CEO of Aledade to the CEO of Yale New Haven Hospital. I also enjoyed Howie's lectures, too. He is so knowledgable about the health care industry that it is both shocking and inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting material, not a lot of reading, exams arent that hard. \r\nWeaknesses: Curve can be brutal because exams arent that hard, Professor can be dull if you dont force yourself to pay full attention. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved a little slowly at the start, which forced us to rush at the end. The guest lecturers overwhelmingly brought insight to the course and the discussions we were having. Professor Forman has a good sense of humor; however, he sometimes rushes through the slides too quickly. Also, some effort should be made to give feedback on essays before they're turned in. ",
            "\u00a0Slides were hard to follow, Professor spoke very fast, and I often struggled to understand information because Professor would mention concepts or acronyms without explaining what they were/what they meant. However, the TFs were very helpful and I found the class very interesting and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredible and it covers extremely important material. If anything, I think that more sections (which were optional anyway) would be useful. ",
            "\u00a0It covered interesting material. I think at times it covered too many topics superficially and would have preferred to cover less overall material but in greater depth. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could be more planned out so that we get to all of the material before the end of class. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers are good for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting, very applicable knowledge that will be useful later in life\r\nWeaknesses:  SO MUCH MATERIAL. lectures were incredibly stressful as we would go through so much material with no time to process information ",
            "\u00a0Loved the multiple guest speakers we got. Always interesting people in very different parts of the health care world. ",
            "\u00a0Way too much information thrown at you. ",
            "\u00a0Gives a very strong overview of the US health care and health insurance systems. Information included is all very relevant, but could be organized in a better way (e.g. the lecture on what exactly the ACA did and the proceedings through Congress/SCOTUS was the very last lecture when it should have been one of the first). Taking maybe one lecture at the beginning of the course to ensure that students all understand the basics of what health insurance is, what the ACA did about it, etc. could help set up the course for better understanding. Slides are sometimes difficult to understand or it is difficult to grasp what the relevant details are and what is extraneous. ",
            "\u00a0the course provides a good, broad foundation for how our healthcare system is structured and what exactly is so wrong with it. the workload is reasonable, and the final paper was short and very flexible, allowing me to write on a topic that was most interesting to me. The grading for the homework assignments can sometimes be very nitpicky, but they allow students to go more in-depth into a few key concepts presented in the class. The lectures can be a hot mess sometimes -- they often stray pretty far from the slides, which is both a good thing and a bad thing - it's pretty frustrating at first, but then you can focus more on what Prof. Forman is saying, and how his examples/anecdotes illustrate the concepts in the class. The TA sessions, though optional, provided a useful second perspective on the course content to enhance my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures ",
            "\u00a0The course itself was fantastic. The only thing that I think could be improved is adding a practice test before the midterm. But I thought the questions on tests were very fair and I wasn't surprised by them. ",
            "\u00a0S: knowledgable professor and very important topic in future careers/adulthood\r\nW: no significant homework to provide review ",
            "\u00a0strengths -- the breadth and depth of material covered\r\n\r\nweakness -- lecture style could be improved by a brief recap at the very beginning of lecture, especially when we have guest lectures in between the regular programming ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Howie is truly and expert and brilliant. Weaknesses are that the TAs are not helpful at all. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the content about healthcare but it would have been good for some more economic background to have been provided where relevant. I think it also would have been interesting to discuss current events more and maybe to move the ACA lecture earlier. This would have made it easier to understand some of the guest lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting guest speakers, really enjoyed professor Forman's lecturing too. However, class wasn't paced very well. ",
            "\u00a0Terrible grading, TFs grade like asses. Lectures dry as hell. Howie is a good guy and he definitely means well. That being said, he is not a talented lecturer. He will tell you the first day people complain about his monotone voice, and to take it at face value. I thought it wasn't that bad and id be able to handle it. Trust me I was wrong, I could barely bare to sit through a single lecture within 2 weeks into the course. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: comprehensive. very low-stress.\r\nWeakness: disorganized. \r\n\r\nPlease be more selective with the information you want to relay. If it's irrelevant don't include it in the slides. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Forman was an effective lecturer who teaches at a good pace\r\nWeaknesses: Would be nice to have more guidance from the teaching fellows for the final paper and homework assignments ",
            "\u00a0It is detailed into healthcare, but there is little to no economics.  The class is very good if you keep it within those limitations. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are not super engaging, but the final paper was super interesting and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Professor was a good lecturer but the lecture slides are poorly structured. The PowerPoints have many slides with confusing graphs that we didn't need to memorize. Some content in the PowerPoints were also not covered in class which made it difficult to study for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Although the readings in this class were interesting and a bunch of interesting topics were covered, I sometimes found the lectures to be a bit dry / dense. ",
            "\u00a0For one, I would have loved to have TA led sections that were still optional (but structured), so you did not go only to have questions answered or listen to other students questions / answers. Secondly, I would have appreciated better transparency for grading. ",
            "\u00a0The course is useful in that it simply covers a lot of relevant information about the US healthcare system. I have two main suggestions. Firstly, the course could be better structured, as sometimes there were different definitions of terms or concepts between, say, TF office hours, slides, and what was said in lecture. Secondly, this class could include more theoretical health economics concepts. The level of theory in this class was fairly low and taught slowly, for instance we spent almost an entire lecture talking about elasticities in a fairly simple way. Given that introductory microeconomics is a prerequisite for this class, perhaps those can be taught with more depth. ",

How can we fix it? Answers to questions you will discover by taking this course. ",
