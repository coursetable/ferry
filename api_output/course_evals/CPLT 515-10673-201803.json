            "\u00a0The courese provided me with an overview of past and current theory in Comparative Literature. It enabled me to deepen my knowledge and introduced me to new ideas in order to gain a better understanding of theoretical appraoches in the field. ",
            "\u00a0This course is especially valuable for introducing us (1st/2nd year students in comparative literature) to a range of readings we might not have come across otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general overview of the history of comparative literature as a discipline and something of a \"behind the scenes\" look at how academia works and has worked. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a vast overview on the history and recent developments in the field. We went through canonical and less canonical texts and discussed each of them in the wider framework of questions regarding what comparative literature is. This is a great introductory course in order to know what out there. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a good insight into the texts that have contributed to shaping the discipline of comparative literature, and the main responses to those texts, as well as a good grasp of the main issues and debates within the field. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The pluralistic approach and the variety of texts: by contrasting different perspectives on the comparative work, we received a well-balanced view of our theoretical possibilities (ranging from Aristotle to the 19th century, from the 20th to current debates). ",
            "\u00a0While I think it is good on grounds of inclusion as well as interdisciplinarity that no one is turned away from the course, the large size of the class made it more difficult to feel a sense of collegiality/common discourse inside the comparative literature department than I might have hoped at the outset. ",
            "\u00a0The positive was that I feel like I got to read a number of key essays in the discipline's history, many of which are things I will continue to use in my career. There's low incentive to really engage with the course, but that's no fault of the instructor: no writing requirements and Sat/Unsat grading seems to be the problem. Every week on the syllabus felt necessary and yet it added up to something less than a satisfying whole. Was advertised as reading-intensive, but I think it had less reading than most courses I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength was the main weakness at the same time. Since we discussed a very wide corpus, the discussions rarely went deeper than a short commentary. On the other hand, the wide selection established an infrastructure for further individual inquiry. ",
            "\u00a0While the difficulty of offering the course every year is understandable, I think that the course would work better if it were available every year, so as to consist of a smaller group of students, which might be beneficial for class discussions, given that at times it felt difficult to contribute to the conversation. This is not only because of the number of students, but also because of their variety of backgrounds, which, while it provided compelling insights into how different people might approach the same readings, it also meant that class contributions were sometimes a bit disjointed. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course has a wide breath of introductory and canonical material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as it is a valuable introduction to the theoretical framework of Comparative Literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a comprehensive introduction to the field and its wider context in academia today. "
