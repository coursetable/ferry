            "\u00a0I have learned more about the Mississippi River valley this semester than I thought I would learn in my life. But further than that, I have been introduced to some questions about culture, the communities we pertain to, and the way we relate to our role in society that will stick with me long after this class has ended. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the Mississippi and of American history more generally. Prof. Hill made it a great introduction to the humanities for a guy who is typically stuck in the social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. Professor Hill teaches a different way of thinking about history. He is sure to include aspects from all different medias and genres to tackle a broad historical question. The methodology learned in the seminar is something everyone should be exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0The course sought to explain America's founding and development from a countercultural perspective -- that of the Mississippi River Valley. It was incredibly interesting and enlightening to understand how a different regional focus could provide so much new insight into a subject that is incredibly well documented. The class always made you think deeply and question what you thought you already knew. Using a variety of different media such as literature, art, music, and more to inform the class's studies was very interesting as well. ",
            "\u00a0Best course I've taken at Yale, hands down. ",
            "\u00a0To evaluate the nexus of diplomacy, geostrategy, history, philosophy, literary voice, theology and culture in constructing an intelligible field of study for statecraft: the course's deep investigations into nationhood in the Mississippi Watershed sharpens acuities for relation to failed states abroad, appreciation of humanity, and lucid understanding of America above and beneath its exceptionalism and common voice. "

            "\u00a0This course has amazing readings. I really enjoyed Mark Twain, John Barry's book on the Flood of 1927, and the works by Francis Parkman. I also enjoyed the student presentations - they were usually very good and gave a unique perspective on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Charles Hill makes this class - the knowledge and experience he brings to the table really is a huge strength. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps more people would take it if it was not on Friday. Besides that, it is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0The class and Professor Hill always facilitated incredibly informative and interesting discussions that often went in unforeseen directions, which always made the class exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Best course ever. No improvements needed "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is willing to be challenged by ideas that may not seem to fit in with the modern day - the Mississippi river valley has a long history and it is important to judge it though a nuanced view. I would also recommend this class to those who are okay with  waking up early on Fridays -not for the feint of heart. ",
            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course or any other taught by Charles Hill. He's a great lecturer and really opens up new ideas about what America is through his own experiences and research. I always left class with a few fun facts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the sort of course people should be exposed to at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course. Professor Hill is one of the smartest people you will ever meet, and taking a class with him will challenge you to think differently and will definitely increase your understanding of the world around you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Hill is the best professor I've had at Yale and a real inspiration. ",
            "\u00a0As with all of Prof. Hill's jewels, take if you can get in, and Charlie will polish your lens of vision for life. A course that derives statecraft from haunting histories of early nationhood in the Mississippi watershed, from the theological to the geostrategic. Prof Hill shirks subjective metahistories by keeping one vigilant eye on norms for which we ought to live. The class is a perfect opportunity to come to terms with what it is to be American, to assay failed states abroad for the sake of humanitarian aid, and to contemplate the potential many decades of your life ahead in this felicitous world.  This was a class to look forward to come Thursday night. "
