            "\u00a0The course did an excellent job of placing drylands into the context of other ecosystems and how their structure/function is unique. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about drylands ecosystem functioning. I also was pleasantly surprised with the amount of time spent on and substance of climate change issues and their impact on drylands systems. I didn't really expect to get that from the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very beneficial in building my conceptual understanding of ecological science material. However, it starts with the assumption that some things are already know to the student. It would be better to make some prerequisite classes like research methodology and physical sciences to ensure students come with some training of scientific writing and physical science concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped develop my knowledge of dryland ecosystems and plant communities, which was very useful for my master's thesis. It also gave me the chance to practice skills such as writing, reading, and explaining scientific ideas to others in the classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0Distribution of global drylands and their relationship to global climate patterns, a better understanding of nutrient cycling, and experience applying concepts of dryland structure and function to a hypothetical management scenario. "

            "\u00a0It was a comprehensive ecology course. ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectations. I learned a great deal and felt challenged and stimulated by the material. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills, and insights I gained in this class aligned well with my expectations. One aspect that came as a surprise was having to find a lot of information from scientific articles for assignments throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0The assignments, discussions, and lectures all complimented each other nicely to provide for a deeper learning experience. The assignments were left open-ended, which meant that it required more time and background research before starting. Limiting the scope of the assignments or recommending sources may take away from total learning, but also could greatly reduce the time required to complete them. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong substance in the specific subject matter of drylands. Bill is clearly an expert and it shows. Anyone wanting to gain an excellent base of knowledge about these particular systems should take this course. Content really great.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I think Bill thought we had understood a fundamental concept when perhaps we needed a little more explicit discussion on it. But that may just have been me. Bill is clearly a strong researcher. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting and useful but difficult to grasp if you don't have a background in physical sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course: (1) well-prepared presentations with helpful figures, (2) important material related to dryland ecosystems, and (3) writing practice. Weaknesses of the course: (1) there was not always enough direction for writing assignments, and (2) discussions were not as well organized as they could have been. The main way this class could be improved is through more guidance with the assignments, and also better organization of discussions to get students thinking about readings more critically. ",

Ask questions if you don't understand something and don't get behind!\r\n\r\nI liked the class a lot. I was pretty stressed about it for the first month, partly because I was out of my comfort zone in terms of subject matter, and because I found the writing work load more intense than I had thought it would be. Then I settled into the rhythm of it and things were fine after that.\r\n\r\nI learned much more than I expected to and my interest in the subject matter was stimulated to the point that I will likely continue to study it. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you are engaged with the readings, lectures, and writing assignments! Also, don't be afraid to ask for help! ",
            "\u00a0If you get hung-up on any of the concepts or homework questions, don't hesitate to meet with Bill or the TA about it. The homework questions are designed to make you think about the concepts presented in class and to ensure that you have a solid understanding of the material, so it is worth your time to make sure you understand them!
