            "\u00a0I was challenged to think about problems in a specific economic way. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in understanding economic principles and foundations. The extra math help in the class is great even though it involves having an extra class on Fridays. ",
            "\u00a0I know a lot more about economics now, and my ability to think about economics was definitely improved. ",

            "\u00a0Tolga is very helpful and encouraging, and he makes it easy to succeed. However, sometimes you feel like you aren't learning, rather just getting answers at office hours to get your points and learning formulas to regurgitate information. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the small, personal aspect of the seminar and the accessibility of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the lectures could have gone a little slower with more concrete examples of the problems we were learning. Tolga is great but sometimes when you're asking a question and don't understand the way something was explained he will just explain it the same way instead of a new way. ",
            "\u00a0The course is absolutely phenomenal for anyone who wants to learn Microeconomics but has not taken any advanced Math classes in high school. I cannot find any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught but differs from the textbook we use, particularly towards the end of the course. Switching textbooks or stating this more clearly might help the course as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved with more focus on the math based part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that towards the end of year, the class seemed to fly by and I found that I did not have enough time to process the information I was receiving. However, I still looked forward to going to class because Tolga kept the material interesting and he provided us with a lot of outside resources to help with our learning. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it is a seminar and the instructor can more thoroughly explain the material and offer several examples to solidify concepts.\r\nI think it could be improved by devoting the additional section mostly to solving mathematical examples, as we were originally told, so that it is easier to understand the material.
