            "\u00a0wouldn't necessarily call it busy work but \"annoying work\" is a better description of the assignments. plus some of the studies were just awful. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have benefited to have had more contextualized lessons. We should have touched more on the broader systems influences of health nd how those broader mechanisms are at play on the individual level. ",
            "\u00a0Great class with such interesting discussions every week!  Although various viewpoints were brought up on every topic discussed, I was impressed with how cordial the environment was and felt comfortable if I wanted to express my own opinion/viewpoint.  Interesting topics presented, and as a non-SBS student, I thought the course was very approachable and interesting! ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome. I wish there were more SBS classes like this, that dive into the issues we only scratch at the surface of here. There are so many complex issues that we started to discuss, and I learned so much information that will be important as I move forward in my MPH and in SBS. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great overview of all the important SBS topics! ",
            "\u00a0Enjoyed reading assorted articles on a range of various topics - good overview, but definitely from a birds-eye view. Did not go into much detail on assigned readings or topics in lectures. Surface overview of related topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learn a lot about a variety of areas of social research, specifically on social networks and their impact on health. Very informative. Weakness: didn't delve as deeply into the theory and material as I would have liked. Was much more an overview of the material rather than teaching students the theory and mechanisms underlying these social relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Served as a first pass at many of the issues, concepts, and research in SBS that I did not know previously.\r\nWeaknesses: The course spent too much time in side discussions and not enough time discussing the hard researched that drives the field. ",
            "\u00a0Poor course. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a good overview of the social and interpersonal influences on health and the final paper is a cool opportunity to explore something you are interested in from this lens ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The PowerPoints were well-organized and thorough.\r\n-- Assignments and class materials were prepared in advance and presented in the syllabus at the start of term, so students had the opportunity to plan ahead and work at a measured pace, in congruence with individual schedules. \r\n-- Grades were based on weekly assignments rather than just a heroic final exam or paper. This privileged steady, cumulative work over a last-minute rush of questionable value.\r\n-- Students were able to choose the topic of the last lesson, which gave us a sense of agency and allowed us to explore a timely issue that we might not otherwise have examined in class. The professor brought in a Health Policy professor to give that lecture, which gave us a helpful additional perspective.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I cant take the class again. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good introduction to pertinent concepts and state of research in SBS. However, it is very shallow and lacks substance. Being a required course for SBS it would be ideal to have a much more advance course in one of the core SBS subjects. The content is very relevant, but the lecture could go deeper into the state of knowledge, the research, the debates, and especially the different schools of thought and theories behind regarding the topics. I believe this is a bit the intention of the discussion sections. However, the quality of these significantly vary according to the TF that leads it and the work they entail feels like busy work with not a lot of value. I believe the substance of the discussion sections should be addressed in class, with Professor Monin leading them if the intention is for them to be valuable. Half the class could be an in-depth presentation of theory and concepts and the second half into research and discussion. As it stands now, there is no reason for this class to have a discussion section and a weekly assignment, since the work students put in is not commensurate to the obtained benefit. "

            "\u00a0Joan was awesome!  I absolutely loved having her as a professor and would take any of her classes in a heartbeat.  It was great how she kept the conversations in class on track yet let it go to topics that other professors may not have handled as adeptly.  When a student would present a viewpoint she would encourage further thought into the subject matter by asking them interesting and thoughtful questions and it was always so great to hear about her research and life experiences when the topic approached something that hit close to home for her.  Sad to see this class end, I had a great semester! ",
            "\u00a0Joan was cool, pretty theoretical though. Don't really get into the weeds of public health practice. good for social psychologists. ",
            "\u00a0Joan is amazing! She is super responsive and helpful, and really takes an interest in getting to know her students. ",
            "\u00a0She's a very engaging instructor! ",
            "\u00a0Joan is very sweet and bright, but I wish her lectures had more of a social justice lens, and I wish that she felt more comfortable tackling difficult issues and topics brought up in the course ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Monin was a great instructor. She was very engaged with students and conducted classes in a way that really got students to discuss the theories we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joan is passionate about the subject mater and follows up with students who are interested in specific topics from class to grow their understanding of the subject matter\r\nWeaknesses: Joan is too nice of a teacher. Early in the semester students had many complaints about the articles from the course. After standing up for her decision process, students seemed to not have as many issues. By being so accessible and understanding Joan opened herself to criticisms that I felt were over-exaggerated. ",
            "\u00a0Feedback on the 15 page final paper was two lines...after that much work, I find it unacceptable to not have more constructive feedback at the graduate level. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Monin is very kind and provides a safe space for students to share their thoughts. Sometimes, I wish she would have cut off conversations to make sure we are covering the materials - learning from her expertise. People told a lot of personal stories that sometimes were helpful but sometimes were off topic and too long. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The professor was by far the best educator to teach any of my classes at YSPH. She was clearly aware of the latest classroom teaching methods (or was some kind of savant who came up with everything on her own). \r\n-- The professor encouraged student participation, and made topics relevant. She spoke about her own areas of expertise, and also spoke eloquently and enthusiastically about a range of important topics.\r\n-- This professor understood what most YSPH professors dont: no matter how shiny your curriculum is, you will not have taught anyone anything if you dont actually engage students brains. The professor designed a great curriculum, but always made student engagement and discussion her highest priority, which meant that we actually learned and retained much of the material. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: She hasnt taught other professors how to be more like her yet. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Monin is very approachable and accessible. She is engaging, and genuinely interested in her students. \r\nWeaknesses: Though, she is certainly very knowledgeable but sometimes can have difficulty conveying it. Often the time spent in class doing \"active learning\" exercises (i.e. small group discussions) are not as valuable as they are intended to. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course. I really enjoyed learning about various topics that all intersect as public health issues. It was fun to write the final paper on something that interests us. I liked the small discussion sections, it allowed us to comfortably share our opinions. ",

            "\u00a0This course is great intro course for topic in sbs no matter someones background. Do not enter the course expecting a detailed look at any of the concepts given the time constraints. There are many other topic specific courses at Yale that fill this role. ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in Social and Behavioral Studies. I was not required to take this class  I had the option of taking an online version. Im so glad I took the real class. It was worth it, the professor and TAs were great, the in-class discussions were great, and I learned a lot about the field. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you know nothing about psychology/sociology, behavioral sciences, etc. Do not take it to strengthen existing knowledge. "
