            "\u00a0The course organization was not the best. Less instructors would help. Some lectures had overlap. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is to use a lot of structure detail to elucidate the mechanism of the target inhibitor. It would be better if teacher could arrange the range of teaching so that we won't have redundant class. ",

Also, the instructors always relate the knowledge to real-life examples to get us more motivated to study the basic concepts. However, the tests are very daunting. They were brutal. But as long as you studied what was discussed in class, you will be fine. ",
