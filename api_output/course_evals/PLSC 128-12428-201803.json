            "\u00a0This class was very interesting and practical if you're interested in humanitarian aid work of any sort. While it was sometimes difficult to see it's utility while in the class, looking back, the presentation of theories and case studies forced us to think critically about the ethics, structure, and evaluation of humanitarian intervention in a very engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of international relations, humanitarian intervention, and foreign aid work has immensely increased. I feel I understand human behavior a bit better, and can navigate the treacheries and complexities of aid work and civil conflict. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches the theories and methodologies behind counterinsurgency and aid efforts in conflict zones around the world. The first half of the course provides a background into past aid efforts and the rise of \"new aid\" post-9/11. It goes into the structure of rebel forces, the idea of the military building legitimacy through \"hearts and minds\" and why people believe certain programming will succeed or fail based on theory. The second half of the course explores research methodologies by breaking down impact evaluations and the different challenges to research in violent settings. The midterm is traditional with IDs and essay questions based on the theory learned, but the final gives you an opportunity to build a fake impact evaluation from scratch, taking into account logistical, methodological, and ethical issues. ",

We studied different aid projects and their successes/failures all over the world such as Colombia, the Philippines, Afghanistan, and Iraq, to name a few. You get to learn what being an aid worker is really like, for Professor Lyall and all of the TFs had plenty of the experience in the field that allowed them to tell us real-life stories from their experiences which was very interesting!

I substantially improved my understanding of development aid and the dynamics of foreign interventions, as well as gaining a much stronger practical understanding of what has seemed to work so far in development and humanitarian aid.  No joke, this class changed the way I look at international interventions and think about development in poor/war-torn nations ",

            "\u00a0Wow what didnt I learn during this course? I learned so much about different conflict zones around the world. I learned how to conduct an impact evaluation, how to think about ethics, and how to apply theories. I also learned that this midterm was super hard and harshly graded so beware. I think the final, albeit hard, actually helped with my comprehension of the course material. ",

            "\u00a0This course teaches about the theory behind political violence, aid projects in conflict zones, and impact evaluations for the aid projects. In terms of the theory, we evaluated the ways in which the state, rebels, and civilians all impact civil wars and insurgencies. The aid projects we learned about mainly focused on post-9/11 quick impact impact projects, and we examined case studies from all over the world. Finally, we learned about not only the importance of impact evaluations, but also how to carry out impact evaluations ranging from randomized control trials (RCTs) to ethnographies. ",

Developed the ability to read randomized control trials, regression discontinuity designs, and other methods of development aid evaluation. ",

I learned about the sometimes backwards nature of humanitarian aid and crisis intervention, and how we can prevent such scenarios. I now feel far more comfortable discussing international relations and humanitarian crises amongst my peers. I found this class to be a strong, productive stepping-stone towards designing and conducting my own research in this field, as it outlined many different research methods for us and gave clear real-world examples. ",
            "\u00a0I rediscovered my passion for global affairs and learned so much about humanitarian aid that I had absolutely no knowledge of before taking this course. Development Under Fire opened my eyes about issues regarding humanitarian aid that are not widely known but extremely pertinent in our world today. It opened my eyes to how much more work we need to do in terms of figuring out what kind of humanitarian aid actually works because most if it doesn't work. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were always so clear and well planned and organized. If I didn't understand my notes, I could go to the lecture slides and understand what I was missing. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great. It covers a massive amount of ground really efficiently. I don't really have complaints. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- Professor Lyall is an amazing lecturer, the readings are diverse and interesting, each assignment felt different and challenged knowledge in a different way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- N/A ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly well-structured for learning. It provides the theory at the beginning to ground the methodology learned in the second half. Professor Lyall will break down the different studies in class as well, helping you gain confidence in your ability to understand complex social science academic literature. A weakness would be a lack of explanation as to why we are there in the first place. The theory overview very much starts from a place of already occupying and providing aid in these places and why we are doing that, but it would be valuable to have one or two lectures providing more of the history of not only \"traditional\" aid as was mentioned in class but why the US/West has gotten so involved in the first place. This class also tends to attract a lot of...strong....personalities that can make section very intimidating for someone who has absolutely no background on this subject. So lectures are beyond fantastic but section was not the best. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the organization of the course and felt that it facilitated my learning. I would have liked a more formal review session outside of class in which we could ask questions, both for the midterm and for the final. I also wished we had more feedback on the midterm. I also felt that the grading was unreasonably harsh on the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lyall is an extremely engaging lecturer, and I looked forward to coming to class each week. The workload is minimal throughout the semester, but you definitely still have to work for the A-/A! Weaknesses: The course is very reading heavy. At first, it may seem like doing the readings is not essential for the course, but when it comes time for the midterm and final exam, not having done the readings and taken notes on them will be very detrimental to your grade. For the first 3-4 page reading response in part 1 of the course, I felt like the expectations were not clear in what we had to do so it was a bit difficult. However, after receiving feedback, I knew what the TFs were looking for, and I was able to recover on my essay for part 2 of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Jason Lyall is the coolest professor Yale has right now. And the TFs are all super amazing. \r\nWeaknesses are that sometimes the readings were very dense, and we did not have time in section to go over all of them. ",
            "\u00a0All the readings are so interesting and educational if you manage to get through them, but I got so bogged down by the magnitude of pages I had to read each week. The first half of the term is especially brutal because the readings are entirely theoretical and so dense. One day I just broke down and changed the class to Cr/D because I couldnt handle the reading. Otherwise, though, we had great discussions in section about the readings (that I didnt do), and it wasnt really necessary to have gotten through them all to participate. A huge strength is Professor Lyall, who is not only a wonderful lecturer but also a lovely man and father (he brought his son to the finalso cute). He made a lot of funny jokes in class that really helped lighten the dark tone of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are really engaging and interesting. The sections feel more like a drag than anything else, but they certainly help to clear stuff up (assuming you do the readings...). The final exam involves crafting an aid program and evaluation, which makes it feel less like a theory class and more like a practical application class, which means you actually learn something for the exam as opposed to just memorizing and forgetting. ",
            "\u00a0Well, it could be improved by retaining Professor Lyall, for one thing.  Besides that, i think it was a well-structured course that struck a good balance between theory and practice, as well as providing a solid grounding in the methods used to measure results and compensate for unavoidable data issues.  Those sections were quite, boring, but I can understand why they were important. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lyall is an incredible lecturer. I loved the theory section, but was a bit less interested in some of the specifics about how aid is delivered. I would personally prefer a more theory-heavy class, although I imagine other people say the opposite. I also think theres room to ask some bigger questions in the class  to zoom out and ask about whether the US and the international community should intervene in other countrys affairs, and what we would stand to lose or gain with he successes of the insurgencies the course studies. Excellent that the class focuses on ethics in such an comprehensive and deliberate way. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are level of engagement and clarity of information. The lectures given by Professor Lyall are clear and engaging, and the sections after class allow for closer discussion of key concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the final even though it was hard helped sum up the course material and helped me use it in a real life situation. Professor Lyall was a very engaging lecturer. We got to see many different conflict zones. It was good that it didnt just focus on the Middle East. It made me see America in a new light and that light was not positive. Section was definitely a major strength of this class. It helped explain some confusing things from lecture and readings. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the midterm required too many things to be done in a very short period of time so it didnt help my learning of the material at all. The readings were sometimes super unclear and hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great lecture style and insightful content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Teaching Fellow Liz McGuire. Absolutely no compassion whatsoever and the harshest grade I have faced at Yale so far (sophomore). I hope to never have a teaching fellow like her ever again. Not just me--there was widespread discontent and large #s of credit/Ds after the first midterm...\r\nProf Lyall also seems to be disengaged with the grading and facets of the course, other than the content. ",
            "\u00a0All the teachers of this course have real-world experience with the subject and that was an incredible strength. Professor Lyall has been to Afghanistan and worked there. Even the TFs had a lot of experience that they were able to share. The course is so interesting and it feels extremely important and relevant to study, which is something many courses don't achieve. The only weakness may be that the first half of the course is very theoretical. Professor Lyall should probably bring up reminders more often about the arc of the course, and why what is assigned to a certain week is an important step to take and understand before the more interesting weeks arrive. The final was pretty fun too! ",
            "\u00a0Really engaging and super comprehensive lectures, dense but interesting readings. I felt a little less comfortable with the experimental methods + more time could probably have been dedicated to breaking down the impact evaluations -- would have helped a lot with the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very strong in teaching students about the intricate interplay between aid programs and local populations. It conveyed the difficulty of trying to \"do good\" while also being able to realise that it is not easy for a program to be entirely successful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- reading material and lectures were really engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material is generally really interesting and Professor Lyall was incredibly engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: there were often readings that were dense and generally unnecessary.. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: lectures were very engaging, lecture slides were well organized \r\nweaknesses: readings were very long and dense, sometimes the course moved at a fast pace, discussion sections were not as beneficial as I had hoped but meeting with my TF outside of section was helpful \r\n-could possibly improve the variety of assignments and readings to diversify the workload ",
            "\u00a0interesting topics and content, but would appreciate more feedback from TF and clearer rubrics/directions on what they are looking for in assignments ",
            "\u00a0Very in-depth, but too fast paced ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Lectures benefited from the use of anecdotes and multimedia resources, and the readings were very interesting, especially since their themes were tied back into lecture. The latter half of the course was also well structured, in that themes from the first half would be applied to the specific case studies in the second half. The course could be improved with more guest lectures, especially from those who can provide different perspectives about aid types and the countries their distributed in. ",
            "\u00a0Does a good job covering a lot of information in a short amount of time. However, there are a lot of readings each week, and it can be hard to stay on top of them. If you fall behind it can be hard to catch up. ",
            "\u00a0There was too much discussion of theory and evaluation techinques and not enough review of U.S. foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that it is a fascinating class that covers genuinely interesting and applicable topics. One weakness is the fact that the readings for each week are scattered around the internet, which can make them really hard to access. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lyall is amazing. His lectures are super entertaining and very very interesting. I would have appreciated more information as to what they were expecting from us in the Final and the midterm. This course is made up of vast amounts of theories and readings that can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially when you must \"incorporate\" them into the final. Proving our learning seemed quite difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Could have been more interactive \r\nCould have proposed more solutions to the problems it posed ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lyalls teaching style was a major strength - he taught everything very clearly. I liked the theory part of the course better than the RCT portion, so I would like more focus on that. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very reading-heavy, and while every reading was helpful, I feel that sometimes they were not addressed enough in lecture or section. Section was very helpful, but would sometimes only focus on one or two readings; perhaps an overview of all of the week's readings may have been more useful. Outside of this weakness, I think the reading selections for the course were excellent - the examples were clear and applicable to our assignments. \r\n\r\nThe only other weakness I would point out is the Response Paper assignment. We were expected to write two response papers, which were extremely flexible and asked us to \"respond\" to the readings in some way. While I think that this is certainly a worthwhile assignment, the time frame in which they were done made it difficult for us to construct the best papers possible/go to office hours and receive help. My TA held section on Wednesdays (lecture met on Mondays and Wednesdays), during which we would discuss readings from the previous two class periods. Since our Response Papers were reading-based, they would be due the day before the section meeting during which those readings would be discussed. This would allow a week or less to prepare the paper, based on the reading schedule. While this was certainly feasible, it was sometimes difficult to go to office hours or discuss papers with the TAs prior to their due date. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include interesting lessons and relevant information that incorporates current events, past events, and important theories. This course was what I expected it to be and more in terms of opening my eyes to the different facets of humanitarian aid. \r\n\r\nOne improvement could be putting up the lecture slides before the lecture, because looking through the slides helped a lot in terms of understanding the long, dense readings we had to do each week. That way, we could be more prepared before going to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is the enormous amount of reading assigned each week ",
            "\u00a0WHY DID YOU DENY JASON LYALL TENURE!? ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! The course was structured so that we learned about theories in the first half and then studied impact evaluations in the second half, so it was cool to see how the theories applied to actual situations and research. I liked how we studied lots of different conflicts around the world because I feel like I got a strong sense of the current state of research in this field. This class has a lot of readings but Professor Lyall does a good job breaking them down in lecture, and overall the work load is not that bad because there are only two short papers, midterm, and the final.

            "\u00a0Yes! Anybody interested in foreign relations, civil war, or humanitarian conflict should learn from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. I came in as a STEM major with absolutely no background, and while the people in section were intimidating and turned me off from the course at first, I found that synthesizing all the material in studying for both the exams left me with a deep understanding of what we talked about and the ability to make connections between different theories and research designs. The theories discussed in this class of rebel governance and mobilization can be applied in many contexts around the world. The structure of the course is extremely useful -- you learn foundations before moving onto practical implementation in field experiments. Professor Lyall is incredible, keeping people engaged in lecture by pretending to be not hip and cool (but actually being a big fan of Marshmello). He takes the material seriously, appeals to the human side of these impact evaluations, and shares stories about his experiences as an academic researcher in Afghanistan that will stay in your mind forever. He doesn't take himself too seriously though, and that makes lecture fun as well as truly soul-touching. After this class, I feel like I can actually talk intelligently about international crises in violent areas, what foreign aid providers are doing, why they are doing it, and the issues with their different approaches. I also feel more comfortable reading dense social science literature by learning how to break down arguments and assess methodologies. ",

He knows the material very well and always told stories about his time in the field, which was super interesting to hear about. I only took this class last year because a friend recommended it to me, and I am so happy I stayed in it. I felt like the first part of the course which was more theory-based was not that interesting, but the second half of the course where we learn about real world aid projects made up for it. I found myself extremely excited to go to class each week and loved every second of it! ",

If youre not in political science or global affairs you should not take this course. But if you are into both of those subjects like I am you will love this course. This course, however, is challenging in terms of the rigor and material. I learned so much though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but don't choose Liz McGuire as your teaching fellow if possible. But the course is a must-take for global affairs majors and anyone else interested in foreign aid and middle eastern contemporary affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is an excellent course, especially for people who want to become more mindful global citizens. It helped me to become more grateful for what I have. It can be kind of depressing though, to study such intense violence and hardship, so prepare yourself. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! Professor Lyalls lectures are absolutely riveting, and his personal anecdotes add a lot of life to the abstract concepts. Early in the course, the readings can be somewhat dry, but they are an important foundation for the much more interesting readings later in the course. Overall, this is a must take course for anyone interested in international relations, on the security and/or development side, or anything related to military affairs, NGOs, or humanitarian work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if you're interested to learn more about development, insurgency, peace-building in conflict settings... ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any other student. No matter what major. It is important to learn about the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of foreign aid programs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely loved this course! Professor Lyall did a great job of making sure the dense readings were accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Lyall is super engaging and the coursework is really relevant if you want to get a basic understanding of how aid and counterterrorism projects function. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is essential for any Global Affairs major. The information that we learn in this course is a synthesis of the security and development tracks. Learning how to evaluate studies the way that we did in this course is also very important for all social science majors.  Professor Lyall is also an incredibly engaging lecturer, one of the best at Yale. He can make the 50min lecture fly by. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a really excellent introduction to aid and development as it plays out around the world. It can be a difficult course to approach though with no prior knowledge in the field. But, if you are interested in the topic, then definitely consider taking it and maybe Credit D it if you are a little worried about the workload because it can be a lot. The course is what you make of it so if you put a lot into it and attend lecture and do the readings, then you will be rewarded for it and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend taking this course. Very interesting topics and a fairly light workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the class and my TF was involved. ",
            "\u00a0Yes to learn the basics of how to approach failed states. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course, especially to students outside of the poli-sci department, as there isn't a huge expectation on knowing political theory and the intricacies of that. The class is super interesting and could provide students in the polisci major as well as outside of the major with skills to understand the security challenges in the world today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although it was a rather difficult course, I would argue that what you learn far outweights the costs. ",
            "\u00a0The course was decent. I wish there had been more discussion of American counterinsurgency strategy and the history of intervention and development aid. ",
            "\u00a0If said student was deeply passionate about ameliorating poverty in conflict zones, then yes. Otherwise, if said student was just looking for an interesting PoliSci class, I would direct them elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I am NOT a global major but I still LOVED going to Prof. Lyall's class. It was entertaining and super interesting to hear it from someone who has been in the field before and is a key player in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anybody interested in international development, security or both. The readings and lectures are amazing and help you to get a remarkably nuanced understanding of a lesser-known subject in international relations. Additionally this class is a great way to learn how to think critically about research and IR theories, which are invaluable skills to delve past surface level explanations of aid and insurgency and engage in critical analysis of these concepts. Stellar class, highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the effects of foreign aid but I wouldnt recommend this course to anyone who does not want to be a political science or global major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially for students who are considering Political Science/Global Affairs but are unsure of their major. I found it to be very relevant, applicable, and interesting. Lecture was engaging, and discussion section was challenging and forced us to demonstrate command of the material. I learned a remarkable amount of material in just a semester, and genuinely plan on using this information later in my career. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. No matter what major a student wants to pursue, this is a fascinating course that, although might fit in the political science and global affairs fields, also include STEM. This is a course that needs scientists and economists alike because humanitarian aid is not limited to the humanities. Different people studying different fields need to know the issues regarding humanitarian aid and work together in order to figure out humanitarian aid that works. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. \r\n\r\nWHY DID YOU DENY JASON LYALL TENURE!? ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is really fun and I learned so much. I would recommend this class if you are interested in political science research or insurgency/civil war. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. "
