            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of knowledge of how to utilize the Japanese language in writing, speaking, and reading. I learned essential communication skills along with grammar, vocabulary, and so much more. ",

            "\u00a0Plenty of Japanese grammar, vocabulary, kanji, and ways of speaking ",
            "\u00a0My memorization skills and speaking skills drastically increased during the course of this class. My confidence in the language also grew since last semester. Additionally, we learned more customs in Japan that may be relevant for students, such as myself, who will be going to Japan to study soon. ",

            "\u00a0I developed basic conversational skills and learned more kanji. ",
            "\u00a0Compared to last semester, I think my understanding of direct style speech improved dramatically. I feel as though now I have a working foundation of the language so much so that I could get around Japan for the most part. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: always great feedback, great teachers\r\n\r\n\r\nCould be improved by cutting down workload and focusing homework on specific topics ",
            "\u00a0The instructions are very detailed, sometimes the assignments are too many ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely well organized and informative. It facilitated learning very well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of practice in many contexts. Speaking in daily classes, writing for the homework, listening assignments, etc. The class size is small, so everyone gets to practice. A really robust introductory course; I learned so much in a short period of time. Also, the professors grade really, really fast, and I really appreciate that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You, as a student, have to stay on top of things because it goes fast. ",
            "\u00a0I think the way it is organized is very well done. Grades are always put in on time and we receive feedback on our work the day after it is handed in. Teachers are always encouraging students to go to office hours and review sessions are regularly held before exams. Lectures usually have a certain theme and heavily engage the class. Having \"Japanese Clinic\" with Japanese students on campus was also very helpful in getting small questions answered that we may not have had the chance to ask the professors.\r\nI wasn't the biggest fan of the textbook because of how formal it made my speech and sometimes phrases are outdated. ",
            "\u00a0At times the course felt fast paced through grammar concepts, and depending on your workload, it could feel like you were struggling to get by day to day rather than working, but the course was well taught, and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves way too rapidly and the flipped classroom makes learning very ineffective. It could benefit from more lecture. ",
            "\u00a0My section was very few in number. This was great because it made the learning environment that much more close. We could ask questions frequently and the small group allowed each of us to work on our own pronunciation and application of the language more and more.\r\nIn my opinion, the course is a bit fast. Specifically, when we are all speaking as a group, sometimes everyone will say different things, and the sensei does not always give a clear answer as to who is grammatically correct and who is not.

            "\u00a0Yes, highly recommend. Japanese department teachers are the best! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good opportunity to get up early everyday and learn the language ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Its a fantastic and rigorous, but rewarding language course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Japanese, for sure. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student! Not only did I feel like I was constantly learning something new but all the professors' dedication and hard work into making the class engaging was a huge part of why the course was so excellent. We learned through various methods and styles but all which was focused on improving each student's comprehension of Japanese and Japanese culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in learning the Japanese language, then do it. The senseis are lots of fun and even though the class moves fast, it just means that you are learning a lot. The assignments are not just one thing, there are listening, reading, speaking, and movie watching homework assignments to assure your well roundedness in the language. ",
            "\u00a0If learning another language interests you, you want a challenge, or want to learn Japanese specifically, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would warn them about the workload and time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is incredible how quickly you learn, and if you put the work in, the payoff is completely worth all the effort. "
