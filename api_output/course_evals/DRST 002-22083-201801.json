            "\u00a0I gained a greater appreciation for the western canon, as well as a greater understanding of how works across the centuries communicate with and influence each other. ",

            "\u00a0I liked that we got to read foundational texts.  At times, though, the reading was very excessive--for example, there is no way that we could possibly talk about 200, even 100, pages of reading for one class. With DS, there is a very fine line between reading enough of a work to truly appreciate it and overwhelming the students with so much reading that there is no way they can be expected to read it all--and most do not read it all. Perhaps a solution would be overall shortened reading assignments or the same assignments with specific emphases on what sections will be focused on in class. I also like the fact that the class was arranged in a seminar fashion to facilitate discussion; I did not like the fact that it seemed that the same people were always dominating this discussion while certain people never got involved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are that we read an immense amount of books while still delving very deeply into each of them. I don't have any suggestions for how it could be improved; it was great! ",
            "\u00a0It's too surface level. Although this is the nature of the course. We simply read too much to actually sink our teeth into any one thing. It at times felt insurmountable to me. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this class was that it moved slightly slowly. The strengths are the material and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is the broad range of texts read. I loved Derek Walcott who isn't always read in the canon. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This is overall a really strong course, and it's main strength is close engagement with the text. The only issue is that some assignments are so long that nobody actually reads the whole thing, which can alienate the reader slightly. ",
            "\u00a0overall, I loved this class so much. \r\nI thought our discussions were great, sometimes it was sad if we moved too slow to get to the ending but I think we got the hang of it by the end. I think maybe it could help if in the beginning of the semester, there was more structure to discussion of each passage and a firm cutoff if we got too stuck on one thing "

            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely! Professor Levin has such a wealth of knowledge about literature and it is amazing to be able to learn from her! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. At the end of the day, this serves as a very robust basis for all western culture. It is worth knowing how the west's heritage has played out in novels. ",
