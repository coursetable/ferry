            "\u00a0I learned how to write. I'm a senior and I've taken 8+ writing credits, but Verlyn taught me how to really write. He also taught me how to listen to my observations and feel that my voice is valid. I learned how to think about writing and reading in new ways, and I improved my prose tremendously. I learned how to edit and I learned that writing can just be writing a sentence or two, not anything dramatic. This class is a gift. I don't know how else to put it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read more carefully and listen to the way writers construct their sentences. I also learned how to write more freely and naturally. ",
            "\u00a0This course is one of the few at Yale to teach a non-specialist writing style. Verlyn doesn't want  his students to write prose that is purely journalistic, academic or creative. He just wants to see clear, uncomplicated writing. This is a goal missing from most other writing-intensive and humanities courses. From this class, I learned that lucid, simple writing is the best way to communicate even the most complex topics. I practiced this writing style in weekly 2-page writing assignments. I have already incorporated this insight and style into my other courses, and I have found it immensely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for people who have previously only written in the context of more formal/academic writing. Verlyn teaches students to pare down their writing, make sentences clearer, and write with intent. One great takeaway the class had this year is that genres are fluid. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you learn how to write steadily, thoughtfully, and slowly. By focusing on the sentence as a unit and a genre, Verlyn strips away all excess processes and turns writing into the simple act of creating and describing ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class was invaluable to both my clarity and confidence as a writer. I got used to writing something for a weekly deadline and getting feedback from an editor. I also read some cool nonfiction and remembered how empowering it can be to write. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write clear sentences and think more deeply about expressing myself in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed much more confidence as a writer. Other courses teach you how to write strong, concise sentences. This course gave me a voice as a writer. I came away from this course feeling like I have something valuable to offer, that I too can add to the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I could write so much in this box here. I could write about how I grew both as a writer and as an individual. Instead, I will try to keep this as brief as possible. I gained the confidence to be bold, to write freely, and to accept constructive criticism. I have never written better and it's thanks to this course. Thanks to the emphasis on sentence level clarity and grammar. The best writing course at Yale. HANDS DOWN. ",
            "\u00a0Verlyn's class is the only one I've ever taken that was about learning to write. This class is about learning to trust yourself as a writer, learning to edit your own work, and learning how to take feedback and grow from it. True to its name, it's a class about sentences: learning to weed out the bad ones, and, by practicing every week, how to write good ones. "

            "\u00a0It's a really wonderful class. Great comraderie, Verlyn is great and extremely supportive of our writing. It's like learning to write again, and it is the best feeling. Go to office hours! \r\n*General note: this class is based in nonfiction and no other genre. Just nonfiction and good sentences. ",
            "\u00a0Verlyn is the biggest strength of the class, and in particular his attitude toward writing is an enormous strength. The seminar is at once relaxed and invigorating, the assignments challenging but not stressful. Office hours were extraordinarily helpful, and it was a true honor to be able to spend fifteen minutes outside of class with Verlyn each week and construct such a strong relationship with a professor. The class has only strengths. I truly can't imagine anything better than this class. \r\nThe only possible weakness I can think of is that a few of the readings felt less conducive to discussion, but I trust Verlyn so much that perhaps I'm wrong about that. ",
            "\u00a0This course is probably the best English creative writing course I have taken at Yale. There is enough reading so that you can analyze other people's work, but you also write a piece every week (I thought the 2-page limit was really nice and didn't put a lot of unnecessary pressure on me). I can't really think of any weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Verlyn is an incredible and dedicated teacher, which is the greatest strength of the course. He makes his office hours schedule clear, and he encourages students to come by every week or two. The assigned readings are great. The workload is very manageable and effective for learning. The classroom conviviality and intimacy is also wonderful, and it promotes positive workshopping experiences.\r\n\r\nI think the incredibly self-directed nature of the assignments (2 pages, no prompt, every week) is an overall strength. However, I think slightly more direction in certain ways could be useful. For instance, sending out short notes on the readings each week (i.e. \"pay particular attention to the use of rhythm in this piece\" or \"note how and when the author's personality enters\") would help students get the most out of the readings. I felt that I could have learned more about the various authors' techniques with guidance like this. Instead, I often felt like I just walked away with an general impression of the pieces (which was positive, since they were all great reads). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Steady format to the class, fair and thoughtful comments, great readings, no pressure to have a \"final project\" \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is sort of a double-edged sword (as it was also helpful in some ways), but do really get a lot out of the class, it was pretty necessary to go to office hours. I think this can be seen as a weakness as someone people don't like learning in that type of context or have schedules that don't allow it. \r\n\r\nSome people may also not like that each week has the same format. Though others will like this consistency. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths had to do with the how the class is taught hands down. 2 pages of writing every week on anything. The fact that no grades were assigned to those pieces made things a lot less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything. The fact that we all as a class give feedback to each writer when its their turn to be workshopped (instead of splitting the class into groups of two like most other writing classes at Yale). The fact that grades are based on the effort we put into the class and our level of improvement rather than how we compare to other students in terms of skill level. Individual assignments are not given grades. And finally...we are never given a prompt. By not being given weekly prompts for our essays, we don't suffer anxiety about how to meet the expectation of the professor. We write freely about what we want to write about. Verlyn gives us agency and gives very thorough individual feedback both through writing and in person at office hours. Amazing class. Most approachable, fair, brilliant english professor I have had at Yale. LET THIS MAN TEACH MORE CLASSES. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything. Verlyn is an incredible teacher whose honesty and presence would be enough to make any class great. The assignment is more or less the same every week: go out and write something. After years of vague English assignments about thematic content and close reading, this class is a godsend. The workshop portion of the class is effective, the office hours are helpful (and in my opinion necessary to get the most out of the class, since you can go over your writing in detail), and the readings for each week are eminently manageable. Plus, the other students in the class! They will be wonderful and you will grow together. "

            "\u00a0This course is such a treat. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0MUST-TAKE. It's truly a shame that only fifteen students can take this course each year. It's the only course at Yale I've taken (I'm a senior) where I learned SO MUCH but never once felt stressed. It's incredible. If you're thinking about applying but worry you're not \"writer\" enough or are concerned you won't get in, APPLY ANYWAY. Verlyn puts together a wonderful mix of people, from creative writing concentrators to science buffs, and you don't have to have extreme \"writing experience.\" Verlyn will change everything you think you know about writing. He'll make you a better writer and a better observer of the world, the greatest gifts I can imagine from a course. I've learned to trust my voice and learned how to write outside of a strict \"writing\" context. My prose improved tremendously. Office hours are also extraordinarily amazing -- it's like a private writing tutoring session each week for 15 minutes with the best writing teacher I've ever had. YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. ",
            "\u00a0If you get into this class, absolutely take it. It will transform the way you view writing and make you a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it if you can get in. The workload is quite light, but your writing improves so much: a perfect combination! Verlyn is really dedicated to helping you clarify and enhance your writing style. He encourages all his students to come to office hours frequently (2-4x/month), and I found these sessions more helpful for improving my writing than the seminar sessions. Seminar was still delightful, however, as I really enjoyed the convivial, intimate and supportive atmosphere that develops amongst the class participants. Both a deeply pleasant and incredibly useful class, with an emphasis on writing styles not found in most of Yale's writing courses. Highly, highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely recommend other students take this class. Verlyn is a really caring teacher, and he does not make you worry about grades or how \"well\" you are doing in the class. He really just wants you to be the best writer you can be, regardless of how other people in the class are doing. Each week, you will go over a reading, some bad sentences plucked from the pieces written that week, and read a few pieces. People will go around commenting on things they liked/wanted improved. It's definitely a very relaxing, open class. Verlyn emphasizes that he doesn't want a certain type of \"voice\" or writing. The one thing he does teach in the beginning of the course though is how to pare down your writing and make very clear sentences full of intent. Later on in the course, writers start to grow off in different directions. Verlyn is very open to helping! One caveat I would say though is that going to office hours is an integral part of getting good feedback on your writing. Even Verlyn admits sometimes he can't read his own handwriting. If you are someone who really doesn't like meeting with a professor one-on-one, this may not be the class for you. Also, there is no final project in the course. So it kind of chugs along with the same pattern until the end of the semester. This is nice because there is no stress to culminate this one final piece, but I think if you are someone who wants a lot of changes/newness each week, this may not be the choice for you.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a very fun and relaxed class. You will become a better, more clear writer. Verlyn definitely cares and is a very interesting person to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT. Verlyn is incredible. He is so generous and thoughtful with his feedback, and he genuinely cares about his students. Go to office hours -- even if they're up on Science Hill. It's such a good weekly check-in. It was so satisfying to watch my writing and that of my peers improve over the course of the semester. You'll stop feeling so scared of writing and start to believe in your own perspective. You'll also end up with lots of good life advice. ",
            "\u00a0If you like writing/want to make your writing better, you need to take this class. It's one of the least stressful classes I've taken at Yale thanks to Verlyn's approach, but it was extremely enjoyable. I loved reading everyone's essays every week. Your writing will improve tremendously. This class will simultaneously make you doubt whether you're a good writer but also feel more confident in your writing as well because Verlyn gives great prep talks. He's easy-going but also blunt in his feedback, so be prepared. I loved this class! ",
            "\u00a0The best writing class I have taken in four years at Yale. Maybe the best class  period. And it's all thanks to Verlyn. Never have I met someone who thinks so deeply about the world and the craft of writing. Every week, I learned something new just from listening to him talk. You must take his class if you get in. It's stress-free just two pages a week   so you can focus entirely on submitting the best work possible. Each week, Verlyn picked 2-3 of our submissions to workshop in class. Take this class, and above all, visit him every week during office hours. You will find your voice as a writer and you will become a better person for it. ",
            "\u00a0See reasons above. \r\n\r\n\r\nYES YES YES. Best writing course at Yale. You will improve, you won't have to follow a prompt, you will be allowed to write from the soul and you will learn the importance of SENTENCE LEVEL CLARITY AND CORRECT GRAMMAR.\r\n\r\nTAKE THIS CLASS. VERLYN WILL PUT THE COURAGE BACK INTO YOUR  HEART NO MATTER WHAT YOUR WRITING LEVEL IS TO BEGIN WITH. You will improve immensely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class without hesitation to students who want to improve their writing and are willing to work hard at it. "
