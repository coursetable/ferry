            "\u00a0I had a great time this semester learning about  global politics through different philosophical theories and sociological tools ",
            "\u00a0I developed my knowledge of the history of currently salient political terms.  Through the readings and class discussions, I felt better able to analyse current political issues and to have more complex opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of the history of key ideas such as liberalism, populism... ",
            "\u00a0The biggest insight I developed is an understanding of many of the terms that are being used to describe the current state if the world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding and appreciation for intellectual history and how current ideas and concepts have evolved and morphed over the course of their existence. The course challenged some of my most basic assumptions about society and has driven me to really understand my answers to fundamental questions around society and existence. ",
            "\u00a0Foundations of political theory and how to have conversations with people who don't share your POV ",
            "\u00a0Connecting theories to the real case study ",
            "\u00a0I had a great time writing the final paper, but I didn't find the classes tremendously useful or skill-building. ",

            "\u00a0I love this seminar style class and the material we cover ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the excellent set of readings and Danny's wide ranging knowledge.  The weakness was the level of class discussion - I think it would be helpful to have a little more structure next year to make sure that students do the readings and that students presenting know what the expectations on them are. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe content of this course is fascinating. The readings are generally very interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis course has very little structure and feels improvised. While the readings apply these big ideas to specific contexts and cases, the lecture and discussion are too high level and make it difficult to really talk about anything specific. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness of the course is its breadth. The topic of History of the Present is board so it is impossible to go into great detail on any one topic, even if there would be a semester's worth of information in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were excellent but the conversations could have stood to be improved. I think much of that rested on the fact that this was a required course that a significant portion of the class did not appreciate. I think dropping the class presentation and instead pushing weekly reading responses may have helped students do more of the readings and engage in conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I felt this course had huge potential for being the source of an intellectual renaissance. Unfortunately, I thought the lack of structure and clear objectives undermined our ability to connect predicates and formulate deep ideas on the topics. ",
            "\u00a0This class, from what I've heard, is way better than when Tim Snyder taught it.  So the positive elements of this class should be kept around for next year regardless of who teaches it.  These positives would include having the class focus on worldwide topics (not just US/Europe) and not doing simulations.  However, this class had weaknesses too.  It was too big to be the seminar style that was intended.  And it was broken up so weirdly.  To have students present for half an hour, and then have Danny cut in and give a half-hour monologue where he often read to us verbatim a paper he was about to publish, felt useless.  If I wanted to read the paper, I'd just read it when it came out.  Class time should be back-and-forth discussion and feedback, not just monologues.  What discussion time we did have left after all of that was just people injecting thoughts but didn't really flow because there were too many people to make it a real conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how open the discussion was, but it was limited by poor engagement by many class members. I think this could be improved if laptops were banned from the class as it would encourage people to engage more and remove a physical barrier that shields people from engagement.\r\n\r\nI also didn't think that the instructor facilitated the weekly student presentations in the best way. More emphasis and flexibility for the students would help everyone get more out of this part of the class. "

            "\u00a0I would love to recommend this course as a great way to expand one's knowledge regarding politics not just in the US but in the world and to analyze different sociopolitical trends. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is generally interested in politics and history. ",
            "\u00a0No. While the readings are fascinating, this course is unstructured and unlikely to stimulate engaging conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend for anyone struggling to understand our current moment. ",
            "\u00a0I would if the class develops more structure and if lectures are planned out to include very specific themes and takeaways beyond just having students participate in a circular fire squad opining on the readings. "
