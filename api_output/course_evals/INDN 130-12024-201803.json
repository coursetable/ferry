            "\u00a0Some usage of indonesian ",
            "\u00a0- I did not learn any new Indonesian this semester ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about vocabulary, grammar, and culture in this class. Of course, it builds on L1 and L2, and it's very much a continuation of that in all aspects. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the Indonesian culture during this class as well as my reading and speaking ability. "

            "\u00a0Bu Dinny is flexible and tries to engage with culture and language in different ways.   She is good at ensuring that everyone in the class participates and creates a comfortable environment\r\n\r\nHowever, the classroom is often disorganized.  Canvas is not really used. Assignments are often mentioned as the class is leaving, due dates are flexible but also unclear, scope of assignments is also unclear.  Its just confusing to try to figure out what we are supposed to learn. Sometimes we go weeks without an assignment and then we get one day to finish an assignment that is bigger than anything else we have ever done.  Its just impossible to plan how to study for this class.  Also, the teacher has no control over the classroom.  There are days when four different conversations are going on while the teacher is talking.  Leading up to the last  test, we spent a class watching a movie, talking about mixed drinks from indonesia and not really reviewing for the test at all.  She also makes fun of students in ways that are not appropriate - one student was consistently teased for being \"single\".  I wish the class was taken more seriously by the class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses:\r\n- Dinny is unprofessional and unhelpful. She is terrible at explaining concepts and does not understand how to manage a class. Students do not respect her and she has no interest in teaching the material. I would strongly advise not taking this course if she is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0It's very interactive. For example, we have speakings every Thursday to work on our speaking skills. We also had a visit from an Indonesian princess who taught us about culture and life in her palace. What could be improved is that the tests were all really long :( ",
            "\u00a0I see no weaknesses. I like how you have a nobrol-nobrol every week to make it a more normal experience. "

            "\u00a0only under some circumstances ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend not taking this course. Dinny is the worst teacher I have had at Yale by far. Grades in the course are not based on a rubric and she gives out grades based on how she feels about students at the end of the semester. I asked her multiple times where I stood in the course and she did not tell me. On multiple occasions, I asked her what percentage tests, homework, and other assignments were weighted and she gave me different percentages each time.\r\n\r\nShe is very bad at explaining Indonesian grammar. Students have to ask her several times to re-explain concepts, because she truly struggles with teaching. Most of class time is wasted and she comes to class with no lesson plan and simply has us have random, group conversations or watch a video. Dinny is also very unwilling to help. I and everyone else in the course has, at some point, asked a vocab question and she has told us to go use Google Translate.\r\n\r\nThe dates for tests are unknown at the beginning of the semester and will be decided on a weekly basis. Canvas will hardly be used and there will be little communication in the course about assignments and office hours. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the Indonesian language and culture is so interesting, and there really isn't another opportunity to learn about it. It's so much fun and overall an amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great opportunity to make friends who you wouldn't meet otherwise. An easier language to learn than others at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class!! Bu Dinny is the best! "
