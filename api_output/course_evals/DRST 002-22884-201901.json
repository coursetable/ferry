            "\u00a0My writing improved, as did my ability to read and analyze a variety of texts. ",
            "\u00a0I think that my paper understanding of myself as a paper-writing human really developed. I also think that this course allowed me to better understand the trajectory of literature in the Western Canon in general, and in doing so has given me the skills to unlock literature I read in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I am so much happier with my academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Deep, critical reading and writing, stylistic evaluation, how to write an argumentative, academic paper, understanding of the literary core of the Western Canon ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in writing and literary analysis. The broad-based content of the course allowed me to develop a better understanding of important themes in literature since the Renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I gained many skills to improve my writing through the quality and quantity of feedback I received both in the margins of my papers and in office hour meetings. I also developed an attention to and a recognition of the structure and form of a literary work as a source of meaning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do close reading - even though DS doesn't let you delve into any one text in depth, you can still learn so much by delving into specific passages. I also learned how to contextualise and read literature - it never really occurred to me that it was particularly important to know the personal histories of the various authors, but the media and the biographies that we did this semester was unexpectedly helpful in understanding the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The ways in which this course opened my eyes to the modern era of literature was one of the most valuable academic experiences I have had. I felt I was both challenged and supported in developing my writing style and immensely enjoyed the discussions we had in seminar. I looked forward to this class every week and was often in awe at the way my professor delved deeply into select portions of the text and changed my understanding of the novel. ",
            "\u00a0I understood much better the ways I could begin to improve in my writing, specifically in the types of arguments I make and the structure of them. ",
            "\u00a0Argumentation, writing skills, literature analysis, section participation, close reading "

            "\u00a0The course was wonderful! The texts were all enjoyable and valuable to read, and the chronological structure enhanced our study go them. I find that the greatest challenge with DS is how little time can be devoted to each book, but, despite the time limitations, I found that we were able to achieve a degree of both breadth and depth in our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging, proper balance of student discussion and teacher led evaluation, loved going through bits if text during class for deep readings, openers were helpful in making a roadmap to understand the work ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is well designed as it gave me an understanding of the continuity and reflexivity of western Literature across time. Themes that appeared early in the semester (or even last semester) were constantly revisited and given new interpretation and meaning, allowing us to make comparisons and connections across time. Many lectures were incredibly well delivered, and discussions in sections were also very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of the literature section of the DS program is its curriculum. The books read and the order in which they are read makes for a very cohesive semester that seems to build upon itself. Last semester, the books seemed even more cohesive as if we were following the themes and motifs of nostos, kleos, epic traditions, etc... But, this semester though we were essential doing the same thing, I felt like we talked about it less. I think the DS program could be improved by adding more of a thematic element to its curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the selection of texts this semester - it was incredibly interesting and I especially liked the inclusion of postcolonial reactions to the Western canon because it engaged with the Western canon in a critical but constructive way. I also felt that the lectures were really enlightening and provided great overviews on the author, context, and interesting arguments that helped ground seminars. One thing I would have appreciated was for there to be more background on the different literary movements across the centuries. ",
            "\u00a0I seriously enjoyed the structure of the class - I thought it was fantastic to have bios of the authors at the start of seminar to help put the works into context and then listen to one of my peers' prepared starters. Almost every work spoke to me in a different way and though I wish we could have spent more time on certain books, I know this is the nature of Directed Studies and I'm excited to go back to many of them throughout my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Slanski does an outstanding job in so many ways, but I found her instructions on how to improve my writing particularly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course was overall very strong. I felt that some of the lectures could have been more engaging or relevant towards the course material. I also felt that the syllabus could be reworked, especially so that an additional female author, i.e. Jane Austen, could be incorporated into the syllabus. However, I felt that the course was well rounded and offered a very deep insight into the study of the Western canon that I will be sure to carry with me for the rest of my time at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would! It was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far, and many of the books we read were among my favorites of DS. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely to someone who enjoyed DS first semester. Second semester Literature gets even more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wants to cover a core selection of literary masterpieces within the Western tradition, knowing that it will be challenging, fast paced, and less thorough than a semester long course of a single text ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, as I think it has helped me develop a broader perspective of Literature, especially its development towards modernity. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The literary section of DS has been my favorite and has kept me loving reading even when the philosophy and H&P readings occasionally bog me down. I think most of us left our first year at Yale with lists of what we hope to read this summer full of the other works of the authors we read for class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0It's still very reading intensive,  and I think you could probably learn similar close reading skills from other literature courses (especially if you're already interested in a specific type of literature/specific time period). As it stands,  it introduced me to writers that I wouldn't have sought out otherwise, and even the texts that I did not enjoy taught me a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they truly love to read great books. If they don't have that passion, then I think the volume of the reading would be too overwhelming. "
