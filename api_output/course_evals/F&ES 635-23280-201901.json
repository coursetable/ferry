",

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing instruction, well organized, expectations clear, strong feedback on assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3-hour lecture once a week is just not an ideal format. Professor Gross certainly made the best of it, but it's impossible not to lose some focus and take away less in the latter parts of each lecture. ",

I do not intend to use Excel as a daily tool at my job but it was a great way to learn the material and how project finance concepts work in real life. I think Professor Gross was effective at conveying how practitioners might use these skills and how they might be further complicated in practice. Also, the TFs were generally very helpful.\r\n\r\nI was personally not a fan of some of the more TED Talk style lectures. It all felt a little silly. As someone who is actually interested in the save the world side of the class (that is, I did not join just to bolster my modeling experience), some of those rah-rah moments were seriously cringe-worthy. Maybe they were just meant as mental breaks from the harder material. But there has to be a better way. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging lectures with real-world examples and a very practical skillset. The recitations were extremely helpful too.\r\nWeaknesses: It's probably more manageable with a smaller class because office hours could get crazy and there is not as much opportunity for one-on-one catching up on the material. Also, I imagine the TAs would have left more detailed comments on HW if they hadn't had as many assignments to grade. ",

            "\u00a0The course is incredibly effective at building skills from zero to 100. Most students enter the class with barely any understanding of financial modeling, and they come away with the ability to build a complex financial model. A weakness of the course is the format itself - it is difficult to maintain attention spans for 3 hour lectures. At times, the lectures felt like they were all over the place - the timing and logic of when we are taught certain concepts could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course overall, I wish we didn't have a group project though ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well organized and has many resources. It could improve by having shorter lecture time and more optional readings or lecture slides ",
            "\u00a0Very good timing and everything that's important in the real world is covered. In class, demos were very helpful and there should be more of them especially in the third part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is that the high level of engagement and challenging assignments force you to actually learn and get comfortable with building financial models and synthesizing difficult contracts. I am not sure I would call this a weakness, but the course is extremely challenging and the playing field is not level as some people are very familiar with financial modeling. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Uses real-life case and walks you through it. \r\nWeaknesses: Not sure I could replicate what I did in the end plus I spent a lot of time reading legal documents that were way too long and complicated so didn't take much from them. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs are very knowledgeable but only now what they have seen in class for the most part so they don't really understand really well outside of that ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dan Gross himself and the way the whole class has been designed with focus on both the modelling and the project documents. The use of all that we had learned over the semester on the final model was very helpful too.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The recitation sessions could have been improved and the TAs could have been more flexible with identifying the best practices of modelling. Because I dont think there can just be one template of best practices across the whole industry. ",
            "\u00a0you harvest what you sow ",
            "\u00a0It is very clear that Dan Gross has put in a huge amount of time and consideration to make the class as useful as possible for students who are coming from different backgrounds and will go on to work in different aspects of the clean energy space. It was great to have the chance to dive deep into both the contracts side of project finance and the financial modeling to get a good sense of how the work is done overall. I also really enjoyed the latter parts of the class where we applied project finance tools to other issues beyond just renewable energy. I think one thing to improve might be the recitations. There were some big discrepancies in terms of quality of those presentations among the TAs, and sometimes it seemed like a lot of time put in for not much gained. ",
            "\u00a0Keep Dan Gross as the lecturer. Continue to keep a high number of TA's \r\nMake the recordings available for permanent download. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of the course (no fault to Professor Gross) is that there are so many people at different skill levels, it becomes challenging to stay engaging to those who have prior knowledge of excel or the technical details. Strength of the class is that Dan is constantly modifying it to make sure people are learning what they need to learn. ",
            "\u00a01. Students need more preparation before the first assignment. While learning on our own is valuable under many circumstances, in this case we would have learned more with a bit of additional help and guidance.\r\n2. The delays in posting recitation videos created a real challenge for students unable to attend some of the recitations in person. If SOM IT will not post them quickly, an alternative site for recitations (FES) should be used in the future.\r\n3. The basic final model should include periodicity. It would still be considerably easier than the advanced model, but ensure that all students finish the course with a fuller understanding. The enhanced model was too long. Pairing back a few of the less important options would allow students to focus on the more critical advanced skills without reducing the amount they learn in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Well structured and organized. The fast pace and heavy material content made it hard to keep up with the class. I was unable to digest learnings from one section before we were on to the next. "

The Sunday deadlines are difficult if you don't start the assignments early in the week because for seniors, lots of events start happening Sunday nights in the spring semester, so if you have the opportunity to take it as a junior, then do that. The TAs are willing to help, Dan is a fantastic lecturer, and the assignments are really interesting if you want to know more about how to actually make a wind project happen. In this class, I learned way more about the mechanics behind wind than in any other undergraduate class, who's scope on renewable energy is either an introductory EVST class or an advanced Electrical Engineering class. It's really fun to learn the skill of financial modeling because it's useful for life and any energy or finance related job. ",
