            "\u00a0I was exposed to French literature, more complex grammar structures, and difficult vocabulary. ",

            "\u00a0I learned more about the basic grammar skills of French, and my ability to read French improved greatly due to the number of books we read. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper knowledge of many different types of French grammatical systems and how to use them in daily conversations. I also greatly broadened my vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more french and became a lot more confident conversing and writing in the language. ",

            "\u00a0I like the methods of integrating and learning. More one on one learning of how to speak and answer questions that are not related to the coursework would be great-- I doubt I have to talk about the characters of Jules et Jim to someone from Paris. Also the work sometimes felt like busywork and took much longer than necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material could sometimes be a bit boring and I did not always feel engaged by what we were learning. At times, it also felt a bit basic.\r\n\r\nI liked the texts that we looked at and found it interesting how all of these materials were woven together throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course did not have a lot of weaknesses in my opinion. It was very well organized and facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like those who studied abroad before this class or placed into it as freshman were way ahead of those who took 120, and it just wasnt great to see that large of a difference everyday in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely well organized, great books and movies, and I greatly benefited from the nightly homework assignments that included written, spoken, and listening practice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of! Definitely requires quite a bit of work, but absolutely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was great, but some of the movies we watched weren't very engaging for me such as Jules et Jim. "
