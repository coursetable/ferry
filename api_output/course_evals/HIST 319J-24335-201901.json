            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about Tokugawa Japan, which I didnt previously know about ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Japan during this period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think comparatively across time and space, about Japanese culture, and how to hone my writing skills (Professor Drixler provided very good feedback!). ",
            "\u00a01. The difference between descriptive and prescriptive historical texts \r\n2. A clearer understanding of comparative history between Tokugawa Japan and other time periods in world history\r\n3. That I am incredibly interested in the time period and would like to take another class on this historical period\r\n4. How to craft papers with stronger theses "

        [
            "\u00a0I liked this course more at the beginning than at the end. Prof Drixler didnt make his expectations clear, but definitely had things in mind that he wanted from us. He was very vague with the guidelines and changed the assignments on the syllabus at two different points throughout the semester, which was confusing. There were no clear guidelines for assignments but then he had very harsh criticism at times about what he didnt like in a paper. How would we know what to do without any guidelines other than a short paper responding to the weeks readings? ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. The way it approaches history and the way the syllabus is structured are fantastic. I wish we had spent maybe half an hour at the very beginning talking about the history of the Edo Period instead of just being told what to read as background, as I did not have much background in the history of the period before this class, but that resolved itself quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor and his engagement, the students in the course, the general weekly topics,  the papers, the readings\r\nWeaknesses: overall, I really enjoyed the class, but sometimes I felt that our discussions were a little tangential/we would focus on a limited number of topics for the entire class period (sometimes it would have been nice to transition to other topics more quickly) ",
            "\u00a0Professor Drixler is wonderful. The approach of the class was really unique and a fascinating way to think about history. ",
            "\u00a0The tragic point about a cultural class is that it oftentimes delves too much into abstract concepts. I'd much rather prefer Professor Drixler drive the class more towards the text rather than concepts that some of us weren't entirely familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting readings, engaging professor, great classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought it was an unrealistic amount of reading, Drixler frequently went off on tangents so seminar was never very streamlined or focused, and I thought that it was clear who his favorites were "

            "\u00a0You will definitely learn a lot and Prof Drixler definitely cares about the class, but he could be really brutal to people in his comments in class and on papers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a fantastic course and I loved every minute of it ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! Especially if you do not have much background in Japanese/early modern history. It was a great opportunity to draw comparisons between other times and places, and Professor Drixler always asks thought-provoking questions. We also touched on several themes in cultural history, which kept the course material fresh and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A must take. Professor Drixler is a professor you have to benefit from as a Yale student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Drixler is really thoughtful and passionate about Tokugawa Japan. He has a lot of knowledge to share, but is also really good at guiding students to finding answers on their own. He is great at leading seminar and asks great questions. ",
            "\u00a0It would depend how interested the student is in learning about this time period and how much prior information they have before joining the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Prof. Drixler is the real deal - a historian who is really committed to teaching you the discipline of history, not just giving you information. Discussions every week were fantastic. "
