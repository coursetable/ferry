            "\u00a0Strengths: professors, small class, personalized attention \r\nWeakness: quizzes sometimes tripped us up, boundaries for grades are not that clear (i.e what makes a B+ vs. A-) \r\n\r\nImprovements: There should be an additional lab course that goes along with the Biology sequence because not all first-years coming into college know how to read a protein band. That's certainly not taught in underfunded high schools across the nation and for the biology department to think that students know about lab techniques is truly not helpful to its students. I think methods about how we understand biology knowledge should be emphasized more. "
