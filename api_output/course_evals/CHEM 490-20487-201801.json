            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to conduct scientific research properly, how to present research to peers, and how to write a scientific report. ",
            "\u00a0Working in a research lab is more informative than any course could be. It's all good to be able to write a reaction on paper, but in order to do actual chemistry, you need to know how to set up a reaction in the hood yourself, be able to troubleshoot and think of ways to work around problems as you encounter them. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of the scientific method, detailed data analysis and experimental troubleshooting, ability to describe research purpose and results in a compelling and concise manner ",

            "\u00a0The CHEM490 course provided a platform to explore independent research in the modern chemistry laboratory. During the two semester sequence, I focused on developing skills necessary for independent research, including project design and methodology, literature review, technical skills to carry out experiments, data analysis, and presentation of results in the form of a paper and poster presentation. The course also provided the opportunity to delve deeply into one small area of chemistry research much further than any course in the chemistry department does. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that you get to experience academic research firsthand, and have a facilitated environment in which you can practice talking about your research to other students.\r\nThe weaknesses of it are that you can only get one credit, no matter how much research you do. In MCDB, there is an option to do \"intensive research\" and get 2 credits per semester. I put in way more than 1 credit's worth of work into research both semesters I took Chem 490, which made it hard to do well in the other classes I had to take in order to reach 36 credits and graduate.

            "\u00a0It was great to hear about the work of other students in my year of the chemistry major. However, meeting for 30-45 min every week at an inconvenient time could be avoided by having just two-three meetings during the semester with more presentations per meeting. ",
            "\u00a0There could've been more standardization of expectations across students in different labs - it seemed like 10 hours/week meant very different things and was very differently enforced by different PIs. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on your lab selection. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely. Engaging research and presenting it, fielding questions, is a valuable skill that I was able to practice. ",
            "\u00a0Very relaxed senior requirement. The only thing you do is listen to other students' research presentations. The thesis at the end is just as long as you need it to be to get your point across, and the poster session is very chill. ",
