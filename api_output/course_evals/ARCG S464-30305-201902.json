            "\u00a0Learning all of the anatomy before class then applying that knowledge to the physical bones. was a great way of studying and really helped me succeed ",
            "\u00a0I improved my anatomy skills but also discovered that to do well in osteology, you would most likely need strong memorization skills. I was able to learn much about each bone and the muscles that interact with them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about bones and the different parts of bones. ",
            "\u00a0I am now very knowledgeable about the human body and the bones within it. I found this skill will be very useful throughout my life as it is a very important subject to understand. ",
            "\u00a0First, I developed a detailed understanding of human bone structures and notable features on the bones. Second, I learned how to properly handle human remains. Learning how to sex and age a skeleton (and how to identify its ancestry, to an extent) was probably the most valuable and useful piece of knowledge I've gained, but learning about teeth and bones that form the skull was also interesting. Furthermore, there's the basic knowledge about bones, about how they form, how they reform, and how they change with respect to soft tissues. Finally, I gained insight into how human skeletons fit into the greater hominid evolution. ",

            "\u00a0The course was great! Only weakness would probably be the graduate student helping, many of the students thought that she did not know a lot. ",
            "\u00a0As it was a 3 hour and 15-minute class, most people were mentally tired after 2 hours, which led to less productivity. It might be better if the class was spread out more throughout the week. \r\n\r\nWe were able to study using real specimen in class and had access to our own plastic skeleton for studying at home. We also were able to see a cadaver that helped better our understanding of the muscles that attach to each bone. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is the setup of the class allowing us to study all the bones. The major weakness of the course is that it was not suited to a summer schedule. By this, I mean that there was not enough time at home to learn all the bones before going to class, because we would have only a few days, compared to a full week during the school year. If you were a Yale student and not a high schooler, you were almost certainly doing other things outside of class, like a job, making this class difficult to succeed in. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was that we were given a lot of lab time which helped with studying and preparing for test. The weakness of the class was that is was that your grade was entirely based on exams rather than incorporating other ways to keep your grade high in the class. A bit of diversity with the grading scale would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course would be the amount of hands-on experience this course provided (in the form of real human skeletal remains, the plastic skeleton for every student, and the cadaver), and also the knowledgable and approachable professor and TA. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the classes very much. But because of the amount of memorization required and the unfamiliar technical jargon required to understand them, it might be useful for the syllabus to mention the required reading long before the first class, and if possible, to provide a link to the required chapters (because for me, the textbook wasn't available until I arrived at New Haven and pick it up the day before class starts). It is almost impossible to understand the descriptions for the bones before learning about terms such as anterior and foramen. There also wasn't any revision of materials learned in previous weeks, although that might be because of the condensed schedule of the summer session. As a result, I had forgotten many of the materials learned in my first week by the time the course was finished. In addition, the compact schedule of the summer session and the amount of information I had to remember would lead me to skim part of the material, which lead me to develop a not-so-deep understanding of certain bones and the soft tissues that attached to them. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: course load, professors + TA, use of real specimens\r\n\r\nWeakness: N/A ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the way of delivering the course is impressive\r\nweakness: finishing all the lectures and experiments within 5 weeks is a little bit hard for me, especially I am not English-native speaker. If professor can rearrange the time table for summer session, it can be better for international students for haven't learnt any related subjects before. ",
            "\u00a0Flipped classroom kinda sucks, but its necessary for the shorter summer terms. ",
            "\u00a0Being able to have a hands-on experience about the subject is the strength. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great human specimens \r\nweaknesses: maybe a little too free form ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the amazing help and guidance of professors and the large collection of resources available to aid my education. Weaknesses include the lack of understanding how to parts of the body may function together, this could be improved by more in depth lectures in class. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot to take in in just 5 weeks, but the material has to be covered, so that cannot really be changed. It was very nice to have taken an anatomy course prior. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn all the bones in the body\r\nWeaknesses: straight memorization, no synthesis of information (i.e. no actual \"thinking\"), just straight memorization. Also, we did not practice on fragmented bones (which were tested), we only practiced on whole bones ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is great resources Yale has. I couldn't imagine I can use real human bones in the course. Another is professional faculty. I was really impressed by the professor, who knows every specimen we used and features of each specimen. ",
            "\u00a0it's a lab class, you can go into the lab and see the real spicemen. It's very cool and it helps you to learn well. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. However, only if they enjoy anatomy, anthropology, or have a good memory. If they don't, I believe the other student would think this class is boring and hard. ",
            "\u00a0Ultimately, no. There was not enough time in the summer if you had any outside responsibilities, like a job. The first quiz in particularly was really hard, and since there appears to be no curve on the class, it made it very stressful for the rest of the quizzes. I regret taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as I really enjoyed my time in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, but only if they are well suited to a great deal of memorization and find human skeleton interesting. The instructor is friendly, the resources that Yale could provide for this course is plentiful, and the knowledge learned is compact and fascinating. If they are studying Biological Anthropology and are willing to study Human Osteology, I would definitely recommend them to take this course taught by Professor Sargis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to be a doctor or just curious about human bones take this course! The professor and TA are very supportive in making sure you are learning the content. Also, its quite an experience to handle real human bones. ",
