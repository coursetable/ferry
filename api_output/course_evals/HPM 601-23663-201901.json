            "\u00a0Interesting course. I definitely learned a lot about topics I never considered. However, this course was not what I expected. I would have appreciated more content on how to actually communicate science as opposed to how to study science communication. Several concepts are covered much more in depth than necessary, making some readings and responses quite onerous. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course would provide insight into ways scientists can most effectively communicate their research to the public at large, but this did not pan out throughout the course.  While the material was interesting, I found that the same conversations were more or less happening every week about halfway into the semester.  By the end, it seemed to just be a course highlighting all the ways people can be divided on topics, without any real insight about what to do about it. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting presentation of a new field of science that I had not had exposure to before.  I appreciated our discussions of the HPV vaccine and evolution and their relationship to the science communication environment.  However, I do wish we had spent some time on less controversial topics, or those where there is not yet a communication environment to be \"polluted.\"  I had expected to learn more about science communication of a range of topics, and we spent our time primarily on the most controversial aspects of science.  Additionally, I found that the readings became rather repetitive early on in the course.  This is an emerging field, so there is not really a diverse literature base to pull from, but I found myself getting frustrated at times when we would read articles/studies with the same conclusions or the same study designs as the weeks before.  Overall, this was an interesting class, and I did learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not what I expected it to be in the way it was conveyed early on. I think if it was explained that the course was aimed at looking at study design and empirics and how that reflects into the science of science communication, it wouldve better set the tone for the class. It became tedious to continue to read the influx of articles without much more being understood from it. Class felt to be a little repetitive and couldve expanded its reach in terms of what topics to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Outstanding course.\r\nStrengths:\r\n1. Hands-down the course with the most careful readings and analyses of theoretical arguments and experiments.\r\n2. Students from multiple backgrounds (YSPH, FES, Law, Political Science, etc.).\r\n3. Carefully chosen readings.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is regarding the readings. Because students are coming from such varied backgrounds, I would suggest some additional discussions early on in the semester (later discussions that overlap may need to be sacrificed) to explore the following topics:\r\n1a. How does scientific knowledge (experimentation) differ from non-scientific knowledge. Can we distinguish knowledge from belief?  This would expand on the current readings by Dewey and Popper. Maybe Peirce? Kuhn? Latour? Something that dovetails well...\r\n2. Grid & group theory (e.g. Douglas & Wildavsky's Risk & Culture; Ian Hacking's commentaries; critiques)\r\n3. The roles of science in society, (e.g. Technocracy and Democracy in the Sunstein & Kahan's back-and-forth, maybe Vannevar Bush's Science: The Endless Frontier) ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely expanded and enhanced my attitudes and perspectives on this topic. I really had no idea what to expect when I began taking the class, but the course (and instructor's) strength is enabling students to think about this topic in ways that they may have never done so previously. I was not aware that this discipline existed in the way it does, and I'm grateful for now having this perspective. I also think a strength is the focus on methods - the course / professor were highly critical on the methods of the studies we reviewed and that is a great skill to have. \r\n\r\nA weakness was - at times - it was a bit scattered and unorganized. Sometimes it seemed like there was no real progression, but other times it did. Maybe it was just hard for me to realize/understand. ",
            "\u00a0This course is on a subject matter that is rare to find. It combines several modes of thinking and tackles very fraught issues with scientific rigor. The discussions were interesting, although I think some variation in style was needed. It was always a very open discussion, but some organization might have been helpful for those who are not quick to chime in. ",
            "\u00a0It was more of an applied psychology course than I realized, but I still thought it was interesting. Readings could be a little dense and long at times. Sometimes classes could feel repetitive because we often hit on the same points in multiple classes. The class was the most interesting when we were doing specific case studies of science communication issues. "

            "\u00a0Very smart professor with a lot of interesting ideas. Would have appreciated more feedback on ideas and reading responses in order to gauge how students were understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Dan is clearly a highly intelligent man but I would've appreciated the course more if he focused not only on controversial areas, but areas where science communication was effective for nearly the entire audience. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kahan is very passionate about this topic.  He presents his ideas in an engaging, if sometimes winding, manner.  Sometimes I found myself lost in a question because it kept evolving so much, but he is very thorough with presenting his thought process. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic. Super engaged and immersed in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kahan is an expert in his field and his experiences (and current work) are really fascinating for anyone interested in this topic. Sometimes at the beginning of class, he did a bit too much of a preamble, and it would have been nice to intersperse the lecture throughout the discussion. I really enjoyed his teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Dan is an extremely intelligent and well-respected professor. He goes beyond many professors in his expectations for accuracy and analysis which I appreciated because it felt more real-world, in a sense. What he points out as important is something that might be missed or glossed over by other professors. \r\nHowever, sometimes he talks for too long such that the thread of conversation is a bit too winding and it is harder for others to participate.  He also sometimes asks questions that are too easy to be interesting enough to start a conversation.  The questions he puts to the class could perhaps be better prepared. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Kahan was very open in office hours and brought up some interesting points in class. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in the psychology of science communication and comprehension. If you want to be a better science communicator yourself, I would avoid this class. ",
            "\u00a0The insights you gain from the first 3 week of class is all you're going to learn for the remainder of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would tentatively recommend this course to another student.  I would make sure they know that this is a course studying the science of science communication, not science communication itself (i.e., it is much more than learning how to communicate science to others).  The weekly readings are extensive and can be time-consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Outstanding class exploring the current state of science communication and potential strategies going forward. \r\n\r\nThe class is so interesting that I seem to bring up the subject matter at almost every opportunity I have. ",
            "\u00a0This course will definitely open you up to a new way of thinking about science of science communication, unless you are already an expert in that field that is. I would recommend it for any student willing to think critically throughout the semester about current policy-relevant topics through the lens of this field's research. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in real-world applications of scientific knowledge, then understanding the science of science communication is important. This class will change the way you approach communication skills.  It will also deepen you understanding of study construction and become a more intelligent study reader.  If you are looking for specific communication skills, this will not necessarily grant you that.  But if you want a good place to start, I think this is it. "
