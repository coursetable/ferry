            "\u00a0This course is a rare gem. If you have ever wondered about how context gives language meaning, please take this course. The course explores how this phenomenon happens with a rigor that Professor Horn generously provides. \r\n\r\nTake a look at the syllabus and see if a couple of the readings stand out. If some do, it is pretty much guaranteed you will enjoy most of the other readings you might not have heard of before. The workload is also entirely reasonableweekly readings, 3 p-sets, one low-key presentation and a final paper. "
