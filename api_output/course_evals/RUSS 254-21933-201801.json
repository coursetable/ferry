            "\u00a0I read great books and learned about some crucial distinctions between Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I gained a deep understanding of the biographical lives of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, a relevant history of 19th Century Russia, and, obviously, of many of their works. The class explores how the authors and their works relate to themes of modernization, class, religion, space, morality, lineage, and love. I learned quite a bit about myself through the course, defined by my feelings about the stances of each author in the aforementioned matters. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history and culture in which Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were writing. ",
            "\u00a0I had never broached Russian literature in this way, and Professor Brunson is an amazing Professor for a sophisticated introduction into the canon. I certainly honed my close reading skills and gained more insight into writing about literature comparatively ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about foundational texts in the Russian canon. I was able to connect the 20th century literature I'm already more familiar with with eighteenth century, and it was great to see the connections. I gained a very comprehensive, general view of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky--both their works and their personalities. ",
            "\u00a0In this course we read two incredible novels and a couple of shorter ones too. I think the major things I gained from the course were related to the two big novels we read, and skills related to what to look for in 19th century Russian novels based on the historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthened my ability to read closely, deep appreciation for the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky ",
            "\u00a0My essay writing skills definitely improved by taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course has put me in a position where I can read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with a lot more context. The lectures and sections explored many themes, such as religion, history, philosophy, and modernity, which are crucial to understand the issues that the Russian writer were grappling with. This allowed me to appreciate and think critically about these great works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about reading and interpreting literature and about Russian culture and history. I had the opportunity to hone my writing and speaking skills. "

            "\u00a0Great reading list. The weakness was the lectures, from which I got very little. Prof. Brunson analyzed the books alongside external sources (i.e. historical info, letters/diaries Tolstoy or Dostoevsky had written etc.). By doing this, she rarely looked at internal consistency within a work. There was not a lot of close reading -- looking for clues in the book to help understand other parts of the book. She also didn't generally have strong arguments about a book's arguments; instead she would present a bunch of options about ways to interpret. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brunson is a fantastic lecturer and exceptional as a mentor/educator-- harder to find at Yale than one would think. Each class felt like story-time; the TAs played an active role in class as well as section, the papers were open-ended and fun, the final exam was very fair, and the field trip to the farm was a great time! I thoroughly enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great, would recommend to anyone who's new to Russian literature. It is for beginners and doesn't presume prior knowledge. You learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were being approachable for students not familiar with the Russian canon. It's a great introduction some seminal texts of the Russian canon. No real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list was very manageable, and I was grateful we only read two long novels by these two authors. I thought perhaps we focused a little too much on the early work of the authors (which is just worse) at the beginning of the term, but other than that, the reading list was well-structured. The truth is the books are just hard to teach in a lecture format and I think this class would work much better as a seminar. Section was infinitely more fulfilling for me than lecture was because I was able to share my own ideas about the text, which I think is particularly important for the books we read this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was AMAZING!!! The small-lecture plus section style was perfect and kept me engaged, the readings were unforgettable, the TFs are all wonderful, and Professor Brunson is a force of nature! There is a fair amount of reading, but it's manageable if you stay organized. There are only two papers and one exam. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brunson's class was well organized and the workload is very manageable for a literature class. Her lectures were always incredible. Seriously. All of them were insightful, well-thought out, and even fun to listen to. Professor Brunson's lectures were the \"treats\" I looked forward to on days where I had four classes and hers was the last one. I really liked how section was only a handful of people as I thought that allowed for more engaging discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think halfway through the lectures-section reading pace was disrupted due to Professor Molly's illness, and it made sections quite lost. We should probably stick closer to the intended lecture-section pace. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course with great teaching! Lectures were always beautiful and fascinating, assignments were evaluated in a helpful way with extensive comments, and discussions were enlightening. "

        [
            "\u00a0Not particularly. If you want an excuse to read this books, then yes. But I didn't get that much more out of them by taking them in the context of this class, because the lectures weren't particularly deep or rich. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in slowing down their pace-- this class was both a way to satisfy my long dormant love of literature and a way to ground me in important life lessons every week. Going to class was almost therapeutic. Of course, having some inkling of interest in literature is important, too! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's the best course I've taken in college so far. The readings were manageable if you kept up with it and the once a week response was helpful with that. I managed to read all of the texts on the syllabus, and they were a great set of readings! Prof Brunson makes the texts seem accessible, providing amazing insights into them. ",
            "\u00a0If one is looking for a sophisticated but introductory approach to masterpieces within Russian literature, this would be the best class to take. Even if that isnt ones interest - a class with Professor Brunson is a must! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Whether you're a student who wants to take an interesting HU credit or is already well-versed in Russian literature, this course is dispensable for understanding many of the important ideas and perspectives within the Russian canon. This course is engaging, especially in the reading, and everyone should know these works. ",
            "\u00a0You have to read these books at some point in your life, because they are total game changers, and it is nice to read them in a structured way with some guidance on what to look for. That being said, I did not find Professor Brunson to be a super insightful or particularly inspiring lecturer. Also, if there's a chance to read these books in a seminar format, do that instead! What I am taking away from this course is mostly about my personal experience reading them, and had little to do with the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is just the right amount of work, and you will emerge with a nuanced view of both Russian masters. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course I have ever taken at Yale. I recommend this with NO RESERVATIONS!!! This course was so impactful and life-changing for me intellectually and also spiritually, and it has altered everything that I thought I wanted to study/pursue in my life. I see Tolstoy and Dostoevsky everywhere now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Don't let the Russian literature title scare you. The readings are well-spaced out and the class gives you ample time to read the longer texts. Essay deadlines are fair and also given far in advance. This is the perfect class to take if you want to be exposed to more diverse readings but at the same time you get to read some of the most ground-breaking and influential texts in history. Most importantly, I promise you will enjoy it too! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Apart from the fact that we're reading the greatest works of humanity in this course, Professor Molly is an incredible instructor who was able to show the beauty of the text to its fullest extend. If life is not chasing after such beauty, then one should indeed just take economics classes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I took this course because I wanted a reason to read great Russian literature, and I got SO much more than that. Professor Brunson is a fantastic lecturerI was more excited for this class every week than any other. There isn't a ton of work besides the reading, which means that you really can focus on reading and understanding the texts...and Russia, and life. Fantastic books, fantastic teaching! "
