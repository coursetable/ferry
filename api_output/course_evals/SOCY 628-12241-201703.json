            "\u00a0I think the strength of this workshop is that it sets a high expectation for attendance for junior fellows. I really appreciate that. However, I think the actual engagement of the fellows should be increased. Some people come and say a lot, while others come and say nothing. And sometimes I gave feedback to the scholar presenting, and wished there was an avenue by which to receive feedback on *my* feedback, so that I can get better at that kind of interaction. \r\n\r\nI also wish that there was more opportunity for interaction throughout the semester with other junior fellows and faculty fellows, visiting scholars, etc. to get to know each other better, like the supper club or other events. \r\n\r\nSometimes I think that the emphasis on the strong program could be made a bit more. Some of the scholars who came to visit, it seemed like they didn't understand the strong program or the format of the workshop. "
