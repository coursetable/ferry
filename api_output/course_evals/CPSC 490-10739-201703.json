            "\u00a0This course is an independent research project (senior project). As such, I learned a lot of new tools and techniques, but as a function of what myself, my partner, and my advisor Professor Radev put into it. ",
            "\u00a0I became much better at managing deadlines, realistic expectations for emerging technologies, and project organization. ",
            "\u00a0How to build an application from conception to completion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about NLP and also about scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read computer science papers and replicate the experiments and results. I learned about NLP, coreference, question answering, and machine learning! ",
            "\u00a0Working without a given schedule, syllabus, and task list, is perhaps the most useful skill one will practice in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of practice finding papers, reading papers, and trying to implement the algorithms described. "

            "\u00a0Strengths- very self-directed, students have the opportunity to make what they want of the class\r\nWeaknesses- felt that especially when it got to the later stages of my project, I could have used more guidance. I know Drago is incredibly busy, but maybe if I'd been assigned to work with a graduate student, it would have been helpful? ",
            "\u00a0No clear requirements/expectations laid out by the department, so its up to you to decide the scope and presentation of your project, which is a double-edged sword. "

            "\u00a0Gotta do it. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this course if you're a CS or EECS major, so yeah. That said, I found it so much more fulfilling to have a say in the research direction and then follow it (partly because I started this initially as a project under CPSC 473 Intelligent Robotics Lab, which had us proposing our own projects) -- it means you have to do a lot more self-guided learning and literature review, but you learn a lot along the way, and gain the kinds of skills that are needed for future research in grad school, etc. If you can a lab or adviser in advance, I also recommend doing some research over the summer before senior year -- it gives you so much more time to focus on just doing research and laying the foundations for you work over the semester, especially if the project requires a lot of backend programming.
