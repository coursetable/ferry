            "\u00a0Stronger understanding of Hebrew language and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. I improved my knowledge of Hebrew, especially grammar and improved my reading, writing, and speaking skills. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Learn a lot of grammar. Reasonable workload. Definitely feel like my control of the language is now more malleable, and I could get around if need be.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Need more vocabulary! For a lot of students, our vocabulary was very limited. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths including interesting class activities and creative assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses included a poorly designed final exam (it spent more time on things we had spent less time on in class, and less time on the things we had spent more time on in class), not enough emphasis on vocabulary, and an odd semester long progress that felt more like hoops to jump through than it did feel like a semester long project with true meaning. Of these problems, the semester long project certainly has potential, and the other two are easy fixes. \r\n\r\nThere were also far to many \"little assignments\" for homework that were a time suck but did not help me practice the skills in a useful way. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught. However, there could be more vocabulary by topic in addition to the grammar. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong in that it covers a lot of material at a feasible pace. It would have been better to have more opportunities to practice speaking with my professor, but there were plenty of other resources that I was able to use to speak to people who were not my professor.
