Whether it was in Sudler Hall, on the firing range, or in an obstacle course, this course tested our ability to lead and follow, as well as develop our strengths and identify our weaknesses as future Naval Officers.

In terms of both workload and rigor, it is probably up there with the most famed labs at Yale, such as Physics 165L. At moments I couldn't decided whether I was engaged in philosophical dialogue with Socrates or in a Froco meeting. Overall, one of my favorite courses at Yale. ",
