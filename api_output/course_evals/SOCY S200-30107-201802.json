            "\u00a0I learned about the global nature of health through a sociological perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Through out this course, I learned a lot about all different parts that are connected to GPH, and the way I think about global public health changed. I also understood that everything is connected with each other, not independent from each other. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered me some fundamental knowledge in the field of global public health. I gained more understanding of the difficulties in the field through learning about the adventures of Paul Farmer and partner in health. It was also very interesting to find out about the stories behind the eradication of small pox, the discovery of the first vaccine and treatment for cholera. I was offered better insight into the barriers and inequalities that still needs to be overcome and realized the need for a persistent global effort in improving public health for the world.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I learned how to structure and produce a research proposal. I am now able to distinguish between different types of data, sampling and research method. I can also analyze the data to comment on issues in global public health. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my understanding about Public Health, including the burdens of diseases and ways to improve the current situation. ",
            "\u00a0The course broaden my mind on worldwide connections in global public health. I was not conscious how health problems in particular area can affect global health. I find really strong and revealing the information about particular situation proving women unprivileged health position. "

            "\u00a0Since it was a summer course, the pacing was quite fast. However, the material was fascinating and the assignments reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that it teaches me a lot of new things that I never knew before and it taught me a lot how to look at all thit different sectors that might influence a thing. For now l, I did t really have any weaknesses at mind so probably no. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n\r\n-group-presentation/discussion. Group presentation enabled everyone in the class to talk about an area in global public health that interests them. While preparing for my presentation on gender and public health, I came across heartbreaking case studies, such as the story of a 17 years old girl who suffered from urinary fistula due to difficulty in giving birth. Her story made me more passionate about empowering women around the world.\r\n-documentary. It gives us more insight into the work people in the field of global public health are doing. Their experiences are very inspiring and enables us to realize that people are using this knowledge we are learning to actually make an impact on the health of the world.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n-The first lesson was entirely lecture and concept based and it was slightly off-putting at the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that all students can stay engaged because they need to do the presentation and there are a lot of class discussion involved.\r\nThere is no really disturbing weakness of this class for me. ",
            "\u00a0I find great getting the agenda before the teachers presentations. I find good preparing the presentation for the class, especially because of the fact that my book was really interesting, but I would like to have more time for preparation. Although I do not find myself as really sensible person, I think some documental films were frightening, so maybe they were too strong for some people in the class  I am not sure, just thinking I find nice short notes that we were about to send before almost each class, because it made me to be on the subject before class, but I would like to get some feedback for the first one to know if I had understood the formula well. I find giving the liberty on which we want to base nice. I would like to get the feedback from assignments and exams a bit earlier. I think writing the proposal was really interesting, I have enjoyed this part of the course. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to be inspired and humbled by the work of others. This course not only taught me concepts in global public health, but more importantly, it taught me that much work still needs to be done in lessening social, gender and health inequality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course allows to understand another perspective of global health that many people havent thought about. The students learn from a great professor. The work class is demanding but worthwhile. This class reflects about many of the issues societies around the world are facing right now and leaves you thinking about what you can do to help. ",
