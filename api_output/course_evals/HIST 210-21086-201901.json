            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about the Early Middle Ages - and gained a much better understanding of the antecedents to the more modern European history I did know. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough understanding of how the legacy of the Roman empire transitioned into the medieval world. I also developed a more nuanced understanding of what exactly the \"medieval\" world was, and in what ways it was a continuity of the Classical world. This course enabled me to see the legacies of medieval Europe and classical Roman civilization on the Western world today. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of a period that is not usually talked about, incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained very good insight into the Middle Ages, as well as  cultural, religious, and political changes post fall of the Roman Empire. ",
            "\u00a0An introduction to the history of the early middle ages and exposure to religious trends during this period. Great primary source readings and engaging lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I have acquired a greater appreciation for events and themes in medieval European history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about history in the medieval period and how history cannot merely be seen in a teleological sense, but rather is a series of contingent processes. Additionally, I developed the ability to approach history through adopting multiple lenses of historical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Early Middle Ages and honed my ability to distill broad themes from specific readings and information. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent study of Mediterranean and Western European history of Late Antiquity and start of the medieval period. The first half of the course was grounded in the legacy of Rome. It was cool to learn about the rise of Christianity and Late Rome, its Fall, and its legacy in European history for the next centuries: in the Germanic \"Barbarian\" tribes, the Merovingians and Carolingians, in the Church and its heresies, in the East in Byzantium and Persia. The second half of the term concentrated on the consolidation of political power in the East under the Muslim conquests and in the West under the Charlemagne. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave students an insight into the factors contributing to the downfall of the Western Roman Empire and allowed us to examine the various different societies which succeeded it in the years from roughly 300-1000 AD. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of techniques and principles used by historians. I learned to analyze primary sources in new ways. Also gained a lot of knowledge of the Early Middle Ages and how earlier institutions survived into the period and other institutions survive from this period to the modern day. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing insights into how the Dark Ages were not that at all, and a great foundation of the evolution of modern Europe from a post-Roman context ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about effective rulers (effective succession, what makes people revolt, indicators of good leadership). I also learned how to synthesize text and discuss it far more effectively than I had before. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible course! I learned so much about early medieval history, and learned a lot about reading early medieval texts and understanding the religious, political and social contexts of the texts and events.  I also just know tons of cool facts now about early medieval heresies!  I also thoroughly enjoyed learning about the Christianization of various rulers and kingdoms. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: very knowledgeable and funny professor, so lecture was never boring; interesting material; good organization; my TA, Mallory, was fantastic; very manageable reading/work load.\r\nNo real weaknesses, though it was a bit unpleasant to write the final 10-15 page research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freedman's lectures were engaging and enjoyable to attend, and he did a great job framing each topic within the larger context to enable us to see connections across regions and across time. The readings were very interesting, especially the primary sources. Discussion sections were well designed to give us a chance to discuss the topics and the readings. ",
            "\u00a0All strengths, although the readings could have been more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the readings each week were interesting and that lectures were always engaging. One weakness is that Professor Freedman does not use powerpoint slides when he lectures although this is not inherently a bad thing. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredibly well taught lecture course. Professor Freedman's lectures are both entertaining and insightful, the readings are well selected (and the amount is generally reasonable). My only complaint is the section of the vikings and the last lecture. As entertaining as Anders Winroth was, his lectures were really disappointing because I don't think I learned anything particularly meaningful (although joking in section about his \"the vikings were metrosexuals\" comment was honestly really fun). I would much rather have had Professor Freedman teach both of those. The last lecture, similarly, was definitely fun, but I wish that it had covered a little more of what the readings had talked about and just generally focused more on finishing out our discussion of the period. Lastly, both a research paper and a final is a little excessive. I understand the logic of it, but I literally did more writing for this class than for my junior seminar which feels a little wrong. I think at least one of the papers should be cut to keep this course more in line with the workload of other history courses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freedman was a terrific lecturer and was very engaged with the course. The only discernible weakness of the course were the two Vikings lectures at the end. I feel like I learned nothing about the Vikings relative to everything else in the course. I could not begin to answer the Vikings question on the final. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course is definitely its focus on a period of history that is generally too simplified. This course provides a valuable perspective on the late antique period which provides invaluable insight into the origins of modern Europe. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very enigmatic, and made an expansive topic accessible. The discussion sections were helpful in synthesizing the reading materials in addition to the thematic points covered in lectures. Our section was very small though (8 students), which made it difficult to keep an active conversation going, especially if somebody was absent or quieter. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well-run because lecture orients everyone and contextualizes the readings, and section helps students take their understanding a level deeper. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures and effective sections were large strength of this course. Prof. Freedman is a very interesting and effective lecturer, and his graduate teaching fellows are up-to-date on the important concepts to review in section and exam review sessions. The exams have a lot of writing but are very fair in that they cover the main themes of the course.\r\nI feel that the history of the course was also well-balanced. We explored the Western and Eastern Roman and Persian Empires, important Germanic groups and their kingdoms, the rise of Christianity and the Catholic Church, and the Arab conquests with the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid Caliphates. I may have also liked some more history of Eastern Europe, but it is also probably a good call that we focused on the more \"exciting\" history in the West and Near East. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-planned out, material was organized well across the lectures during the semester, and each lecture was incredibly interesting and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0It's not flashy but it's pleasant. Interesting and underrated topic helps to keep it exciting, and Professor Freedman has good jokes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fun lectures, enjoyable readings, TAs provide a list of IDs before exams that really helps, instructors really make themselves available for your questions about essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wickham is a little too dense, it would be good if the TAs always did a little \"cliffnotes\" of the most important notes from the chapter of that reading. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freedman is and INCREDIBLE lecturer.  The information is all fascinating, but a more defined geographic scope would have been nice going in.  For example, I had hoped to focus more on Northern Europe (Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia) but these took up only four lectures. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Prof Freedman is great, and this is a really interesting period to learn about - it will give you a totally new understanding of things you thought you knew about, such as the Roman Empire, and things I, at least, didn't know about at all - such as the Vikings, barbarian tribes, and the Rise of Islam. It also is not a lot of work - the readings are short and interesting/relevant to the course, which is perfect. If you are a history major, I think this is a great pre-industrial credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students - I am a STEM major, and I still found this class very enjoyable and worthwhile. You will be surprised at how much insight into our modern world you will glean through learning about the early middle ages, and Professor Freedman is an engaging and entertaining lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Freedman is an amazing instructor and this period is highly overlooked in modern academic circles. If you have any inclination to take this course, definitely do, you will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The topic was interesting and Prof. Freedman was a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they had an interest in the time period or just because the class is taught by Prof Freedman since I think he is a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Early Middle Ages is a great and engaging class about a great range of topics (its a survey course about 700+ years!) people don't generally know much about. Its focus on general trends that are applicable to modern history as well added another layer of sophistication. Professor Freedman is funny and approachable; the TAs were lovely and very knowledgeable. The essays (1 short midterm response paper,  1 longer research paper) and exams (midterm and final) are really not hard at all. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of my favorite history courses I've taken at Yale. Paul Freedman is a wonderful lecturer, and this is such an interesting period that I genuinely enjoyed coming to class every time (even when we were talking about weird heresies and other things that I didn't initially thing I was going to be interested in). Paul is also super quotable, like some truly incredible jokes were made in lecture and it was just wonderful. The only problem with this course is that the workload is a little bit heavy compared to other similar survey lectures. Having a 7-8 page paper, a midterm, a final research paper, and a final is A LOT (like I wrote more for this class than for my junior seminar), and the readings are generally not much more than your average lecture, but some of it is pretty dense (looking at you Augustine's Confessions (on the other hand, reading Procopius Secret History was a truly wild time and I would highly recommend)). Don't let the workload scare you away from this course though! I honestly enjoyed writing the papers because I thought the topics were so interesting, and the midterm and final are both very fair (the midterm was WAAAAY too long for the amount of time provided, but they were really fair with the grading). This is just such a good class, and Paul Freedman is so nice and willing to talk and you should not miss the chance to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I enjoyed the lectures and the pace of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class that provides an overview of the time period. Readings were useful supplement to class and the primary sources were fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in going beyond the typical historiography of the medieval period. This course provides an invaluable view into Medieval life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. It ties together interesting events of the early world which are often left separate, and for History majors looking for a pre-Industrial credit I think this is the most rewarding course the department offers. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because this period of history is often understudied, and this class provides an excellent survey of the time period. They would learn a lot and enjoy their time doing so. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a student interested in early history. This course is on the unique period of Late Antiquity: the intersection of classical history with the early middle ages. It includes exciting concepts like Late Rome and its Fall, the rise of Christianity, the Church and its heresies, \"Barbarian\" tribes, Byzantium, Islamic conquests, and Charlemagne! The lectures of Prof. Freedman are epic, and chose to take this course largely from my great experience with Prof. Freedman in HIST 211: The Birth of Europe last spring. Also recommend that class, offered every other Spring with this one. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-history major, this course was quite engaging and highlighted a historical period that it not as talked about as its peers. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the time period. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah if you like history and are interested in the period. Fun heresies. Lots of Islamic history. There are probably more exciting courses, but I would consider this a sleeper hit. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as not only is the material just super interesting, but so is Prof. Freedman. He explains things very clearly yet in a way that incorporates all the various complexities and hes also just a really funny guy too. ",
            "\u00a0It's not the easiest pre-industrial credit you could get for the History major for sure, but you do get to learn from a great professor about a large period of time which very few people have really learned about. The readings are always quite interesting, and you learn how to pull together large periods of time and seemingly disparate pieces of information. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  This is such a fun course if you like early medieval history, or really any history that is bloody, religious and full of ruthlessness!  And Professor Freedman is incredible.  Don't take this because you think it'll be a gut.  It's not.  But it's super fun if you're going to engage with the primary and secondary sources and participate in lecture. "
