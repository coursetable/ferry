We analyzed how our personal health and public health are shaped by\r\nsocial structures, political struggles, expert knowledge, and medical markets. I learned about the \r\ncultural and social meanings associated with health and illness; inequalities in health and health\r\ncare access and provision; controversies surrounding healthcare, medical knowledge production,\r\nand medical decision-making; and the social institutions of the health care industry. ",
            "\u00a0This class was surprising to say the least. I kind of wish we spent more time of certain subjects as opposed to a new subject each class period because the end of the class seemed somewhat less important (topic wise) and, in my opinion, were less interesting than the topics discussed in the first half. Overall though, great class! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about healthcare systems and how we as a society socially construct health and healthcare. I learned more about the interconnections of society and public health. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course, and it encouraged me to think about health in society in a new light. The material was very interesting, and it made me interested in exploring this in my career. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so, so much about health and healthcare, which some of us take for granted. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of this course was understanding the difference between a disease and an illness, and how the latter was socially constructed! Also, for the book review assignment, I read \"Being Mortal\" and it turned out to be one of my favorite books ever. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much insight into the healthcare system of America and abroad. I learned a lot about the health disparities and inequities faced by many different groups in the US, the benefits and drawbacks of different types of healthcare systems, health insurance, and the relationships between society, illness, and healthcare. ",

            "\u00a0This is obviously a new course. I think above all, there needs to be a reason to be in class after the midterm. I think this was an accident, but after the midterm, there was only two paper grades and section participation left to be accounted for. Therefore, you really didn't need to be in class for the second half of the semester, which a lot of the class clearly took note of, which was sad. They missed out, but I feel like this could be fixed with a final (I don't know if that would be as conducive) or something else. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Really kind professor, great material, amazing introduction to health pathway! ",
            "\u00a0The readings and topic were very interesting and formative for my learning experience. Prof. Menon was really understanding, communicative and flexible. \r\n\r\nImproved by:\r\nMore interaction in lecture ",

            "\u00a0A strength is the scope of material we cover in a short amount of time, but overall I think the course was slightly unorganized. I think it would do better as a smaller class where students could engage in discussion more. The assignments also seemed to be out of a need to assign students a grade, so I think they could be tailored to allow students to explore things they are interested in. Sometimes, it was very unclear what was expected from students for the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course is wonderfully organized in terms of topics, which are all very interesting in and of themselves. Professor Menon is a terrific lecturer (I love how she puts \"Key Takeaways' in her presentations) and the TA's are all wonderful as well. The workload isn't bad at all, and the readings are always interesting. There's something in particular that I would change to the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely interesting, organized, and well-structured. Every lecture makes sense on its own, but makes even more sense when seen in the broader context of the course as a whole. The class structure works well- having readings before lecture, as well as a midterm, a review paper, and a final paper. I do not have any recommendations to improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor and interesting material! She tried to cover a lot of topics in a short period of time. I felt like the assignments were open-ended but then had overly particular grading rubric. ",

            "\u00a0The content was very interesting but I think there were moments where the information could be conveyed a lot more concisely. There were many nuggets of gold but also some pieces of fluff. Overall a very interesting course. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Menon is a good lecturer and the course concepts are interesting. I think the midterm and final paper were fair. I do think that the book review didn't contribute to my learning, and that the book selections weren't that great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging material and lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class got bogged down in the sociological theories and jargon, so it felt a bit too (and unnecessarily) theoretical at times. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Prof Menon and the TAs were really helpful and understanding. The course was slow-paced which is helpful for those who are new to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Some assignments were confusing in the delivery of instructions and (confusing in the grading), but that could just be me being bitter. Sometimes some of the lectures could feel a little bit entry-level but also this is an entry-level course. The lecture slides when referred back on were really empty and unhelpful in terms of reviewing. ",

            "\u00a0Great lecture topics ",

I read the death gap for reference. ",
            "\u00a0It would be beneficial to have a final. There was lackluster attendance after the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how there was only a midterm, book review, and final paper because you could focus on learning rather than being stressed about the material. The final paper allowed you to explore a topic of interest, which I found to be rewarding. One the flip side of the coin for the low workload, it was difficult to be motivated to attend class after the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This was Professor Menon's first time teaching at Yale. She was very engaged in the material and helpful to students who came in with questions. However, the assignments and midterms were often unclear in terms of her expectations and left a lot of room for error that was penalized when grading. I think more practice midterm questions, clearer rubrics etc would have made the assignments more managable. ",
            "\u00a0Strong course, interesting material. Perhaps a greater focus on dialogue and conversation in section as opposed to just reviewing what happened in the readings and lectures. Tons of interesting content in the course, but it didn't feel like we had the chance to really interact with one another about it, so perhaps more focus on having conversations about the implications of course material in section. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really engaging and Professor Menon is a great lecturer. However, the section for the class was a little bit disorganized and did not help me understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture is absolutely fascinating, workload wasn't too high, readings were interested (albeit a bit long). Professor Menon is a significant part of why this class was successful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section was sometimes less than stimulating/less than helpful. Somewhat a waste of time with the way that it was run. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should have been a final because that would have kept students more engaged ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Menon was a huge asset to the class - her lectures were always really engaging, and made sense of pretty complicated topics. I think the main improvement to be made is to have a better defined arc to the class, since the topics didn't always seem to complement or naturally follow one another, especially in the second half of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really interesting material, an engaging lecture and very interesting readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: after midterm a lot of people would not go to class...so it would have been nice if the attendance was better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - We covered so much interesting content! I also really liked how we touched on historical concepts such as the Black Panther Party in the mid and late 1900s, and the creation of black hospitals.\r\nWeaknesses - N/A ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Varied topics, we kind of wade through history and sociology as well as bits of science. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It felt kinda open-ended in the end. Like we were introduced to medicalization and biomedicalization theories through texts which painted them in a kind of damning light... but not to different lenses that we could use to analyze illness and disease in society. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course included the lectures, the readings, and the structure of assignments. Could be improved by lectures slides that were a little bit more conducive to exam review. ",
            "\u00a0There was some miscommunication between the professor and the TAs, which resulted in confusion about the expectations of the assignments and what we needed to know for the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This class does a great job of combining theory/overarching concepts and specific examples from U.S. and global history/current events. In terms of weaknesses, I was a little frustrated that assessment of essays was based exclusively on a very strict rubric (the emphasis on the rubric sometimes discouraged me from really engaging with that I was writing about or taking it in a direction that I thought was meaningful). It seemed like strict adherence to the rubric was more important than anything else in terms of essays. This focus on the rubric seemed a little out of place in a class that otherwise encouraged students to speak up, make their own interpretations, challenge ideas, etc. "
