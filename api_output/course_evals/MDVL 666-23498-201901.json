            "\u00a0A much better understanding of romance Old English prose and poetry and the history that surrounds the genre. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge about the genre of ancient romance, Anglo-Saxon romance literature and Old English hagiography increased greatly through taking this course. My ability to read Old English also improved. My classmates and Professor Thornbury offered insightful comments about the texts and we had engaging discussions, which deepened my understanding and appreciation of the literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really good for strengthening my Old English skills and for developing my understanding of how literary transmission and adaptation worked in Anglo-Saxon England (or perhaps more precisely how we understand it to work, and how we might further augment that understanding through thinking more expansively and creatively about genre). I also found this course to provide a useful way of thinking about (particularly in the case of Andreas and Elene) how different forms of historical thought, as well as different historical trends and currents, have shaped the works we read and how we apprehend them; I think the many influences going into an Old English translation or adaptation are so often examined separately that it is easy to lose sight of how they interact and work together, which this class highlighted very nicely.

            "\u00a0The workload was a lot sometimes, but it was a great course overall. It really expanded my knowledge on the topic and challenged me intellectually. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was its focus on Old English literature which is not often read and studied in comparison with classics like Beowulf or the Wanderer, encouraging us to think in new ways about the Old English literary canon. For instance, none of my previous literature classes which had an Old English component had ever compared Old English hagiographical literature with Luke-Acts and other ancient romances (except for Apollonius of Tyre). Another strength of the course was the focused research of the final project, which encouraged us to critically compare the Old English texts with their literary and generic milieu. A weakness of the course was perhaps the lack of time to go through the entirety of the texts that we read/translated for class, but this seems an insurmountable issue due to the time constraint and I would not want to have read fewer texts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and its balance of primary and secondary readings. Clearly Late Antique romance was a great organizing principle for an Old English reading course; we covered a wide array of Old English literature, and likewise a wide array of scholarship, from the more classical to the more innovative. I think that there could have been more readings on different approaches to genre, but Emily was very helpful discussing genre more broadly both in class and in office hours, so this wasn't necessarily a problem.

            "\u00a0This course was a little challenging, but became more and more manageable throughout the year. It is tough if you don't have a good background in Old English, but I learned a lot and got better. I would recommend it, but only to someone willing to put a lot of work into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in Old English literature and/or hagiography who wants to read texts that are off the beaten path in Old English studies. The student would need to be comfortable reading Old English though, because it would be very difficult for them to get through all of the readings otherwise, especially the poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Of course I would proselytize Old English! But I think specifically as an introductory course this was very well set up in its range and organization (working from arguably the easiest Old English prose through to some more difficult poetry) and I think Emily's course was an innovative and exciting approach to the literature.
