            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to many physical and mathematical concepts in astonomy that I wasn't previously familiar with. This course served as a great overview of all of the math behind astronomical phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0The main topics covered in this course are fluid dynamics and radiative processes. There are several other courses at Yale which teach fluid dynamics and this class will be different than those. Here the professor takes the almost unique pedagogical approach of deriving the Navier-Stokes equations from Hamiltonian mechanics. Along the way you encounter pretty heavy statistical mechanics. This approach allows an easy introduction to plasma physics which stems from a very similar derivation to ordinary fluid dynamics. This course is taught at a high level yet emphasizes qualitative understanding over mathematical maturity. The main notes for the class (written by the professor) are available on his website. If you are thinking of taking this course and want a closer look at the material covered, head there and check them out. "

            "\u00a0If you have not taken PHYS 401 or 410 yet, this class will be fairly difficult. A solid math background will also help a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I struggled with this course because of the lack of feedback you get along the way. I felt like everything I learned came from the review I did during finals week. I think that was because I tried to learn everything during lecture, when I should have just listened and then read his very comprehensive lecture notes after. The derivations were the focus in lecture, but they were hard to follow especially without beind solid in math background. The psets were tough and not regular enough that I felt they corresponded to what we learned in class. If there was a more clear understanding of the expectations on us in this course from the start, I would have gotten a lot more out of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course has an excellent professor. The lecture is lively and worth attending.\r\n\r\nThere is however some issue with how the material is taught. The main problem is in getting the students to engage with the material. As it currently stands it is easy for student engagement with the course to be pretty low: there is little homework and not much expected of us in lecture. I would be interested in seeing a two-track problem set system. What if, instead of bi-weekly (or even tri-weekly) problem sets, we had weekly problem sets which alternated in flavor. One week would contain what could be called exercises: simple applications of the concepts from lecture. The other week would then contain one or maybe two longer problems which aimed to synthesize several weeks worth of material. The problem sets that we did have were useful and these problems do not need to be gotten rid of. Instead some of them could become the beginnings of exercise problem sets and others could be extended into fuller problems (I am thinking in particular of the problem on bondi accretion). By adding an extra \"exercises\" problem set every week I think you could increase student engagement without increasing the workload too much: this \"exercises\" problem set is not meant to be strenuous but only to encourage engagement (it could even be made optional). Another option is to assign a reading every week (either from the lecture notes or a historical paper) and to have reading quizzes (either at the start of lecture or through Canvas). Anything you can do to encourage student engagement would make a huge difference. The course is interesting but if you do not work us we will not work.\r\n\r\nA specific plea is to encourage a more hands on approach to the Navier-Stokes equations. Something needs to be done in addition to simply understanding what the terms in the equations mean. Even just providing solutions and asking us to plug them in and check that they are solutions would be beneficial in understanding them.\r\n\r\nThe term paper was an excellent way to draw some concrete use out of the concepts learned in the course.

            "\u00a0Only if you need it ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course covers fascinating material, but keep in mind that there will be almost no structure to it. For those wanting to truly learn the material, take differential equations and linear algebra before it, and definitely advanced physics as well. Dr. van den Bosch is an interesting person and obviously very brilliant, but I struggled following everything in class. Reviewing his thorough lecture notes in the last week prepared me for the exam and I feel like I at least have seen these things now, and that will help me later. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course does not require much out of you but just know that to get anything out of it you will have to do more work than required. There are about 5 problem sets, a term paper and a final (he will probably give you the option to take it either written or oral). Astro majors have to take this course but you will find some other people in the course too, usually physics or applied math majors. If you are shopping and unsure about this course definitely visit the professor's website for the course to help you make up your mind. "
