There definitely could have been more problem sets, even optional ones, just to reinforce the material, and Asher maybe could have progressed through it faster so that we could have gotten to some of the more advanced topics, like adeles and zeta functions.

This is almost a natural extension of Galois Theory (no pun intended), and a really cool continuation of the concepts developed in that course. It's also a really neat generalization of factoring integers into primes to factoring ideals into prime ideals in rings of integers, so totally recommend this course to someone interested in that. "
