            "\u00a0Screenwriting rests in the strange position of requiring both theory and practice. One needs to learn the foundations of screenwriting and storytelling but at the same time this theory will go to waste without practice. Advanced Screenwriting is able to accomplish both of these through the course's structure. By writing your own screenplay, you gain valuable practice and receive the critique of those around you to help develop your individual idea. By reading the scripts of others, it allows you to review the theory of storytelling and screenwriting which circles back in helping you when writing your own script. ",

            "\u00a0The course is very strong overall. The only way it could be improved would be to occasionally analyze past successful screenplays in what makes them successful. This was done in earlier screenwriting classes and a reflection back would be a nice way to step back from the stories we are writing ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is definitely the workshop environment and the opportunity to get feedback on various phases and drafts of our work throughout the whole year. It might be useful to have stricter deadlines as to when everyone has to have a first draft done by, but overall I think this class runs as it should. ",
