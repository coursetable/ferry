            "\u00a0This course taught me how to write strong argumentative essays and use concrete evidence to support my thesis. Though it sounds easy, I really learned how to structure my essays to best communicate my thoughts. I also learned how to critically analyze some of the Western tradition's most important historical and political texts. ",
            "\u00a0How to write good essays and how to present my ideas in sections. I think I've learned more in one semester than I did in three years of high school. ",
            "\u00a0- Essay writing skills; how to develop an argument from its precepts, and explore it in  substantial way\r\n- How to read a piece in both a charitable and critical way ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies Historical & Political Thought gave me a deeper understanding of the underlying political philosophy of the western tradition. H&P taught me contexts for the other works I read throughout DS. It gave me more full skills in argumentation and communication as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about historical views of politics and the relationships between governments and people. I also learned how to write a compelling short history paper, and how to aim my thoughts in class to be most useful to the class. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned how to read critically and isolate important material from a large amount of content in order to form a controversial and original thesis. Instead of writing standard five paragraph essays as I did in high school, I developed a logical progression with each of my paragraphs that led to a nuanced thesis. I realized for the first time that the bulk of the work was not in the writing but in developing and planning my argument to say something original or tease out a new insight. I think my writing ability and most improved my thinking skills have improved substantially thanks to feedback I received on my essays and seminar contributions. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to be concise in articulating my ideas and, more theoretically, the different strands of historical and political philosophy that were built up over the centuries, beginning with Herodotus. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking, articulating thoughts into coherent discussion, and reading analysis. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings we had, although there were times when we were overloaded with some reading assignments, like Augustine's City of God. My professor was fantastic, but mamy of my friends were not satisfied with the structure of their discussion seminars. There's also a very obvious air of superiority some of my classmates had, which I think detracted from my learning. ",
            "\u00a0So much to do, so little time. If you can finish the reading before class, the discussions will be meaningful and thought provoking. The lectures are mostly amazing, your peers are brilliant and there's a lot to learn from them, and Professor Oskian gives great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0It was highly interesting to witness and study the development of historical and political thought; yet the brevity of our study made some of the material a little less engaging, because we had no time to properly converse with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of giving students opportunities to express their own opinions on a work while learning about established interpretations. I loved the discussion-based sections and found the lectures to be insightful. This class to me facilitated learning and thought better than all my other classes at Yale (although the others did a great job too). I have no complaints about this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in breadth of material it covered. I think at times though there was too much material, and I was not able to focus as deeply on the material as I would have liked since I just didn't have enough time. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course really emphasized close reading and critical thinking and, with Professor Oskian's help, I learned how to take an idea or thought and develop it into a comprehensive and well-reasoned argument. Our class assignments in which we wrote a commentary or response to a specific passage ensured that every person participated and already had a point ready for discussions. Professor Oskian also build off each person's comments to illustrate the wider implications of the work we were reading and connected different students' comments to show general themes and trends within the work. Because of this method, the comments never felt scattered but led to a deeper inquiry into an idea or topic that we developed throughout the class. Despite the pace of the class, I felt that I did get a deeper understanding though seminar discussions and delving into a single idea in my essay. However, given the length of material, I don't think a class period or week even is sufficient to discuss these texts, and I sometimes felt that I missed out when we had to move to the next book. However, this is not a fault of this course, but rather the structure of DS as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe only other suggestion I would make would be to provide more feedback on the biweekly reading responses so that students can further improve their close reading and have the opportunity to delve deeper into the text. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that the course covered significant scope with regards to the number of texts and writers we explored; however, this also meant that insufficient time was allocated to each test. "

            "\u00a0If you decide to take DS, try your hardest to get into Prof. Oskian's section. She is phenomenal!! I genuinely don't know if I would've learned the material well or enjoyed it if I hadn't had her as my professor. She definitely focuses on improving your writing to make it more precise and effective, and our class discussions are well-structured. She facilitates those discussions quite well, so our section didn't fall prey to the mush some other students complained about in their discussions. Overall, I'm thankful to both Prof. Oskian and DS for improving the quality and strength of my writing. If that's what you're aiming to get out of your first semester at Yale, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in political science or history, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, DS offered me a powerfully insightful glimpse into the development of history and our current state of international affairs today. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily because of the amount of growth I have seen in my writing and argumentative skills, I would highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of learning, excellent texts, good writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly would. I believe the content we engaged with was of direct importance to the world today and I particularly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Although it's fast-paced and a heavier workload, the material is worth it. I love the fact that I can now trace the development of ideas  and philosophies from Herodotus all the way to Machiavelli and discuss the giants of Western thought like Aristotle, Augustine, and Machiavelli. I don't know how often I can bring it up during dinner conversation, but understanding the progressions of politics has already had an influence on my politics views and changed the way I think about government today.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course was a significant investment and the reading is extensive, but, if your interested in the material, it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As someone with little prior background on western historical and political thought, the course was manageable but challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely, intellectual stimulation to the max. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. It was hellish, but once I finished all of my work, I felt incredibly proud. If you like being pushed them you should take DS "
