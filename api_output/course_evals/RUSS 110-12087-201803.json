            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to Russian grammar and vocabulary and a window into Russian culture. I feel like I'm leaving this course with a much stronger grasp on Russian than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Russian! How to read, talk about myself and my interests/habits/family in the present, past, and future tenses, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a fairly solid amount of basic Russian and feel comfortable moving on to L2. ",
            "\u00a0Through the course, I developed the skill to pick up patterns in the language and was able to comprehend a lot of the format of the Russian language. It also gave me a bit of insight to how much languages in general share common roots as well as how it can adopt from other languages. ",
            "\u00a0First-year Russian provides basic conversational skills, the foundations of Russian grammar, and an introduction to common vocabulary. At the end of the course, you can speak about daily activities, your family, and your interests. ",
            "\u00a0Great foundation of the Russian language ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken a language class of any real substance before this class, and I found it enriching how much of the Russian language we were able to learn and engage with over the course of the semester. Not only did I develop a greater understanding of Russian grammar and language, but this class also dramatically improved my English as well. "

            "\u00a0Sometimes it's difficult to understand why or when a certain rule will apply and getting a clear explanation is almost impossible. But Julia and the TFs are great and the small class size allows for a lot of practice and correction. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course:\r\n\r\nYou learn a LOT, and very quickly, too. You have at least one test/quiz a week, which may seem like a pain but is actually a blessing for keeping you on track. Julia always keeps class very interesting - she has a hilarious and often biting sense of humor - which is quite important to make it through a 9:25am every single day. She also explains concepts quite well. The class is very well-organized - nightly homework keeps you on track, etc. Also, the Live from Russia Video is absolutely hilarious and always the highlight of my week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often Julia will not specify exactly what words will be on quizzes, etc., which can be confusing. Overall, I didn't find the class too hard until late December/early November, when I got very overwhelmed and confused - a lot of cases and verbs are introduced at once. Nonetheless, Julia and the TAs are available to help! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nExcellent teaching from professor and TFs \r\nRegular office hours \r\nGreat textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNot enough opportunities to speak the target language ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course involved how much students were involved in class as well as how each function of a sentence was well explained. However, a clear weakness was the lack of needed practice in speaking the language. I think this could be improved by adding more time in class where students speak more. I also think that vocabulary should be more heavily looked at as it was in the beginning of the semester. It would improve how much people are able to speak. ",
            "\u00a0The course relies heavily on repetition to make sure that the grammar concepts and vocabulary become second nature. The homework is always a great review of the classwork, and the tests and quizzes are straight forward and good benchmarks of knowledge. There is nothing I would suggest to improve. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good L1 course, with a very reasonable workload.  I did find sometimes there are more quizzes than necessary, and more in class practice would be better than extra quizzes, but overall solid foundation. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was when a new concept was introduced we would be called on to apply it/use it in a sentence. That was much more helpful than having us just write it down to study later. Office hours were also fairly frequent. \r\nA weakness is the extremely fast paced nature of the course which made it hard to keep up, as well as ambiguity surrounding what we should learn for that week/assessment ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was well-designed in most respects, and I was grateful for the constant support from professors/TFs regarding office hours and course material. The only notable weakness for me was that the middle of the course seemed dramatically easier than the end, and I think we would have appreciated a pacing strategy that allowed us more time on the last two units of material.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the Russian language and is willing to put the work in to learn a whole new alphabet and complex grammar rules. Julia is great to work with and cares about us learning both the language and the culture and my TF, Jacob, was great at teaching us because he understood what it was like to have to learn Russian from scratch. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who wants to learn Russian. If you just want to fill a language requirement, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. And, even if you do want Russian, you have to REALLY want to learn Russian and be determined to make it happen - waking up early every single day, memorizing a billion cases, etc., is often unpleasant. Moreover, Russian is much harder than Spanish/French/etc. Nonetheless, you learn a remarkable amount in one semester - I don't think the course could be taught/organized any better than it currently is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The content is wonderful and I'm confident anyone would get something out of taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students as the course is well developed. I think that Russian, as difficult as it is, has been made into an easier to understand language through the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The professor, Julia Titus, was incredible as were the TFs; all the instructors were helpful during office hours and during class. For anyone interested in Russian, I would highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn Russian with a good solid foundation ",
            "\u00a0If they are willing to make the commitment or if they have a background in Russian, yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Not only did I develop a strong beginning knowledge of Russian; I also became more immersed in Russian culture through literature and music over the semester. My favorite part of this course was the poetry reader that I was able to start using approximately halfway through the semester. As a lover of literature, reading my parents Pushkin over the phone was incredibly exciting. I also think that the structure of this class - native-speaking professor with an English-native TF in a small classroom setting - was really conducive to a positive learning experience. "
