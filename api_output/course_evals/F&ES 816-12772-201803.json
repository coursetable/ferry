            "\u00a0I gained a ton of knowledge and insights about the utility industry. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the electric grid and the regulation, economics and science behind it. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive (though not too in-depth) understanding of the electric grid and challenges surrounding the industry as it transitioned in the past few decades to meet the changing demand. "

            "\u00a0I was expecting to learn more about how the renewable energy industry was transforming the utility sector. However, the first half of the class focused solely on how electric utilities work. I think this portion should be shortened down. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned well with my expectations. I'd say I even learned more content than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0My expectations aligned pretty well with what the class contained. ",

            "\u00a0There is a vast amount of information which I will have to go review later on. Larry is clearly an expert practicioner ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized with a variety of interesting topics.  However, 3 hours of straight lecture so late in the day was very hard to sit through.  The class could be improved by either splitting in into 2 different days, making the class earlier in the day, or breaking up the class with something other than lecture (small group activities or discussion, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class, it really dives into the details of how utilities work and make their decisions ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the field trip and guest lecturers. I think the class should focus more on the disruption to the industry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the knowledge and experience that Larry brings and the ISO-NE trip. Weaknesses include the sometimes dry presentation of material/content. Finding more interesting ways to convey the information (instead of a lot of text on PP slides) would be an improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a really good introduction on how utilities function, however the class is quite long (3 hours) and can be pretty dry because the professor is lecturing the whole time. It might be better to break up the time in class with exercises or trying to engage the students more. ",
            "\u00a0The field trip to ISO-NE was a really cool experience. I think the class met for too long compared to the material addressed. I think topics could've been more efficiently covered. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great introduction to the field, and the ISO field trip was really interesting.  The course could be improved somewhat by making the lectures more interactive and by providing better explanations of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were placed at an awkward time and it could be a little hard to stay concentrated all the way from 4 pm to 6:50 pm. The lectures were also very densely packed with bullet point-heavy slides, which I guess was presented according to industry standard but could be hard to follow at times. Fortunately, slides were released ahead of time so that we can annotate, and assignments did help with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job providing a broad overview of the electric utility industry in the United States. It will provide you with a lot of information that you can look back on at any point in the form of very comprehensive and text-heavy presentations. That said, there is a lot of information and it is delivered in a dry way so it is hard to stay engaged during such a long class. "

            "\u00a0You'll learn a TON about the Electric utility world- all the way from 20 years ago to the most recent issues ",
            "\u00a0Work in groups for the problem sets.  Start the projects early.  Enlist help from the TF. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend to students with an interest in working with utilities. This class probably covers every topic you need to know ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in electric utilities and working in the energy sector this is a good class to take. However, if you're hoping to learn primarily about renewable energies this is not the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Although the material can be a bit dry and the delivery can be a bit boring, you learn an incredible amount about utilities. So if you're interested in the industry or energy generally, I would still recommend taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0There's no need to do all of the readings, but take advantage of some of them for the case study and final presentation you have to do. ",
            "\u00a0The class gives you a very comprehensive view of the utility industry. If you are interested in how clean energy will integrate with the grid, this is a good class to take. Lectures can sometimes be dry and long, but there's lots of information to absorb. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you have enough time to do the reading.  Be aware that there is a lot of econ in this course, so if the student doesn't have any experience with the economics, they may be at a disadvantage.  Start the final paper early (before it is announced in class)! ",
            "\u00a0This is not a gut. You will suffer if you did not come in with a strong interest already. ",
            "\u00a0This is a light lift and does give you a good overview of the utilities industry, but it is a dry class. "
