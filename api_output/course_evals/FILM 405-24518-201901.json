            "\u00a0I learned basic media theory in addition to experimental modes of thinking about 'natural' phenomenaclouds, fire, sea, skyas media. I also improved my writing skills, having the chance to play around with different genresan object essay, a book review, a research paper. This class enabled and encouraged original thinking. I learned to be more creative!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to examine media through the lens of science, and vice versa. I gained a much broader definition of media that will definitely change my understanding of media studies questions going forward. I was also exposed to a lot of great writing on elements of the natural world that gave me a greater understanding of current studies, and gave me a new frame through which to look at the world myself. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a phenomenal, if unconventional, introduction to media theory. The flexibility of the class made it engaging, the guest speakers added a new dimension to our understanding, and Professor Peters made every class an incredible and multifaceted exploration. The class was a bit disorganized, but Professor Peters made it wholly worthwhile every week. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great exercise in rethinking and dislodging my framework for thinking about humanities v. sciences, nature v. culture, etc. Not only did I learn a lot of fascinating, compelling information from our readings, but I learned to approach this information from a truly interdisciplinary understanding of how the world operates and is structured. I learned to write an academic book review, and to immerse myself in a media study. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting course. Peters is an intriguing and innovative thinker  as reflected in his own scholarly work  and he leads the class as such. You'll practice thinking outside the box. ",
            "\u00a0Elemental media truly offered me a whole new way of thinking. I had never taken a media theory course, and the kinds of questions asked in the discipline are mind-expanding. Topics I was very familiar with, like climate change, are approached from a whole new angle. Within media theory, Professor Peters is a nonconformist in the best possible way, and having the opportunity to see him engage with other scholars was a truly special opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a very immersive and wide-ranging practicum on interdisciplinary thinking. It involves reading widely in topics and genres including poetry, current events, scientific history, scientific news, sociology, philosophy, and literary scholarship. It also creates a forum for the discussion of this archive among students who come from an equally broad variety of backgrounds and an opportunity to work on very self-directed writing projects. It focuses on the question of what \"Elemental Media\" actually is, and in the process it generates an introduction to the fields of environmental humanities and media philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0This course caused me to look at the environment, weather, and other elemental forces in new ways. I learned to see clouds or weather reports not as mere objects given to us, but as products of or collaborations with our imaginations, prejudices, and ideologies. On a more general level, the course also introduced me to major subfields and theorists within contemporary media theory. ",

            "\u00a0Phenomenal course all around. Professor Peters is a wonderful instructor. Discussions were lively, engaging, informative. The readings were also very interesting and diversemedia theory, environmental philosophy, history, poetry. The only weakness, I think, was the order of the syllabus. I thought we should have started out with cloud/sky media before moving into fire and sea media. I felt like the second half of the syllabus was more engaging than the first (but that could just be my personal taste!). ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in how its subject matter is simultaneously unique and comprehensive. \"Elemental Media\" is not a topic that comes up in many classes, and is difficult to explain, but it touches on so many different areas of study. The meandering, interconnected web-like nature of the class makes it very interesting and leads to unexpected revelations. ",
            "\u00a0The courses strengths are the guest speakers and Professor Peters. Its weakness was that it was somewhat disorganized, but even this gave it a personalized and flexible atmosphere. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the guest speakers were all fantastic, and contributed to the course immensely. I also thought the circular, discussion-based way our seminars were structured was actually helpful when approaching such an indefinable topic. I do think some more foundational readings/discussions early on in the course to establish some context for discussion would've been helpful, before getting into the really fascinating but sometimes difficult object studies/essays. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peters was the greatest strength of this course, since he managed to weave something immensely coherent and satisfying from topics as diverse and seemingly disconnected as cloud computing, Chinese cinema, and the weather. The other students in the class were amazing. Since the syllabus and readings changed as we went on, sometimes it was a little unclear how readings related to the class, but this meandering style was worth it in the endjust have some patience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are its sensitivity to students' interests and needs. Weaknesses are maybe that a few more foundational texts to the course  or phrasing the early readings as foundational  would've helped us know a bit better what we were building on. ",
            "\u00a0This course, by necessity, was not very linear. Since we had four visiting scholars coming at random times through the semester, sometimes each week felt disconnected from what had come before it. However, Professor Peters did such a wonderful job at facilitating the course that it really didn't feel like continuity mattered all that much. The course felt like an open-ended exploration of a set of questions, and as Prof. Peters said at the end, the question of what exactly elemental media even is was best answered by the collective set of our final projects. Overall the course felt like an exciting experiment, which ended up working out way better than it could have in other hands. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the topic of this course, I loved the readings we did on it, and I loved the discussions we had about them. I also loved being able to write papers on subjects within elemental media that aligned to my interests. It was exciting and challenging to read the work of media scholars in anticipation of discussing it with them (during our 5 seminar-lecture-dinner events), though I think this aspect of the course could have been refined: it would have been useful to hear the lectures before coming to our seminar, and in my opinion our class would have responded better to less esoteric visitors. Lisa Parks and Simone Browne were fantastic, and I would model future speaker series on their visit. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the range of its syllabus. Instead of being constricted to one topic or genre, the reading list included everything from works of high theory (e.g. Friedrich Kittler) to poetry. I also appreciated the diversity of professors who spoke to us. Having a digital media theorist, a Chinese film scholar, a historian of climate science, and a specialist on surveillance and government power underscored the courses effort to present elemental media as containing multiple, rather than a singular, perspective.\r\n\r\nOne way that the course could improve would be to tighten seminar discussions. At times, I felt that we meandered a bit too much in class and reiterated points that we had made before. One way to tighten discussion might be to start class by offering two or three theses that people could support/modify/challenge, which would hopefully generate more active conversations. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of my favorite courses at Yale. It made me think in countless new ways. It fundamentally changed my perspective about the natural world and introduced really interesting philosophies of climate change. Such a relevant course! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a rare course that I think would appeal to both STEM and humanities students, especially those who want to branch out beyond their area. Anyone who's interested in exploring and discussing a kind-of new topic would enjoy this class. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class, and I doubt it will ever be quite the same if the speakers and Professor change, but it was very worthwhile and the format was intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0I would! It was a great way for me, a mostly humanities thinker, to reconceptualize climate/the environment, as well as to rethink my own positioning/academic relationship to it. The speakers are an invaluable experience, and one I wish more of my courses could benefit from. Professor Peters is a fantastic instructor, and made the class an intellectually rigorous, friendly space. ",
            "\u00a0While this seminar will probably not be offered again as it existed this semester, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND taking any class with Professor Peters that you can because of how he will challenge you to think creatively and write beautifully and in general be a more thoughtful and curious human being. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a \"front lines\" kinda class. You're really trying to push the field further, which is a worthwhile academic endeavor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100 percent with no reservations. As someone who tends to be turned off by very abstract/theoretical discussions, I at first wondered what I had gotten myself into. But this course is expansive, accessible, joyous, and exciting, mostly because of Prof. Peters. Take anything the man is teaching, you won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student prepared to suspend their skepticism and really consider the idea of elemental media. It definitely requires some hard thinking to understand, but it is a concept that can be made one's own in so many ways and can be taken from there in so many directions. Students with creative open minds and interests in environmentalism, biological science, media studies, film, music, technology, or philosophy will enjoy this course. Students who want to be told what the discipline is and guided firmly through it will not. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if it is once again offered as a Shulman seminar. For English and more humanities-centered students, this courses efforts to bridge the gap between the humanities and science transform how one can look at novels, poems, and other traditional literary forms (e.g. Professor Peters claim that the novel is about weather). For humanities students like myself, the course also brings some much-needed scientific literacy about climate and climate change. For STEM or social-science students, this course offers new approaches to thinking and speaking about the environment. Our discussions on sonification and other alternative ways of presenting climate change, for example, could be of interest to those interested in environmental advocacy. In short, this class has something for everyone, and John Peters friendly demeanor truly invites everyone to participate. ",
