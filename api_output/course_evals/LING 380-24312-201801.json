            "\u00a0I learned about linguistics, neural networks, and machine learning. This is a great introduction to neural networks. ",

            "\u00a0Construction of neural networks ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to program basic neural nets using tensorflow: feedforward, RNN, GRUs, and LSTMs.  Furthermore, you learn how to encode text data for input into these neural nets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the theory behind neural networks and how to implement them in python. The specific linguistic applications of the various networks were also interesting, though what was probably most useful was the wisdom Professor Frank imparted on us about how to approach interpreting the results/output of neural nets. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. I knew nothing about neural networks or linguistics before entering and now feel so confident to continue the exploration. I learned the basics about neural networks, how to use tensorflow, how to use keras, how to develop and set up networks to address problems, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Very thorough overview of the application of neural networks to linguistic tasks. Definitely take this course if you like NLP. Will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I learned soo sooo much about neural networks and the foundations of linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes you from having zero neural network knowledge to being able to understand state-of-the-art computational linguistics research involving neural nets. "

            "\u00a0The lectures were very good! The material is complex, but Professor Frank was great at explaining the content in lecture. The class was supposed to be a seminar, but it ended up being a lecture. The problem sets were a bit tough and the workload was very back-end loaded. ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome! It was very interesting and great way to get to know neural networks and the field of deep learning in general. Professor Frank is really cool and helpful. He really wants everyone to learn and understand what's going on in the class and on the homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0didnt really learn that much about language, i think it could be structured better. we were kind of all over the place with neural nets and language and never really talked about them at the same time in one lecture ",
            "\u00a0I think expanding beyond just a few problem sets would help learn the concepts ",
            "\u00a0This course started off pretty on-track, but seemed to lack direction as the semester went on. Could certainly use some connection between lectures and preparation for the problem sets, which expected a good deal of coding and understanding of CS. ",
            "\u00a0This is a two-hour lecture, which means you are bound to lose focus.  This is, of course, bad in general.  It is especially bad given that there is no clear textbook for the material being covered in lecture.  Also, his lecture notes, in general, are just difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0For its first time being taught, it was well organized (the textbook was good, content progressed in a sensible manner). The assignments could be improved (made more stepwise to explicitly tackle problems of implementing a neural net/analysis prompts more thorough about what was expected from an answer) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are amazingly structured, psets are perfectly spaced out, final project was really conducive to summarizing what we've learned, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe we could have more standardized readings ",
            "\u00a0Very good lectures. Interesting problem sets.\r\n\r\nAssignments could be returned quicker (maybe hire a grader or TA). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Frank is amazing! And he taught everything in a super clear way! Maybe more but shorter psets would be helpful! ",
            "\u00a0This course's main strengths lie in its content: it covers a very narrow field with a surprising amount of breadth, and you walk away with a solid understanding of the neural network techniques you might use to tackle linguistic problems. Several lectures are also devoted to Professor Frank explaining some of his research projects where neural networks were used.  (However, it's important to note that this course is solely designed for linguists.  You can take this course as a CS or data science major and learn a lot of neural nets in general.)  The main weakness of this course was that it was slightly disorganized.  Although this was the first time it was being run and I imagine a lot of wrinkles will be ironed out when the course is offered in the future. "

            "\u00a0I would! This is a good CS elective. You learn some history, some linguistics, and some neural network structures. Pretty fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly recommended. Professor Franks is an amazing teacher and genuinely cares about the students' learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really cool class for anyone interested in neural networks/deep learning. It really helps if you have taken a linguistics class before, a programming class (or have good knowledge of Python), and some linear algebra. If you haven't you'll have to put in the work to catch up. Professor Frank is really good about meeting with students and making sure they understand what's going on. And neural nets are really cool. ",
            "\u00a0i think the class this year was pretty disorganized, maybe wait a few years to take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, but only if you come in with a strong computer science background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Id recommend this course to anyone seeking to gain hands-on experience with neural nets/machine learning, who also likes linguistics and wants something more meaty than NLP with drago. This course feels less survey-y, and is great for taking on what you want/getting what you want out of it (in terms of the ratio between instructor- versus self-guided learning) ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES! AMAZING COURSE AND PROFESSOR FRANK IS LOVELY. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You will learn a lot of interesting and useful stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I already have. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in either linguistics or machine learning, I would strongly recommend taking this course.  It covers plenty of topics that would be interesting to both computer scientists (neural Turing machines, various reccurent neural network architectures, etc.) and linguists (training neural networks to understand agreeement, semantic properties of word embeddings, etc.).  However, while having a strong programming background is not a necessary prerequisite, I would strongly recommend having used Python before this course.  Code written using the libraries used on the problem sets, Numpy and TensorFlow, is _much_ harder to debug without a pretty strong understanding of how Python works. "
