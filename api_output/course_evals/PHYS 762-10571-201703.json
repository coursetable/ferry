            "\u00a0I learned a plethora of machine shop skills. We used both the mill and the lathe. We even learned how to use the CNC. We machined with different materials such as aluminum and brass. ",
            "\u00a0So many practical skills within the machine shop, especially on the mill and the lathe. The instructors were extremely patient and walked us through every step of the fabrication process. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamental understanding about manufacturing techniques and new critical approach to design. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all of the basic operations of machining on mills and lathes, to a high degree of tolerance. Using this knowledge, we were able to build a complete steam engine from scratch. ",
            "\u00a0Using machining tools to fabricate a functional assembly. Thinking about how to approach machining a part and tolerances that are needed. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of machining "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is already very wonderful. I only wish that there was more time to do even more! \r\n\r\nSometimes, organization can be a little bit confused, and while not having pressure to complete the parts was really good, it was also confusing to not know where in the project we were. Having some more explanations of what each part would do at the end at the start of each class might have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is definitely the helpfulness of the content and Dave's experience and patience. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0It's very well organized "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at yale. Dave will teach you just about anything you want to know and then some. As a mechanical engineer, I think this class is necessary for all mech e majors. I think it is an important skill to know how things are made so you can better design them to be machined. ",
            "\u00a0An absolutely fantastic course, taught by an incredible instructor. Nowhere else on campus will you get so much dedicated feedback and come out of every single session feeling like you have accomplished something. Using the mill and lathe, and all of the other tools at the Student Shop, is absolutely exhilarating, and you do end up with a working steam-driven engine at the end of it! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn how to do any machining, for research or for fun, you should definitely take this! Dave is experienced, amazing at teaching, and very patient with mistakes (and everything else). He is an amazing shop instructor and person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would MOST DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. This course is very useful for Mechanical Engineering students as understanding how to machine parts and what the limitations of machinery are are practical skills for the workplace. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn machining "
