            "\u00a0I went from absolutely nothing to being able to cope with certain simple situations speaking only Japanese, a notoriously difficult language. I feel very accomplished. Along with that, the instructors and textbook made sure to include lots of essentials about culture and how it ties in with language. ",
            "\u00a0Holy moly, I learned a whole lot of Japanese--a startling amount for the mere 3.5 months we spent in the classroom. I was able to build upon my study of Chinese to read and write at a higher level than expected, and my speaking and listening went from nothing to something very quickly. Due to the undying support of the senseis, I realized again how much I love learning languages in a classroom environment. "

        [
            "\u00a0The Kanji could have been taught alongside the hiragana from the beginning for people that know Chinese to help us practice what we will eventually have to learn if we continue to learn Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0It's basically perfect (I especially love the new teacher-rotation system; they do a great job with it by keeping everything super organized). My only two complaints are that the media assignments got a little redundant and silly, and that there were a few days where I thought they could have accelerated the pace of the course just a tad. Then again, I like to learn languages hard and fast, and I'd rather go a little slower than be in a room full of suffering language learners. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the strongest point of this course was the support and passion of the senseis. They assign quite a large load of assignments every night (which I felt was just right), and they return the graded work without fail the next day, complete with comments, suggestions, and fun stamps. Most are always open to visits during and outside their office hours, before and after class, during lunch if you see them at TD; it seems no time is a bad time. Feedback is very comprehensive and timely, so you can actually internalize new concepts and correct usage right after youve started the lesson, rather than a week or two later. I think the senseis able to do this because there are six professors for all of L1, so workloads and correcting can be streamlined. Amazing setup.\r\n\r\nThe textbook and course packet pairing is a complicated issue. I appreciate the textbook's (Japanese for Spoken Language) comprehensiveness, but some of the material seems outdated AND the entire book does not use any kana or kanji, which feels restrictive. To make up for this, the professors pair the book with a course packet printed from Tyco. The material is good, but they dont actually include all of the things youll need to have printed out during the semester, so youre consistently having to print out individual sheets and exercises. So watch out - the class right now actually requires you to buy the book, course packet, AND spend money printing almost every day. Luckily I was able to use a friends old textbook, but itd be really expensive if you had to pay for everything. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. It could well be the best elementary Japanese program in the country. ",
            "\u00a0100%. The senseis are so dedicated to your learning, classes are fun and engaging, and the heavy workload is worth it. If you enjoy learning language for the sake of learning language, you will love this class. If you struggle to grasp language concepts or dont enjoy putting time to languages, dont expect an A. Think hard before you sign up. "
