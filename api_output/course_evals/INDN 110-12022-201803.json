            "\u00a0This course is excellent - after 1 semester of Indonesian, I now find myself thinking in Indonesian every now and then. The teaching style of this class facilitates learning and Indonesian 110 is the best language course I have ever taken. ",

I am always excited to go to Indonesian class and see the teachers. ",
