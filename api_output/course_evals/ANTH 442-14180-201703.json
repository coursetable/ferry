            "\u00a0After taking this course, I am leaving with an deeper understanding of ethnography, race, performance and movement, and social justice. The course was very intentional about conversation about ethnographic practices that include the American American experience, and how race plays a role in many sectors. It also utilized the arts, such as various performative movements, in a way that social justice can achieved. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an entirely new lexicon, methodology, praxis, and more from this course. It is truly integral to offerings at Yale College and needs to be continued. Students are able to enter the course honestly and explore connections between how we study anthropology and performance that literally no other course teaches, not even in Theater Studies classes. ",
            "\u00a0Helped think very critically about both theory and method, about the field of anthropology in general and what ethnography really means, both performance ethnography and the entire discipline/method. The confidence to TRY (I feel that isn't encouraged enough at Yale actually). The usual gamut of critical thinking, writing, research, etc. but this course is special in that it truly got me to think outside of certain frames and limitations that usually plague academia. ",
            "\u00a0Applying theory to practice, navigating embodied vs academic praxis, both critiquing and imagining possibilities within ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0Performance Ethnography helped me to understand the ways in which we can conceive of race and culture in relation to performance studies. I learned how to read critical performance studies texts in conversation with anthropological research and was encouraged to create in the midst of all of this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the valuable skills of listening, critical thinking, and moving beyond simply consumuning and regurgitating knowleding towards a constructive synthesis of academic knowledge. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the professor. Professor Cox is one of the most vibrant and comforting professors I have ever had. She was truly about the learning experiences of her students, as opposed to the simple teaching of a course. She was very accommodating of her students' needs and she was inspired by her students, which provided such a close relationship between her and her students. The strengths also included bringing speakers to discuss real world applications and concepts of their work and its relation to performance ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0Readings are sometimes quite inaccessible on your own. When we broke them down in class it was completely fine. We can deal with hard readings. The problem emerged though when we didn't touch a reading so students had struggled for hours and never had any constructive class time around it. Guests are amazing!!!!! Favorite part of the class by far. I appreciated the intro warmup too. Biggest weakness is that it only meets once tbh. ",
            "\u00a0Thought the way the course was changed to meet students' needs was very great, and generative. Guest speakers were also a great component, as were the assignments that had us creating and writing. Only wish we had more time in this course, the time went by too quickly! Perhaps in the future this could be made into a 3 hour course, or if possible, with multiple meetings a week? Or one discussion section and one \"lab\" section? ",
            "\u00a0Honestly a perfect course-- readings were interesting, projects had personal significance rather than just feeling like busywork, seminar discussion was incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely incredible. All of the readings were phenomenal and supplemented by brilliant guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Cox is such a caring professsor and brought so many incredible artists in to speak to us about their work in ways that were always engaging and really inspiring. It was also incredible how she made each of our assignments relevant to us to ensure we felt like we were doing work that mattered to us. I do wish that we used our readings more in class/ engaged with them more deeply though. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! Dr. Cox created individualized mid-terms and finals so there was no such thing as busy-work. Each reading and assignment could be applied towards what was practical for me. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I would recommend this course to other students because there is a way for every individual to obtain benefit from this course. It is very accommodating of so many interests and professional career tracks. Professor Cox is also an excellent professor to teach this course with her extensive experiences and her amazing teaching abilities. The classroom was always a comforting environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Prof. Cox is a new gem of the Anthro department; god knows we'll be lucky if Yale manages to hold onto her... For classes in critical race theory/performance studies/cultural ethnography, she may be the best we have. A must-take, especially for Anthro majors! ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Period. Absolutely take it if you want to have genuine learning about the topics that matter most to you. The course is literally customized for each student. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this course if it is offered again! Fantastic material with lots of encouragement to explore and try, to tackle ideas that don't have clear cut answers. Professor Cox was definitely a highlight of the course, and one of the best professors I've had. What really stood out to me was the level of care and attention she would give to each student (our midterm and final were catered to each students' interests). She is a fantastic discussion leader as well, and the classroom felt like a place of mutual exchange and respect, not overly power-laden and intellectually masturbatory like perhaps some other classes. Assignments were very reasonable workload-wise (a great balance in terms of time put into assignments), and I felt like coursework actually helped me learn things, not just for the purposes of this course or the university, but also beyond the classroom and my time in college. Can't recommend this course, or learning with Professor Cox, highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. Professor Cox is dope. She structures the class around the interests and experiences of students, ensuring the relevance of the material and allowing each voice in the room to be valuable. No matter what you study/are interested in, some aspect of the course will speak to you. One of the best seminars I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Definitely! Definitely! Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really appreciate the work that Professor Cox is doing to bring areas like Performance Ethnography into the anthro department. Prof Cox cares so much about her students and makes it such that you end up doing assignments that really matter to you. ",
            "\u00a0YES! take this course. Professor Cox is a brilliant and caring professor, the material transformed the way I think and brought together many things Ive studied throughout my time at Yale. Also amazing guests to the class thanks to Professor Coxs incredible connections ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to push your creative scholarship, please take this course! I was challenged and greatly rewarded by the guest speakers, class discussions, and personal projects in this course. "
