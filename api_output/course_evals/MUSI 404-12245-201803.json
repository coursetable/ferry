            "\u00a0I learned a bunch of cool analytical tools and also learned to think about not just how to neatly describe music to how to actually go about trying to explain how we hear it ",
            "\u00a0I found the course particularly useful in gaining some language to discuss and think about harmony outside of diatonic contexts, but within a somewhat functional context. In the context of the western art music I know, it seemed like a natural step beyond earlier theory courses. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding and appreciation of the harmonic progressions and schemes used in 19th century music and analytical techniques for diagramming and explaining them (Tonnetz, cube dance, power towers). Works of Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Wagner, and others. Study of chromaticism and meter. Several opportunities to write about music analytically, with a final paper and presentation about a chosen topic. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think it's very well-structured, and Cohn is a master leader of student discussion. I didn't find the presentations at the end of the course particularly useful - I thought we could have used that time learning more material, perhaps more about late 19th-century analysis and more complicated forms. ",
            "\u00a0Not going to sugar-coat it, this class is a LOT of work--possibly more than any other course I've taken at Yale so far. You have 5 essays and a final paper, which, word count wise, are very manageable. That being said, the analysis and graph making for each short paper takes many, many, hours. A good estimate is that it will take you 10 hours to analyze the piece, 2 hours to do the graphs, and 2-4 hours to write the essay itself. This may not seem like a lot, but keep in mind that all 5 essays are assigned within the first 7-8 weeks of class. This means that for the first half of the semester, you will be spending loads of time for this class. However, this class is why I came to Yale.  You will learn a ton and will apply years of musical training to this class so overall its a great feeling. Richard Cohn is also fantastic, nevermind that he basically invented many of the areas that you'll study. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed very strong as it is; I thought the balance of occasional lectures on analytical tools with frequent discussions of pieces was helpful, especially given the regular preparatory assignments given ahead of discussions. I also thought the frequent smaller papers were useful in interacting with the content as it was presented - and it was nice that a lot of the papers came early in the semester when I didn't have a lot of work (and that there was a lot of time to write the final paper). ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of ground in an era with so much happening. Many different uses of chromaticism, and brief coverage of form and meter as well. The music we studied was always compelling and drawn from many composers and parts of the 19th century. The writing assignments had a variety of interesting topics, and the final paper gave me a chance to delve into a piece I was interested in and learn from each of my classmates. I would have appreciated more guidance early on as to how to approach the writing assignments, as I had never written an analytical music theory paper before. We read some pieces by other professors in the field but I think previous student submissions would have been even more helpful. I also wish we could have studied 19th century choral music - unfortunately I do not recall doing this even once in the course. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course teaches you all kinds of things you don't learn in earlier music theory classes - how to deal with ambiguities in music, how to make an argument for a particular hearing and find evidence to support it, etc. The models and modes of analysis taught in the class are awesome and truly expanded my ability to think about music beyond the standard Roman numeral context. Cohn is an expert mediator of discussion - he manages to keep the conversation focused and hit on the salient points he wants to investigate while saying surprisingly little. He's also unbelievably knowledgeable in his field and picks genuinely interesting pieces to study. ",
            "\u00a0This class is easier if you really excelled in Music 211 and if you have great ear training. Know yourself before you sign up. If you are a person who can listen to three chords and then immediately know what they are functionally then you are in pretty good shape. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you like music theory, you will enjoy this course and learn a ton. The five papers (along with small assignments due in between classes) make the workload greater than that of MUSI 210 or 211, but it's worth it. "
