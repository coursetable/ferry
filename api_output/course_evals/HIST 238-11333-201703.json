            "\u00a0A very specific point, but one I thought worth conveying: Some of the most interesting comments Professor Pincus made during lecture were about the canonical historiography of the events we were considering. This, of course, makes sense, given Prof. Pincus' challenging of many of the long-accepted arguments in those works. I understand that this is a history courseand not a historiography courseand that Prof. Pincus has an obligation to get through a certain amount of historical \"content,\" but I would have enjoyed more discussion of the factors that influenced the writing of the narratives he spends so much time challenging. Why did former scholars see the past in these (apparently incorrect) ways? ",
            "\u00a0The course is a very thorough overview and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The lack of a TF was a definite weakness. While Pincus is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic and was nice enough, section with him was not ideal. He knows too much about the topic to accurately gauge what students baseline background knowledge is. This is also reflected in the course readings. While primary source readings are certainly important, the course sells itself as a bit of a survey course, so many students won't necessarily have the prerequisite knowledge to understand why the primary sources he's selected are important or even to understand what they're saying (The King Philip's War reading, for example, was honestly incomprehensible to me). The class needs a TF. Barring that, it needs Pincus to facilitate a discussion about the readings, rather than just interrogating students about details.The readings definitely need to be altered, preferably to a more realistic level and with more secondary sources. Overall though, the lectures were pretty great, although a bit less reading directly off the slides would be good. "

            "\u00a0This is a solid course. Pincus can be a bit dogmatic, but he really knows his stuff, and the course was very accessible to a history major with no background in the region/period. Take it if you need a preindustrial credit and want to challenge some of your preconceptions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - Pincus is fantastic and this is a good way to learn about American history in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I was probably partially disappointed because I came in expecting a class on the British Empire would focus on Britain's colonies and instead found a class extremely focused on English history/domestic politics, but this class just didn't really excite me. Pincus is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and the material is in general pretty interesting (although the class on English industrialization was honestly the most boring lecture I've ever sat through and I took Econ 115), but the way he lectures is not particularly enjoyable. He mostly just reads directly off the slides too quickly for you to actually take notes. The course was also too small to have a TF, but Pincus wanted to have section so he taught it himself. The section was essentially him interrogating us about the details of the numerous unintelligible or irrelevant primary source readings for the week. The reading load is pretty heavy some weeks, and without a pretty solid baseline understanding of English/British imperial history, all the primary source readings are hard to get through. Overall, I definitely learned some interesting things, and he gave me a really different perspective on empire than a lot of other courses have given me, but it's definitely not a class that inspires a lot of excitement about going to lecture. The grading is honestly pretty easy, but it doesn't feel particularly fulfilling. Would definitely recommend to anyone with a real interest in political economy, but it that's not you it's definitely not a must-take. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it offers an entirely new perspective on British imperial history. "
