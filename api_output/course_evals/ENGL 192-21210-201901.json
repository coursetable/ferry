            "\u00a0Learning about the world, film terms, camera shots ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of cinema in different regions of the world, as well as how to critically analyze films. This was quite valuable for me because I used to feel uncomfortable discussing films  taking this class really helped me gain familiarity and comfort with film criticism. ",
            "\u00a0How to consider the history of the time period the film and the director's history into interpreting a film's message. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a knowledge about film from all across the world and in many different languages and from different time periods. We learned about genres of film and how they have evolved over time. We did a deep study into one region of Cinema. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically and analyze film; both from a close (analytical) and a more general perspective (how cinema fits in with history). ",
            "\u00a0A different approach to viewing cinema. "

            "\u00a0Too much time spent on history, more film analysis please ",
            "\u00a0The films we watched were excellent, as were some of the lectures. Section discussions sometimes felt less relevant and there were a few lectures  including one 50-minute lecture on women's cinema, the gist of which seemed to be that there exists at least one intelligent female film director (!!)  that were distinctly less enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were disorganized and difficult to follow. However, the syllabus was incredible and the films selected were very well picked ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely fantastic! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Marta and Dudley are a dream team and their lectures are always highly provocative. I learned so much about film generally and analytically and I have a richer perspective on things because of it. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if lectures were slightly more \"roadmapped:\" it's hard to know what to pay attention to, and lots of information is given, making it hard to take notes. Perhaps more detailed powerpoints would be helpful? ",
            "\u00a0The sections were amazing from the films viewings to the discussions. The lectures could be better if the notes that the professors used were also uploaded or if there was that was written on the slides. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great intro to world cinema, an overall introduction to the concept and a good start point for people who want to learn more about films from different parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe workload of the course could have been made more clear at the beginning of the semester, especially because there wasn't much of a difference between the amount of work for people taking the class as a WR credit or not, and for people not interested in taking it as a WR credit, the writing assignments were more demanding than a lot of the WR classes at Yale.\r\n\r\nAlso the class requires longer than 50 minutes, which was proven by the fact that we finished late almost every single class. I believe a more interactive class setting with a longer period would be a lot more helpful, instead of shorter class periods and a section that meets after the screening, which has not been very engaging due to its time - it was hard to maintain the energy for a discussion that late in the evening after a day of classes + a screening. Besides, I believe that interacting directly with the professor/s would give the students a chance to ask more questions and hence start more interesting discussions in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this as an introductory course for anyone who is interested in film. The films on the syllabus are excellent and thoughtfully selected to give students wide exposure to global cinemas, and the instructors are also very helpful in guiding students to talk critically about cinematography and film as a medium. ",
            "\u00a0MUST take!! All the films everyone needs to have seen but that nobody often gets to. Besides that, an eye-opening cultural experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It expands your horizon of knowledge regarding important films that changed different world perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0If you are okay with writing and weekly screenings then yes go for it. The workload was more than expected for a non-WR class. It is also quite disorganized and the expectations were not made very clear, but the films are interesting and cool and the professors were very knowledgable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Whether or not you study film, or english, this course is highly engaging and there is a lot to learn. The section discussions were thought-provoking and the lectures were always eye-opening . ",
            "\u00a0It's fairly low-key, but difficult to know what to pay attention to in class. It takes up a fair amount of time because of the films, but also it's nice to tell yourself \"I'm doing work\" while you're watching movies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it requires minimal engagement and the material is quite interesting if you're interested in film in any way. "
