Also, this course could use a textbook, the lecture slides are not comprehensive enough as a substitute. ",

I really liked this as other econ prereqs at Yale were more theoretical, while in this class we can actually apply what we learned to analyze real world data. Weaknesses: some concepts could be better explained. They're not hard to grasp, but it just needs to be explained more clearly. ",

Interesting problem sets that use real data to make calculations about interesting topics (socioeconomic makeup of university students, inequality of access to higher education, voting statistics, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tests never checked our understanding of R. While this means the tests were easier, it feels weird to have such a distinction in the material covered on the exams and the material covered in psets (which were usually about 2/3 R, 1/3 hand-calculations). I also think more time should have been spent teaching student how to use R; many psets relied heavily on students using functions we've never heard of to answer questions we don't understand. ",

It was also very clear in its descriptions of statistical concepts.\r\n\r\nIts only real weaknesses were in two areas. First, I would have liked if there was a much stronger focus on economics concepts. Aside from the specific research papers we used for raw data, this course could have simply been called Intro to Statistics rather than Econometrics. Secondly, it could have been more interesting with a stronger focus on using R. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be really difficult. While Professor Humphries cared a lot and tried his best, I think, it was really hard to understand concepts in class, and attending lecture didn't help me much more at all than just reading the slides. I think it's kind of an unnecessary course for the major, and I especially thought the fact that we had to do coding ridiculous. ",

The material was presented in a way that complicated rather simple concepts. If you have a background in Statistics you automatically have a huge advantage in the class because that was basically the only thing the first midterm tested. This class does not facilitate learning at all. Horrible experience. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved with a more put-together professor. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that in addition to learning about probability rules, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and linear regressions, we also learned how to code in R (a programming language for statistical computing). Most of the pset problems were about the topics we learned in lecture, but we had to use R to solve them. Computer science is such an important skill to know in the 21st century, and is used in almost every career field. We did not have to memorize how to write code for the exams, but we did use R for the homework. I also liked how at the weekly sections with the TAs, the TAs would go over useful R functions for the week so that we were very prepared to do the pset problems. For example, at a section, we might go over how to construct a confidence interval using R. For our pset, we would then construct a confidence interval by ourselves. ",

            "\u00a0The class material was often very complicated. When looking over some of the material in the slides, it was often very difficult to understand. However, it was rarely tested in its purest form. I would recommend emphasizing the basic concepts more, doing more sample problems in class, making sure there were more test style questions on PSets, etc. and only then focus on the more difficult material. I think that would have given me a better foundational knowledge of stats. \r\n\r\nFor strengths, I think the class material was always very interesting. Prof. Humphries is a really nice guy and always willing to help. I thought the PSets were  actually fairly useful. If you actually give the class your focus, you will learn a lot about R that can be very useful in internships, etc. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that it used data from papers that are currently very relevant in academic today, and it kind of took us into the minds of the researchers by teaching us how to come to the same conclusions that the researchers did using their data. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a huge amount of material in a short time. As a result, the professor skips from slide to slide extremely quickly in lecture, going through about 45-60 slides a lesson, which makes it difficult to follow. Furthermore, since many of the PSETs are focused on developing R-skills, which are not tested in exams, there is little practice of the actual math material which is tested during exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was the level of engagement Mr Humphries had with the class. He would answer questions diligently and work hard to make sure we understood the material. ",

Lowest pset grade is dropped. There are also quizzes, but you have a 24 hour time allowance + open note, so it's pretty chill. Tests are fair, and you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet. Make sure you have a solid grasp of the concepts, as that's what shows up on tests/quizzes, while Psets are mainly coding based.
