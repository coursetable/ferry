            "\u00a0A strict composition schedule is so, so, so valuable. Even if you rush to finish things and end up hating 75% of everything you write for the class, building up the discipline to sit down and write every week is essential. And weekly feedback is extremely helpful in getting you out of your head when you're writing. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to practice and refine my musical theatre lyric and music writing abilities in an open and collaborative setting. I never felt judged by my peers, but the quality of their work was a great motivator. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what I'm good at and what I'm familiar with in composition and how to accentuate those ideas. I also learned a lot about where I can push myself to differentiate my work to create a lot of different sounds and express many ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I developed really clear insight on how to write effectively for characters in varying situations. I was also given a space to experiment harmonically, thematically, and structurally in a way I had never been able to do before. It's very hard in this class not to improve because you are constantly challenged in this class to write in a different way. The class has a really strong emphasis on making sure the songs are character-driven-- which something that I definitely gained during the course of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing for a specific character/voice, how to make a song escalate in its drama steadily, such that the character ends up in a different place from where he/she began, strengthened my music notation skills, worked in collaboration with other composers, received constructive feedback on how I might improve dramatic arc, lyrics, musical/harmonic diversity or \"freshness\", etc. ",
            "\u00a0I had the opportunity to develop my songwriting skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the conventions of song structure, character arcs, and notation for musical theater composition. I was able to learn different harmonic techniques and rhyme structure from other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great practice in writing MT (and other types of) songs. We discussed, through class feedback, what makes particular lyrics/structures/etc. more successful than others. ",
            "\u00a0Hyper and constructive self-critique in songwriting. An invaluable skill. "

            "\u00a0The course works so well as a workshop format and Scott is super great. It could definitely be improved by a smaller class size (meaning more time per person spent receiving feedback). It could also be improved by Scott sending assignments a little earlier in the week so we have time to plan. ",
            "\u00a0This course, as many of others in the music department and the Shen curriculum, would be better with a more diverse group of students. The class was all male this semester and almost exclusively white. The structure of the class is great, the professor is great, and the environment of the classroom is positive, but it would be improved so much by having more diverse ideas and sounds and personalities and perspectives in the room.\r\nThere are times when it can feel like class time gets disproportionately spent on certain students. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really ensemble-based. You are learning from your peers and from the instructor at the same time because everyone gives and gets feedback. That was a huge strength for the course, in my opinion, because it made the class not competitive at all. The assignments were also very diverse with just enough specificity to be cogent but also broad enough to yield tons of different takes on the same assignment. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that sometimes you get assignments less than a week before they are due and because of that you have to budget your time in a big way. ",
            "\u00a0Truly a great experience all around. Everyone in the room was very kind, supportive, and constructive. Everyone wrote/brought in a song every week, and it was phenomenal to see how each composer responded in such a different way to the same prompt. Sometimes we had to rush/cut short our discussion of a song to make sure we fit everybody in when I would've liked to dive in deeper. Not sure if much can be done about that though. Still, each composer received a significant amount of feedback from everyone in the room each week. Very strong class overall. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed discussing my work with my peers and Scott ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun environment, Scott is a great Professor, collaborative assignments, relevant and engaging assignment topics, Scott is open to thinking outside the box\r\nWeaknesses; one-on-one feedback isnt really accessible in person, its a little too long (2.5 hours sometimes), assignments get sent out too late ",
            "\u00a0This class was great practice for me--it forced me to write one song per week, which was invaluable. I wish that we had more varied, focused assignments. Although some of the feedback I received over the term was consistent, and I was able to incorporate a lot of it into my future writing, some of it was so specific to the song that it was hard to apply it to the rest of my work. Obviously, specific feedback is incredibly important and helpful, but more general feedback would also be useful. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! Put in the work, you will get so much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seriously interested in songwriting of any capacity, whether for theatre or otherwise. It's probably not a hobbyist's class, but for anyone with long-term career goals in songwriting, this is a great class to learn from Scott and from your peers about how to craft a musical theatre lyric with music that supports and elevates it - and the structure of a musical theatre lyric will inform any kind of lyric writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class to work the composition muscle. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend. The course is a lot of fun and you learn so much from your peers in the class and the professor. Although, the course's setup is that you present your work in front of the class and get feedback. So, if you don't put in the effort, the feedback won't be as meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a student who has an interest in either composing for musical theater or songwriting in general, with at least some experience in songwriting/composing who would like to improve upon his/her preexisting knowledge/skills. Nowhere else will you get the chance to be in a room with some top-notch composers and musicians who will always listen with open ears and help you to be the best you can be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But you have to put in a lot of work every week to make it worth it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in musical theater composition, Scott is a genius and he gives such clear feedback based on years of experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a lot of work but I found it to be fun and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a composer, you should take this class. If you are a songwriter, you should definitely take this class. If you are a composer of musical theater, you absolutely must take this class. "
