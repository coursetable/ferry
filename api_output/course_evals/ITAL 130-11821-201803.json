            "\u00a0The material was pretty much the same as L1/L2, but I gained better conversation skills. ",
            "\u00a0L3 really helped synthesize all the information I learned in L1 and L2. Its primarily based on reviewing all grammar concepts and learning new vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0Essentially a review of grammar from L1 and L2 Italian with a lot of extra vocabulary (~750 words) thrown in. Great exposure to Italian culture through short stories, short and full length films, and other forms of literature. I felt that this class reinforced my grammar skills enough to maintain an okay conversation in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more conversational Italian rather than just structure. ",
            "\u00a0Got a lot better at Italian, both speaking and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I think my Italian may have gotten worse because of this class. ",

            "\u00a0I progressed in my knowledge of Italian and developed better reading, writing and speakings kills. ",
            "\u00a0I continued learning the fundamentals of the Italian language and culture but repetitive study, practice, and review of concepts learned in L1 and L2. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak more fluently in a conversational setting and how to understand more tenses and vocabulary related to different industries and concepts surrounding Italian. I also grew better at talking about political and social issues in Italian and how there are similarities and differences between the US and Italy in terms of corruption, economics, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I further learned about intermediate things in the Italian language. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to speak multiple tenses and a large amount of grammatical structures and vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0A stronger grasp on the Italian language with a focus on speaking and generating complex new ideas. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - great professor ",
            "\u00a0Michael is an amazing professor - extremely kind and interested in the success of his students. Daily quizzes are a pain, but they're not graded stringently and force you to engage with the material before coming to class. With that being said, I was really disappointed by the material in L3 Italian. It moved extremely slowly, and I don't think that I learned anything new other than vocabulary and one verb tense. I felt like I would go home, study for the quizzes, and accomplish very little in class. I would have liked for the curriculum to have moved a lot faster / covered more material. I think that this would've also helped keep students engaged in class: there were some people who simply didn't offer much in discussions and were visibly disinterested. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed being in Michael Farinas class again. He is always a joy to learn from. There happened to be a lot of students in the class this semester however and it made engaging harder. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - structure, instruction\r\nWeakness - inconsistent difficulty of tests ",
            "\u00a0Very easy course and great for anyone trying to finish their language requirement. The conceit of this course seems to make it totally unnecessary. It is about 95% review of L1 and L2, which just doesn't seem that important to me. ",
            "\u00a0Very fun. The class was very excited to be there everyday and willing to contribute ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be well laid out with a balanced syllabus. The last two weeks were crammed, but other than that everything went well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the group work and how open discussions were in terms of getting everyone involved while improving in their Italian and how it recaps major topics, so the most important fundamentals of Italian are mastered. Weaknesses are only that instruction could be a little more hands on at times, as second languages can be hard to grasp in terms of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher was incredible, workload was fine, classmates were awesome. I think one way to better this class could be through more guest speakers to talk about the Italian culture. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Farina is amazing ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well designed and the curriculum was challenging yet engaging. The professor was phenomenal. Ti amo Michael! ",
            "\u00a0This course was probably the most fun and engaging one Ive ever had at Yale. It was a big class which made it what it was but perhaps that made less time for each person to practice speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Farina's passion for the language and for teaching us to use it in practical contexts. His explanations and humors made the course incredibly exciting on a day-to-day basis which is no small feat.\r\nThe use of multimedia experiences to learn the language; namely films and the trip to the museum was amazing! More out-of-the-classroom experiences, though difficult to organize, could be great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course progression through the textbook was very imbalanced; this is independent of whether the textbook is good or bad -- rather, the timing of how we went through the textbook was impractical. Sections in the book are very unequal in the content they cover (e.g., \"Ci and ne\" versus the imperfect tense). To treat all sections equally when the content they cover is highly variable in terms of difficulty seemed like a major oversight, even for a course that was review for most.\r\nThe class section was very big; I think due to the fact that Professor Farina is very popular with students. This was a major weakness.\r\nSome students may be more passionate about the language than others (given that it is part of college language requirements) which sometimes can made the class environment difficult to manage.

            "\u00a0Yes. I wouldn't take it with any other professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend L3. Since its mostly review, the challenge of learning new grammar is basically removed ",
            "\u00a0If you need to finish your language requirement, want a refresher on grammar, or want to take a fairly relaxed class, absolutely. The Italian department at Yale is wonderful - all of the instructors are incredibly caring and friendly (especially Michael). If you're looking to be challenged or care a lot about knowing your grade, probably not. I personally really enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course, although moreso because of my professor. Im not sure how much I would recommend it under another professor, but under Michael Farina I would tell anyone to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes with Professor Farina - he is an extraordinary impactful and caring teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you just want to finish your Italian requirement and don't care much about the language. The professor teaches a very relaxed class and enjoys just having whole class conversations (which, more than anything, just take up time). Very few assignments and relatively easy assessments if you felt comfortable in L1 and L2. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the Italian department is great. The teachers are passionate and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to learn more about the Italian culture and continue to practice language skills. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely just because of how beautiful both the language and culture are and the Italian teachers here do a wonderful job of preparing you to speak in a fluid, proper manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is essentially a continuation of L1 and L2 to help you polish the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely recommend. Great way to get exposure to the Italian culture and language ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I recommend Italian to everyone. The department is phenomenal and I plan on taking more even though I'm done with the language requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. So much fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend the course and Professor Farina to another student. "
