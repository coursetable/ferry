            "\u00a0I mostly learned about how naked-eye astronomy works. Lots about the movement about the sun, the moon, and the stars. I also learned how the astronomy of ancient civilizations was developed. The course is advertised as being also quite anthropological, but don't be fooled there is very little anthropology. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about celestial observations and how cultures before the telescope (pre-Galileo) understood their relationship to the heavens. Astronomy is a beautiful, captivating field, and Professor Faison is a brilliant and passionate scholar of the subject. I did not, however, learn about what I thought I'd learn about. I thought this course -- based on the syllabus and how Professor Faison described its mission -- would be similar to an anthropology class. I expected us to focus on the human element of astronomy; I was extremely excited about it. This did not end up being the case for most of the semester. We only focused on the human element toward the end, instead spending most of the semester doing calculations and estimations with numbers and figures. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of the cycles of the motions of the planets, the sun and the moon, and the stars, which I had never really understood before. I learned how to read an astrolabe, calibrate a sundial, navigate by the stars, use the Stellarium simulator, and other cool skills as well. "

            "\u00a0I think the small lecture style is very conducive to learning the material, and the lectures themselves were always very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the material failed to interest me ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is the complete lack of feedback and the fact that even if you go to class and pay attention there is no way to be prepared for the homework or the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great!  Professor Faison was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Faison is an engaging lecturer, and he is clearly passionate about the subject. The problem sets are very reasonable and clear, and are good at reinforcing what is discussed in class. Also, the final paper is actually pretty cool; getting to dive into research about a specific topic in astronomy and culture ends up being quite interesting, and is definitely preferable to a final. \r\n\r\nMy main problem with the class is that the exams are not well organized  there should absolutely be more practice problems and sample exams. In general, the class does have a specific textbook or curriculum to refer to, so studying for the tests is frustrating when it shouldn't be. \r\nAlso, and this is crucial for student engagement, the lectures should not include lists of 20 ancient astronomers no one is going to remember them, and they are not interesting. Having lecturers more focused on 2-4 key astronomers and their ideas would be way more effective, and would make it easier to have a sense of the curriculum when preparing for tests.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is no follow through on the anthropological side of the class  just saying that the lunar calendar was important to Arabic astronomers because of Ramadan does not constitute anthropology. We could be thinking about whether it is more important to study original intention or use through time of astronomical structures, or thinking about comparing calendars of civilizations in regards to political intent. Something with more meat to it, instead of just implying a cultural reason for an astronomical thing. \r\n\r\nAlso, I recognize Professor Faison had a baby during the semester so this might not be regular, but we really should have grades and feedback on any of  our relevant problem sets before we take a midterm on the material covered in them. The lack of feedback before the second midterm was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Lessons could be more comprehensive and orderly ",
            "\u00a0This course frustrated me a great deal throughout this past semester. My main criticism is this: the course, while interesting, is not what it advertises itself to be. The syllabus insists that the class will focus on human beings and how they interacted with the sky before use of the telescope became widespread. We didn't actually do that until the later meetings of the course. For most of the semester, we worked with numbers and figures, doing calculations, estimating values, and the like. While I appreciate the value in that, it wasn't what I was looking for in my science course, and, having decided to take the course based on the syllabus and the first few days of class (which is the most anyone can do), I felt deceived by what we actually ended up doing in the class. I think the course could be made much better (and much more appealing to non-STEM majors looking to fulfill a science credit) if its focus were more on human beings. We should be doing more social and historical study, and fewer calculations.\r\n\r\nWe also did not receive much feedback on our work. We typically did not receive grades on our problem sets until at least 4-5 weeks after we turned them in. Once we did receive a grade, we only got a grade for the problem set as whole, and not for specific problems. Based on the grade alone, it was impossible to know what you'd done wrong if you'd done poorly on the problem set.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I had virtually no idea what was going to be on either of the exams we took. We did not ever explicitly discuss what topics would be on an exam until the last class before that exam, when we would do a few practice questions. In both instances, I found that the practice questions we did were not actually reflective of what the exam was like. We would cover massive amounts of material in every lecture, but only a very small amount of it would show up on the test, and it was impossible to know which pieces of material this would be. Because of all of this, I found it extremely difficult to make myself adequately prepared for the exams, no matter how much I studied. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting, but the course itself felt pretty disorganized. We had to cut material from the syllabus due to time constraints and many lectures went off on (albeit interesting) tangents that slowed things down a bit. I would have appreciated more class discussion among students, especially during the more culturally focused part of the course. "

            "\u00a0No, there are plenty of other courses that students could learn more from and have a better experience in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is at all interested in the practical aspects of astronomy, or who wants to know more about its historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I would and have recommended this course to numerous people. Approaching the course as a humanities major who dreads the sciences, this class offered a great opportunity to blend astronomy with history/almost anthropology. I found the material truly fascinating and the lectures engaging. ",
            "\u00a0NO. Do NOT take this course. It is not a GUT. Professor Faison is a nice guy but the tests were impossible and the homework was bizarely hard. There was no way to be prepared. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an interesting survey of the use of naked-eye astronomy in different cultures and its developments. The first half of the semester is the basics of naked-eye astronomy whereas the second is more cultural. The weekly problem sets seem like busy work and you just have to find answers within readings for the most part. Faison  was incredibly slow at grading problem sets (by the end of the semester he only graded four of ten psets). The exams and all the work were fair and it was an easy science credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would! It was a very interesting science class.  The observation exercises were very fun. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in naked-eye astronomy and the way the ancients thought about it, you should take this course. It is also a fine science credit more quantitative than it seems, and less anthropological that it is described as, but not super difficult and relatively interesting. Hopefully there is more clear feedback for problem sets and more sample midterms in future years, since that would make the exams much less frustrating to study for. Having a final paper is also way more interesting and less stressful than having a final exam, so that is a bonus. The psets are not bad, and the observing exercises are pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0I would hesitate to recommend this course to another student. If you're a humanities-type person, and you're reading the syllabus, you might think, \"Finally, the science class I've been looking for! A class that focuses on human society and interaction!\" Archaeoastronomy in the abstract has the potential to be that class. Unfortunately, that's not what this class was -- for most of the semester, at least. We only studied human cultures in earnest during the last few weeks of the semester. For most of the course, we did lots of numerical work, which is specifically what I was looking to avoid. Additionally, very little feedback is given in this class. We usually didn't get grades back on our psets until a month or more after they were turned in, and even then, there was simply a grade given on the whole pset. No individual grading on any of the specific problems, so you could never really know where you went wrong or how to improve. \r\n\r\nProfessor Faison is an enthusiastic, passionate professor who shows his love for astronomy every day. Nonetheless, this class isn't what it advertises itself to be, and it has some big problems. If you're a humanities-oriented person looking for a science credit, this class will frustrate you. I'd recommend checking out some other options before committing to Archaeoastronomy. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a pretty easy SC credit and good for students interested in the intersection between science and culture. Mixes practical astronomical material with historical and anthropological material in a really interesting way. The course is transitioning from a lecture to a seminar, which translated into some disorganization. "
