I saw compliments and then an A- or B+, and three of the five were graded after the last lecture of the semester.\r\nThe TF was probably symbolic and was just as confused about discussions on canvas as the professors and students.\r\nThe Canvas discussions added little value to the course and were never consistent in where they were located. I didn't do them sometimes because of that reason.\r\nPlease be more organized or don't try to add complexity if you can't grade it. ",
