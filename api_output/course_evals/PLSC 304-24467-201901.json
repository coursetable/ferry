            "\u00a0A great class that helps you to understand the Ethics of Business and the legal parameters that surround them.  You will learn about a lot of different types of scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about share/stakeholder theory, case studies, and business ethics in the context of today's world with real life examples ",
            "\u00a0In this fantastic seminar, I gained a lot of knowledge about the fundamental principles of business ethics and developed my legal reading skills. Prior to PLSC 304, there weren't many opportunities to read so many legal documents that we would then talk about for the entire seminar. It allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these readings and I came back to every seminar wanting to talk for more time than we had. ",
            "\u00a0It is an insightful class that gave me a good overview of different law cases, using the toolsets of stakeholder and stockholder theory. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about several of the important topics at the intersection of business, ethics, and law. ",
            "\u00a0This course tackled the basic theories and ethical concepts core to running and managing a corporation. We learned how to approach corporate ethics from the perspectives of various theories like shareholder theory and stakeholder theory, and discussed such topics as fiduciary duty, insider trading, pricing discriminating, etc. "

            "\u00a0Very chill class.  Professor Landis is amazing and allows the conversation to flow in whatever direction is natural, so it is very y much a student-led seminar -- and the workload is pretty light. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and had interesting readings of various kinds which was great. If we spent more time on virtue theory and had more case studies, I would've enjoyed the case even more but I like the way it is set up in a free-flowing fashion ",
            "\u00a0Professor Landis has done an incredible job setting this seminar up and the only weakness I could think of would be to have a practice midterm exam or set of practice questions, so we could come to the midterm with even more confidence and preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course is extremely well organized, and the readings really helped to frame the class objectives as well. The class was not intimidating, and I felt like I could contribute to the class even if I did not have a background in the subject area like some of my classmates did. I did not feel like I was competing in the course, and, as such, my classmates and I were able to work together to understand the material better. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally, class discussions became off-topic (not way out in left field off-topic though). That is not unique to Professor Landiss class though, as all seminars are prone to this. I was a little bit frustrated with virtue theory, as I didnt understand it completely. Im not sure if I would recommend cutting it, but maybe spending more time on it, especially Aristotelian thought? ",
            "\u00a0It it a great class for discussion ",
            "\u00a0Readings were mostly quite good and the course incorporated a variety of theories. Discussions were somewhat monotonous, distant from the texts, and frequently came back to the same central questions. Maybe make it twice a week and vary the syllabus a little more? ",
            "\u00a0Professor Landis was great! So kind and respectful to all of us. Except for a few core unavoidable readings, the material was also just so interesting that it wasn't as much of a drag as in other classes to do readings. But the biggest strength: This class is just so RELEVANT to what we face everyday as consumers and what we will face in our future careers. ",
            "\u00a0PLSC 304 was one of the highlights of my semester. It's a very discussion-heavy seminar, and Prof. Landis structures every course to be centered around student conversation with him providing guiding questions and topics of discussion. You don't have to be a Poli Sci major to be invested in the course, and I think it's major strength is how much every class is carried through student discourse. "

            "\u00a0Take this class, it's a super chill seminar, very relaxed grading, and a ton of fun.  You will learn and actually enjoy yourself. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class teaches you about business ethics which is vital to know in multiple fields and is done so in a very collaborative and low-stress way ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any political science, EP&E, law, or even economics student at Yale. The course never felt like a chore and was always one of the highlights to my week. The readings throughout the course kept me extremely engaged with the seminar as I genuinely enjoyed each of the readings we had. If you do take the seminar, make sure that you do as many of the readings as possible, because it will allow you to get so much information out of the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I learned so much about many facets of business ethics . My final paper also allowed me to explore an area of business ethics that I had not contemplated before. Professor Landis is brilliant, witty, and has the occasional dry sense of humor that gives him a human touch. The readings never felt burdensome, and they added to the value of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course as an EPE selective ",
            "\u00a0yes, it covers fascinating and thought provoking material. While it can certainly be improved, I am definitely appreciative of the new perspectives the course gave me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class really makes you rethink a lot about how business permeates and affects so much of history and society, and all the right, wrong, and not so clear cut business decisions that companies have made and should/should not make going forward. Class discussion always flowed really well because of the importance of the issues we talked about. So important to start the conversation around business ethics before heading out into our career! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. "
