            "\u00a0This class provided an in-depth analysis of the theories of many different philosophers. I learned how to evaluate and refute arguments, understand view points that contradicted my own, and think critically about the body and mind. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to more effectively approach (read and analyze) contemporary philosophical papers. ",
            "\u00a0A ton!! It was my first philosophy course and a great introduction to philosophy of the mind. I learned about a broad range of topics in traditional and modern philosophy that pertain to theory of mind. My writing also got much better - Prof. Szabo is very precise about word choice and word use, so I learned how to avoid writing in vague terms and how to get my concept across directly and clearly.

            "\u00a0This class was a strong class, easy to follow and not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed reading an interesting selection of influential papers as a way of getting the lay of the land, so to speak. ",
            "\u00a0The size of this class was perfect and made it really rewarding. Professor Szabo was amazing and everyone in the class was really engaged in what we learned and discussed. All the material we covered was very relevant and flowed well throughout the course. Assignments were just right in terms of number and length, such that the workload of this course was very manageable but still engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: PowerPoints & class lectures were incredibly clear and helped to develop a better understanding of the course material. Readings were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the readings were difficult to synthesize before classthis was always resolved through the lectures, but maybe a quick understanding of the texts context would be helpful to have before completing reading "

            "\u00a0A very solid course if you're interested in philosophy of mind. My year, the class was mostly cogsci/neuro/psych students, so don't be shy about taking it even if philosophy isn't your thing. The class is organized as lectures, but it was pretty small and Prof. Szabo encourages everyone to participate, so you're not just sitting silently and taking notes the whole time. Assignments and grading are very fair and manageable: 6 reading responses (each approx. 2 pages 1.5-spaced) and a final exam (in-class essays, prompts given beforehand). Interesting readings, and a good, thorough introduction to philosophy of mind. ",
            "\u00a0If the student had an interest in philosphy and a genuine curiosity for the subject matter, yes. If not, no. This class is definitely better if you want to be there. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0Yes; a great introduction to topics in the philosophy of mind ",
            "\u00a0HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Professor Szabo is amazing and if you get the chance to learn from him you are very lucky. This course was engaging, very informative, had a manageable workload, and gave me a great introduction to theory of mind and consciousness. The class is small and taught in a lecture, but everyone is so engaged in the material which makes it really interesting. We often would stop class to go on philosophical tangents about applications of what we were learning. I thought I hated philosophy and was scared of it before I took this class, and now I want to take more of it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in cog sci, analytic philosophy, psychology, or any other field that touches on philosophy of mind. However, it is not particularly challenging so it would be best for someone who has a limited background. "
