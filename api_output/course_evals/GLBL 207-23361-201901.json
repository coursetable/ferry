I particularly appreciated that the course covered a series of movements, events, and developments that are often not discussed in-depth in other history classes - the history of narcotics, trade unions, and the incel movement for instance. The course was also structured such that you could largely work at your own pace and dive into topics you're actually interested in for the blog posts. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not really sure what I learned in this course.  Every lecture was a different topic, and it was difficult to tell how they all fit together. In general, this class was very anti-west, so much so that I felt the professors lacked credibility by the end of the course because of their bias. In fact, I found the professors to be pseudo-intellectual moralizers. The typical lecture went as follows: begin with some story about a random person, spend 20+ minutes talking about irrelevant details in their life, finally move into actual material, and spend the last 5 minutes cramming in all of the actual points that need to be made. I am very disappointed in the presentation of this course, and I strongly recommend it is reorganized for future offerings. ",

",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Lectures were phenomenal, sections were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses - Readings sometimes were a little disjointed and could be a lot at times ",

            "\u00a0It was incredibly disorganized and all over the place. I was often lost in lecture and then sections would cover entirely different material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: My section was great. Didn't know anyone beforehand, but because of the emphasis (40% of grade!!) plus a pretty solid TA, the sections actually turned into interesting discussions. Lectures were basically an entirely separate class from the readings+sections (which are all that really matter for grading purposes) but they're usually very interesting, honestly enjoyable to go to. You won't kill yourself if you have to miss a class but you usually want to go because you hear about some part of history you probably aren't very familiar with.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If your section/TA is bad, this class would be hell. Section is 40% of the grade and if the TA can't steer a discussion then the entire section suffers. A section asshole could totally cause a miserable semester. Lectures tend to feel disjointed -- good in that it allows for a ton of topic coverage, but bad if you're expecting a traditional \"X then Y then Z\" history class. ",

Use of multimedia in lectures and syllabus was another strength.\r\nWeaknesses - Co-teaching always comes with issues of consistency, but the nature of this course may have also added to that with a sense of discontinuity at times, jumping around from place to place and decade to decade between lectures and lecturers.

I liked how it was a survey course, so you got exposure to a bunch of different historical accounts in various countries\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures were not as engaging as others, and the readings (if you did them) were long ",

            "\u00a0The 4 blog posts are open-ended and left me not understanding what the teaching assistants or professors wanted from them... in the end it was apparent that \"blog\" posts meant mini-history essays in terms of structure and style. Even though the 4 posts were a great way of structuring the written content of this course, allowing students to write on a wide vary of material from the course, there should be substantially more written instructions for the blog posts. But also amazing that the professors allow for blog posts to be revised up until last hand in date in May - if a student wants a higher grade, they can most probably get it if they put the time and effort in. ",

            "\u00a0A strength is that it enriches a student's common knowledge about world history; however, a weakness would  e the fact that we covered too many topics and thus, did not deeply understand many of them or didn't have enough time to spend on a single one. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture could be more engaging, but loved sections! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - how many topics are covered\r\nWeaknesses - there is no connection between 2 lectures - every lecture could stand on its own so it's kind of difficult to just pick up and drop off different topics, but that is the way this course is currently designed. Also makes it hard to find general themes throughout the course because it just feels like no material is building on other material ",
            "\u00a0The primary strengths are the professors and the sections.  The primary weakness was that many students took this class expecting it to be a gut and then weren't invested in the course at all which detracted from the experience for other students. ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting but a bit disorganized as it jumped in many directions without a timeline. ",
            "\u00a0Needs to be more organized. I wasnt sure on any given lecture what exactly it was I was supposed to be getting from that lecture ",
            "\u00a0I think the content and the tone of the class was great. Its incredibly accessible to anyone and is a great poly sci meets history class with great lectures. I would try to incorporate some of the lecture material in the sections / make it clearer why the lectures correspond with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we covered more recent topics ",
            "\u00a0World c.2000 was an incredible course and by far my favorite this semester. Lectures were detailed and nearly always engaging. I took the class because I loved African Encounters with Colonialism last term and wanted another experience with Prof. Magaziner, who is amazing. I was skeptical that Prof. Moyn would be able to match Prof. Magaziner's enthusiasm and wit, but he did. My TA, Carlos Hernandez, led reflective, careful discussions and solicited our feedback multiple times throughout the semester, which I really appreciated. He also provided great feedback on my blogs.\r\n\r\nI would say there are two weaknesses, the first of which is hardly a weakness. I noticed a lot of people did not go to lecture. I was always there, so I saw how quickly the crowd began to thin, lecture after lecture, as more people realized they could write their blogs without referencing more than one or two lectures. I was disappointedclearly these people valued their grades over learning. Perhaps the blogs could somehow require that a certain number of lectures be cited, to force people to show up. Or attendance could be taken. I see this as much more a weakness of the Yale student body than the class, though. Second, the readings sometimes did not connect well to lecture. I struggled with those readings because I didn't have much context for them. Luckily, my TA Carlos did a good job explaining concepts in section. In addition, some weeks we had an entire book to read for section, while others we only had a few articles. I understand I had the syllabus ahead of time and could have planned better for these reading-heavy weeks, but even if I had, I think I would have still appreciated a more balanced reading load. These \"weaknesses\" did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the class. I hope, for the sake of other students interested in this period of history, it's taught again. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Magaziner was very engaging, and I thought the tweets were very fun!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course was extremely unorganized, and I felt that there was much disparity between the TFs grading of the blog posts. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a very manageable workload and some interesting lectures.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is one of the most biased courses I have ever taken. The professors have to constantly remind their audience that they are \"patriotism\" because otherwise their anti-American sentiments and outright communism would lead us to believe otherwise. It's quite sad, to be honest. ",

            "\u00a0great course overall ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this class is the topic it intends to cover: contemporary history. The rest, Im afraid, are all weaknesses. This is a class of slogans and anecdotes, with no rigorous approach to history which is too often used as an ideological instrument to support the professors worldviews. I went to lecture mostly out of self-consciousness and because one could discover a good thing or two but not much more. Other than that, not much could be gained from them. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course and how far reaching many of its lecture topics were. I do believe however that part of people's lack of engagement when I asked my fellow students was due to how far reaching the class seemed to be. A lot of students could not very concisely explain the class or its focus which I think sometimes hurt enthusiasm. ",

            "\u00a0This class was very well taught and the material was very engaging. I also liked the somewhat informal style of the blog posts because they encouraged more personal and thoughtful reflection that wasn't solely historical.

            "\u00a0100%, the lectures were fascinating. Learnt about aspects of history I had no clue about before this course and changed how I view the world around me today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone who does not have much knowledge in the historical context of issues we are facing today, and does not want to focus on one single topic, but rather explore themes on a larger scale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0This was a very easy course so for someone looking for a gut Id recommend it ",
            "\u00a0If interested in the readings! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you need a humanities credit and aren't much of a writer because the writing part of the course is only four 1000-word blogs, but other than that, I probably wouldn't go out of your way to take it because the discontinuity of the lectures was annoying for me at least. However, the material covered is good and can be interesting, stuff you wouldn't learn about in any other course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone.  It gives one a broad understanding of recent world history without assuming any prior knowledge.  It's a great course for anyone who's curious about the state of world affairs and how we got here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fulfills humanities credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It is so interesting and well-taught and I learned so much  Take this!! ",
            "\u00a0Maybe but only for my TA who was great and for a few of the lectures. Loved the discussion of media and connection to today ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Full stop. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you're willing to be fully invested. It offers really interesting perspectives on recent history. It was also fun to tweet each week. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - fantastic course. I learned a lot and became a better scholar. ",
            "\u00a0No. The low workload made this course seem manageable, but its extreme un organization made it extremely difficult to understand what was happening. From lecture to lecture I barely saw any connection, and even from slide to slide in a lectures PowerPoint I found myself confused. Not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Not particularly, though you can do well if you work on the blog posts. The lectures and most readings are nonessential to doing well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0As long as they enjoy modern history ",
            "\u00a0Yes very important in understanding current events ",
            "\u00a0yes because you learn a lot about world history which is always good ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to any student who hopes to make of their time at Yale one of rigorous intellectual challenge. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend the class to another student. Students loved the blog format that allowed us greater creative freedom when writing and also appreciated the huge amount of new information we came across. ",
            "\u00a0So, I was pretty confused by this course. I initially decided to take it because the syllabus looked amazing and I was super excited to learn more about contemporary history. The lectures, however, were SO disorganized. I appreciated the lecture outlines provided, but there seemed to be no larger themes that tied the lectures together (which was exacerbated by the fact that there were two different lecturers for the class) and my classmates and I were often confused about the overarching narrative we were supposed to derive from each lecture. Also, we were supposed to learn about contemporary history, but there wasn't a single lecture that dealt with it at all. I really would have appreciated some kind of explanatory lecture about what contemporary history meant, why it's important/elusive/useful, and how to approach writing about contemporary events through a historical lens before we were asked to do so for a grade. This leads me to the last point: the blogs. Please, if this is to be taught again, please have a rubric ready for the blogs. At first, I really liked writing the blogs because they allowed me to be creative and pick a specific topic from the course to dive into. However, as time went on, and we got our grades back, there was just such a disparity in the kind of blogs people were writing and the kinds of comments we were receiving that none of us were really sure what we were supposed to be doing. I would really recommend specifying that we use a certain number of readings or lectures and having some examples on canvas for this class, just because it was really difficult to know if we were doing enough. I really don't mean to be overly harsh, but this was just my experience with the course. I liked the lectures and thought they were interesting, and the blogs were definitely a reprieve from the more structured/basic academic assignments we're always asked to write, but I definitely think this course could be improved upon through a little more organization. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Very relevant info- although there is a lot of jumping around from country to country within a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were well-versed in the events circa year 2000. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in history and current events and want to learn about decolonization in a relatively low-stress and engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would because I think it provides a very helpful base of historical knowledge that helps contextualize the  world we live in today. "
