            "\u00a0I learned how to really pay attention to structure and organization of the Semitic language, and how those skills helps with translating in all languages. This taught me how to think about language, and that was super cool. ",
            "\u00a0One of the more important things we looked at was how the YBC stores and catalogues their materials. This was important and fascinating because their materials in their collection is incredibly important for an entire field of study and they have a responsibility to  a lot of people internationally.

            "\u00a0Reading texts was very interesting. It could be improved by teaching more topics from comparative semitics so we had better understandings of the principles behind the language. ",
            "\u00a0Good balance between covering grammar in the first semester, and abundant practice opportunities in class during the second semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think the pedagogy could be a bit clearer, and that we spent more time in detail on some of the grammatical pieces. I loved that the grades were based on take home exams so that we could really engage our skills and use more time to truly understand the language than just learn it to test it. The chances we were given to interact with direct material and texts pushed me to not only learn the language but learn the skills that would help me re-learn it in the future for application if I forget pieces.
