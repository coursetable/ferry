The teaching assistants are also amazing and are there to help you with everything! Outside of class, Pak Indriyo and the assistants have gone to students' events/performances/games and had picnics/events to learn more about Indonesia. The language itself is not difficult to learn and the workload is low. Pak Indriyo makes this class fun and interactive! Best language to take at Yale! ",
