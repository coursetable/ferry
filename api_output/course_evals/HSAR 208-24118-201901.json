            "\u00a0I learned how to look at art from a culture I was unfamiliar with. I also learned how to more effectively critique and think about the ways in which museums/art institutions handle and display art from non-western cultures. ",
            "\u00a0As a survey course, this class offered students a sense of the breadth of crafts, materials, religions, cultures and their hybrids, traditions, and innovations which inform art on the African continent and among its diaspora. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview on the different art produced within cultures and countries within African primarily focusing on the east coast. We also learned about the wide diaspora of African art, and our last topic focused on contemporary African Art. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the concepts in this class were hard to understand and contextualize through a European lens so I think a lot of the concepts were well explained with the readings and in-depth discussions. The teacher also tried a lot of interactive activities like a fake trial about the repatriation of African objects, the material aspects of the objects, and even a dance workshop. ",
            "\u00a0This course started from the beginning and addressed visual analysis before moving on to making arguments about art. It was also an important opportunity to learn about African arts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was definitely a survey, prioritizing breadth over depth. By consequence, I learned a little bit about many Western, and a few Eastern, African expressive cultures. I really appreciated that the course assumed no prior knowledge with African Art, and enjoyed the course discussions on long-standing issues such as museum display and repatriation. ",
            "\u00a0As an art history major I've taken many HSAR courses at Yale, however, the large majority offered tend to focus on a cis straight white male Eurocentric canon of art history. This class, African Arts and Expressive Cultures, was a great introductory course at opening me up to the various arts across the African continent and the African diaspora. I learned not only about the visual material but also about the historical context regarding each work of art. This course also encouraged students to think about how African art is collected in museums and to engage with the collection at the Yale University Art Gallery. "

        [
            "\u00a0It covered too large a time period and two large a geography. Most people in the class were unfamiliar with African cultures outside the context of colonialism/the slave trade. Therefore, it was pretty confusing/overwhelming to have to learn so much in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of this course was its critical eye towards the ways in which art historians and museum curators have previously qualified African art. The breadth of the course is a double edged swordit often felt as though we had to take entire regions and cultures for granted in order to understand a given art object, without really having the time to understand the cultural forces which produced a given context. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: broad overview that allowed me to learn a lot about the different types of art produced.\r\nWeakness: A LOT of memorisation, including the height of the objects. The final exam required us to learn over 200 artworks. I think it would have been better to have a narrower focus on the exam, so we can delve deeper into each topic. ",
            "\u00a0The idea of studying the art of an entire continent from the beginning of time to the present is hard to visualize and would be a very daunting process. I thought the concepts we studied to be very interesting and could be applied to many aspects of African art so I thought the choices were very intentional and smart. The content of the exams were very unreasonable. The number of objects and information for each one was very disorganized and too much to ask at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized, and every lecture was very clear. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Fromont could have done much more with the course. Her presentations style was sub-par and it was often difficult to follow what she was saying. It was a class of only 15 students and she often confused me with others which was disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it's truly introductory, assuming no prior knowledge of not only African Art, but of art history generally--it felt like a 100-level class. It could be improved by reformatting the final exam to focus less on memorization (we had to learn the names/dates/measurements/etc. of 200+ objects). Trying to cram a bunch of numbers in my head was extremely stressful without being intellectually rigorous; it effectively prevented me from learning about the significance of the objects and the course's overarching themes. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches students to learn about African arts in a holistic introductory manner. I learned not only how to visually analyse the works of art, but also about the relevant historical context, and the contemporary discussions surrounding African art. \r\n\r\nHowever, a few changes should be made in order to better facilitate student's learning in this course. Firstly, Professor Fromont's lectures were not as well organized as they could have been. In many other art history courses, professors hand out a list of objects with relevant tombstone information at the beginning of each class period so that students know what objects (and terms / concepts) to focus on. While Professor Fromont's lectures each focused on a specific topic, I often felt confused about what objects were the main interest and which would be included on the exam.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Professor Fromont's exams were frustrating and ultimately not productive for my learning. Both the midterm exam and the final exam were cumulative, which meant that students had to memorize all the tombstone information (creator/artist/culture, medium, title, height) for hundreds of objects for each exam when in reality each exam only tested our knowledge of a dozen objects at most. This was frustrating, because instead of spending time thinking about the larger themes for the course, I was forced to waste time memorizing the information for more than one hundred objects that I would never be tested on. Other art history professors opt to provide a list of approximately 20 objects to their students so that students know which areas to concentrate on. (For example, Professor Pamela Lee did this for her course HSAR 347 this semester. Many of the students in HSAR 347 also took HSAR 208 and expressed that they much preferred Professor Lee's approach than Professor Fromont.) \r\n\r\nHowever, the weekly reading responses were useful because they prompted students to actually complete the readings which led to productive sections and discussions.

            "\u00a0I think the study of African art provided a unique opportunity to think critically about museums and art institutions including the YUAG which is really valuable to anyone interested in history or art history. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an art history major, it is a good course to take and will most likely fulfil a distribution requirement. I did really like this course and learned a lot. I do think that the amount we were required to memorise, however, was too much. I think that narrowing down the images we are expected to know for the exam would allows us to learn more about each object. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more classes offered about African arts that were more specific and nuanced but I thought it was extremely interesting and something more people should be exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered a very important opportunity to learn about African arts. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were either (a) really good at/not bothered by intense memorization, or (b) taking the class credit-d-fail. The final is just so overwhelming and stressful that it interferes with studying for other exams. If it were changed for the next iteration of the course, however, I would wholeheartedly recommend the class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are looking to expand their understanding of art history. However, I would caution that if the above changes are not made, the student will need to be able to complete weekly reading responses and study for a cumulative final. "
