Examples of this are NMR, Diels-Alder, PLP, peptide formation, sugars, ether synthesis, carbonyl chemistry, aromaticity, amines, drugs, etc. I learned how to apply my baseline understanding of reactions to new problems, and how slightly altering conditions (like acid vs. base or adding peroxides) will result in a different product.

            "\u00a0The extra credit on exams given out in class was one of the most frustrating and irritating things I have seen done while here at Yale.  It was arbitrary, done excessively, a poor use of class time, and catered exclusively to a specific style of student, while overlooking all those who were less aggressively outspoken in the class.\r\nIn a class graded on a curve, where despite the general positive atmosphere and camaraderie, competition between students does directly play a role in personal results, creating non-equal opportunity chances for extra credit is actively unfair. If extra credit is to be given out, it should be for exceptional achievement by individuals, and it should not be dependent on being located in the  best line of sight for your teacher. While having extra credit available for students is a friendly gesture to the class, it is clear that there was not thought put in to ensuring that it would be distributed through a fair mechanism, such as inclusion as a bonus problem on exams, rather than arbitrary selection by the  professor from the class. \r\nPerhaps even the unfairness could be overlooked if the distribution of these bonus points were not done in a way that was  a noticeably unproductive use of class time. In a class that was already very heavily example driven, taking additional time to have students go up to the board and slowly draw out a mechanism that often required some additional correction (though rarely at the cost of any bonus points) hardly seemed like a helpful use of class time. Having students going to the board is a valuable piece of active learning that often makes sense in a 13 person section where all students can be drawn in to participate, but is not at all practical in a 200+ person lecture. While I applaud the effort to implement active learning principles, I think there are many other ways in which this could be done that would be more practical and time-efficient (eg. clickers). \r\nAs critical as this has been, I would like to reiterate that  I do appreciate the effort that was  made by the  professor.  Clearly this was meant with good intent as a  harmless way to increase class participation and engage with the students, and the spirit behind it was good. In practice however it was an infuriating practice that reduced fairness, class productivity, and created general frustration, and I would strongly press for its discontinuation or at least major restructuring in future years.

            "\u00a0This class is very subtly very bad. Crawford sounds like he's doing a fine job explaining concepts, and if you listen to every 10 minute chunk of his lectures in isolation he does a fine job. The class, and his lectures, suffer from a complete lack of coherent organization. He'll often skip around, come back to previously covered material, give you the name the reaction or class of reactions after having explained the whole mechanism, etc. It's easy to not realize this until studying for the exams. The exams themselves are pretty reasonable given what the material is, it is just needlessly difficult to learn. The material is essentially straight memorization which makes it uninteresting, and Crawford doesn't do much to salvage that. He attempts to incorporate bio stuff into the last few lectures, except often doesn't actually explain what the connection to the previously covered material which makes it difficult to contextualize and makes the only potentially interesting part of the class mostly just frustrating. The exams are the only forms of feedback other than PSETs written by the TAs, who apparently aren't told what topics are going to be tested on because the PSETs don't correlate even remotely to the exam questions. The book problems are also at best tangentially related, and despite his description of his own personal selection of book problems to be used for practice as \"emphasis problems\" they emphasize concepts that he either never covers in lecture, aren't going to be tested on, or both. ",
            "\u00a0This lectures for this class were disorganized and it was unclear what was expected of us to know until about a week before an exam. Oftentimes, the professor would digress into different reactions and topics that we did not quite understand, and it was still unclear whether we were expected to know these things or not. The notes on the chalkboard were extremely messy and did not seem to follow any coherent flow of information. The notes posted on Canvas (which are ostensibly better versions of the information given in class) were also minimally helpful, as they did not follow any sectioning of content and the mechanisms did not follow any coherent flow.

            "\u00a0I thought the course had a fairly good overview of organic chemistry and the tests were very fair. I'm not if I truly understood the background behind all the mechanisms and it often felt like I was simply memorizing material. The materials uploaded on Canvas were super helpful, especially the extra practice questions. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating material, but disorganized. Crawford is obviously very intelligent and passionate, but the lack of structure for his notes really threw off my studying this whole semester. Sometimes he would go to another topic with saying anything, or writing a new heading, and it would be confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Prof. Crawford did a good job of keeping the class engaged during lecture by having students solve problems on the board and encouraging group work, but I think he could've done a better job of making sure that everyone was following. If the one volunteer who went up to the board got the problem right, he assumed that everyone understood and plowed ahead, which was frustrating at times. On that note, the class could've made some of the connections between the topics clearer--they were very difficult to learn in lecture because they were all presented as somewhat discrete, but when I went back and studied them myself, it became a lot easier because there were only a few guiding principles that applied a lot of the time. Section was also a huge strength--it was hugely important for me to go and just go through the topics we had learned in the past week more slowly and in a smaller group setting. ",
            "\u00a0Students would likely benefit from quizzes. Its a good way of ensuring that students keep up with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the ties to life processes were interesting during this course but didn't really appear until the last few weeks. Additionally, the last few weeks felt quite rushed, and it seemed that we were speeding through a lot of reactions. I also felt that the content during lecture could sometimes be disorganized, which could be confusing in lecture but also in going back and trying to understand what was covered and what we need to know. Lastly, I felt that the grading scheme was perhaps a little harsh, as the final counted for 50% of the grade. This made it seem like an entire semester's worth of work could be overshot by one bad test. ",
            "\u00a0There was no mandatory homework or quizzes so it was hard to gauge how you would do on exams. Exams also make up a large percent of your grade so it was hard to have a buffer for your grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very poorly taught and incredibly unorganized. The entire course grade is determined by three exams, with the final worth 50% of the entire course grade. Pedagogically, this encourages cramming and is detrimental to overall educational goals of retaining material.  I do not feel that I gained any worthwhile organic chemistry intuition or knowledge beyond being able to regurgitate mechanisms and information for exams and subsequently forget the material. Professor Crawford is often condescending, made a number of uncalled for analogies throughout the semester (the most offensive of which was comparing pregnancy to cancer), and puts a biochemical twist on the curriculum that deviates from the core of organic chemistry II, introducing mechanisms that even the TAs were unfamiliar with. This course would be improved under different supervision and by teaching a curriculum which either better aligns with the available text or by providing more thorough, clear and organized course notes and supplemental practice materials. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Crawford really tries to minimize rote memorization and emphasizes basic concepts. He is very skilled at providing many examples that can help us really understand the basic concepts and how to apply them, rather than just memorizing reactions. However, I believe that the grading breakdown is not conducive to this approach. The fact that 100 percent of the grade comes from exams is a little anxiety-inducing, and it naturally leads to students cramming moments before exams. (I know that the ideal student would review concepts on a regular basis, but most of us are not like that.) To mitigate this, I think a lot of people can benefit if CHEM 221 were to institute the four 10-minute in-class quizzes, just like CHEM 220. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat disorganized, and the grade is concentrated solely in exams, but it was very study-able. Workload was about the same as other Yale courses because there were no psets but studying for 3 midterms and the final was super time consuming ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course content. The content was a lot more relevant for biology and medicine and so I felt more engaged with the content than I did in orgo 1.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of resources. Unlike the first semester, you don't get as many practice tests and you don't get the quizzes to prepare for exams. This puts all of the weight on the 2 midterms you keep and the final, which was a whopping 50% of your whole grade. ",
            "\u00a0weakness: boring lecture course, could be helped by some more engaging learning methods, rather than three exams.\r\nstrengths: well organized, well explained ",

            "\u00a0The course lacked a clear sense of organization and a unifying direction for the reactions that we were learning. I wish one subject could flow logically into the next so that it was easier to understand within the context of what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that exam topics were fair to what we learned. It can improved with clearer assignments of the text and homework problems (there were sometimes disconnect between what was assigned and what was covered in class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: expectations for exam material was very clear. Lectures were well taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes not enough supporting material for exam topics. So required a bit of outside research. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: \r\n1. Lack of lecture structure and organization (objectives at the beginning of class would be helpful, as would section headings each time a new topic was approached) \r\n2. Unclear class notes posted on Canvas\r\n3. Inaccessibility of office hours (due to timing and location)\r\n4. Extra problems were not clearly assigned, making it difficult to know what to practice\r\n5. Failure to integrate information across chapters clearly (e.g. how is this lecture related to the last lecture or the one 5 weeks ago)\r\n6. More practice midterms/finals were needed\r\n7. Lack of ability to gauge the class. I really appreciated that professor Crawford asked the class a lot of questions to gauge our understanding HOWEVER he was unable to properly utilize this information. For example, Professor Crawford would often ask a question and get a wide arrange of responses, few of which were the correct answer. He would then pick out the two people who said the correct answer, and say \"I heard the correct answer, you guys clearly understand\" instead of reviewing that topic, which was clearly needed. \r\n8. HORRENDOUS PARTICIPATION INCENTIVE! Professor Crawford asks students to come to the board to demonstrate their knowledge, often rewarding them +2 bonus points. In theory this sounds great, but it is necessarily exclusive. Only students who feel like they have the least to lose were willing to go up. As a result, the majority of the students who went to the board were cis-gendered, white males. Of course there were exceptions, but it was evident that women and people of color were not going up to the board. Power-dynamics had a lot to do with this, but I doubt Professor Crawford ever noticed this, as he never did anything to address it or find ways to get OTHER students to participate. I understand that participation is a crucial part of creating a rewarding lecture experience for both the professor and their students, but it must be INCLUSIVE. Moreover, the bonus points were not helpful. They mainly helped those who needed the least amount of help.\r\n9.  Professor was condescending. Several times I asked a question and the response was \"You don't know this?\" I was shocked, especially because several other students had the same question as me. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the material covered in this class, but I think the class's structure could be improved. The lack of any psets or graded assignments make it very hard to stay accountable and keep up with the material. Even if assignments were worth a very small percentage of the grade, it would be helpful to stay on top of work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the topics covered are very interesting. it was a lot of fun to learn the material for this class, and I felt like I learned a lot about organic chemistry mechanisms and general chemistry knowledge. The weakness is that it was a little disorganized. Crawford is not the most organized professor, and his notes are very confusing. The tests were not written super clearly, which was another issue. The review sessions for the second and third midterm held by the TAs was not helpful at all and also was disorganized. These should/could be improved. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: professor provides list of exam topics and the midterms are pretty fair based on these topics \r\nWeaknesses: professors notes arent as organized as Ellmans so piecing together the info is a struggle but if you manage to figure it out its not too hard ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it is well-paced and covers important reactions (e.g. ones that we would need to know for the MCAT). Another strength is that the TA's are all very knowledgeable and good at re-covering material that was confusing in lecture. A weakness of the course is that Prof. Crawford sometimes goes over things very quickly in class, and we don't have a chance to ask questions. Additionally, he holds office hours when most students can't attend, so it's difficult to get personalized help from him. The course could be improved by giving students a chance to answer questions in class, and also by Prof. Crawford holding more office hours. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that Professor Crawford would help us hone study topics prior to exams. One weakness is that it was often unclear which parts of the textbook we should read / understand. ",

In addition, Dr. Crawford often presented reactions in lecture without fully explaining what they were or how they related to the material we were studying (usually biochemical reactions that occur in nature), and they were often not in the book and thus hard to study. In general, lectures were structured in a way that did not facilitate learning - the best way learn the material was usually reading the textbook.\r\n\r\nSuggestion for improvement: change the extra credit policy to one which offers equal opportunity to all students.

He'll often skip around, come back to previously covered material, give you the name the reaction or class of reactions after having explained the whole mechanism, etc. It's easy to not realize this until studying for the exams. The exams themselves are pretty reasonable given what the material is, it is just needlessly difficult to learn. The material is essentially straight memorization which makes it uninteresting, and Crawford doesn't do much to salvage that. He attempts to incorporate bio stuff into the last few lectures, except often doesn't actually explain what the connection to the previously covered material which makes it difficult to contextualize and makes the only potentially interesting part of the class mostly just frustrating. The exams are the only forms of feedback other than PSETs written by the TAs, who apparently aren't told what topics are going to be tested on because the PSETs don't correlate even remotely to the exam questions. The book problems are also at best tangentially related, and despite his description of his own personal selection of book problems to be used for practice as \"emphasis problems\" they emphasize concepts that he either never covers in lecture, aren't going to be tested on, or both.
