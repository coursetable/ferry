            "\u00a0This course strengthened my knowledge of medieval art, hagiography, and other textual traditions. The seminar structure of the course encouraged me to participate and engage with other classmates in interdisciplinary material. Students were required to lead class discussions on particular readings every week, which helped me to learn how to  think critically about the way in which the material was presented, summarize the material for the class, and come up with questions or comments that would sustain class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a good oversight of the visionary culture of the late Middle Ages in Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an array of medieval visionary experiences, as well as the methods for approaching these visions in historical and art historical disciplines. I gained additional insight into the relationship between visionary experience, art/architecture, religious practices, and memory. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my knowledge of the practices of visionaries in the Middle Ages, doing a lot of reading that will help me understand better their place within the landscape of medieval devotion and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Great exposure to medieval art and surrounding academic literature. Also a solid opportunity to learn about visionary experience, with useful and eye-opening digressions into non-medieval visionary cultures. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was very well structured and the seminar topics for each week were well planned. I appreciated that students were held responsible for the content in the readings each week, which helped to foster interesting and engaging conversations. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more close looking at medieval objects/art in class to strengthen our analyses of the texts we had read for homework although this would be a minor improvement for an otherwise excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that seminars were broken up with a visit to Beinecke and a visit to the Met, although I think we would have benefitted from doing readings in preparations for both visits to get more out of it. The course could have been improved if there had been more of a focus on scholarship about visionaries and vision more broadly speaking. ",
            "\u00a0It was a terrific course! ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it felt like the readings were a little repetitive. Often I felt disorganized coming into class with regards to our assignments. Strengths of the course was that the readings were really interesting, Prof. Jung really was invested in us as students, and people seemed engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The interdisciplinary aspects of the syllabus were definitely a strength! I also appreciated the field trips. Overall, I feel like I learned a great deal.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily a fault of the course, but I had some trouble connecting the dots chronologically and culturally. We were exposed to a lot of material, while also directing our focus particularly to a few visionary writers (in terms of primary sources). A little more hand-holding would've helped me to understand the greater historical and ecclesiastical narratives that shaped the visionary personalities and texts we read. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they were interested in pursuing work in medieval art history or medieval studies. It was appropriately interdisciplinary and many of the readings assigned are canon in the world of medieval art history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's fascinating material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Jung is an engaging seminar leader, and the course content is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it as a general course on an important facet of medieval culture and art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is a great opportunity to approach a topic in an interdisciplinary fashion. You will come away from the course with a deepened knowledge of art historical approaches to medieval cultural production, but will learn many other things along the way. I never expected to spend time examining Latin American ayahuasca-fueled visionary painting in class, but we did that and much more, all the while gaining insight into the multifaceted human phenomenon that is mystical experience. The inquisitive will be rewarded by this course!\r\n\r\nAs a side-note: I was initially intimidated by this class because of the course description. I think it was the listing of \"highly recommended\" languages that made me think I would be wildly unqualified. But the materials were actually very approachable, by and large, and none of the languages listed ended up being necessary. So, interested students needn't fret! And maybe that bit should be removed from the course description... "
