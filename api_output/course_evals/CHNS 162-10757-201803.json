            "\u00a0I significantly increased my Chinese vocabulary, and developed my ability to write 800-character-plus-long essays in a different language. I'm also coming out of this semester with a huge arsenal of  (four-character idioms), a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and some bits of philosophy, and a newly developed relationship with a great (and friendly) teacher.

            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course was learning about history and culture along with the Chinese, while the weakness was that some of the things it focused on, such as hand-writing Chinese and traditional Chinese, were not that useful. ",
            "\u00a0Great class with clear feedback ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Su Wei is amazing. It's clear that he cares deeply about each and every one of his students, and it's a pleasure to talk to him (and attend his calligraphy sessions on Friday!). I was also constantly amazed by the number of stories about his life that he had ready to tell at any time, on command. In this class, I developed my vocabulary and picked up a lot of formal sentence structures that will come in useful in the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Su Wei didn't have us talk much in class (except to recite pre-typed sentences or read aloud directly from the textbook), so I didn't develop my speaking ability as well as I had in previous Chinese courses at Yale. Also, I would've appreciated more in-depth feedback on essays, which he had initially done in the beginning of the semester but eased up on as time went by. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over some of the lower level Chinese classes since it focuses more on learning about culture/history and less about memorizing vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is great ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to another student if not for the material, then for Su Wei. I enjoyed this class incredibly, and it was a nice breather from the rigors of the rest of my class schedule. Through Su Wei's stories and ramblings, you'll learn a lot about Chinese culture, history, and society, and discover just how beautiful the Chinese language. That last bit's probably what's most important  I ended up loving Chinese more than I had coming in, and though I was a little disappointed about the lack of progress in my speaking ability, the pros definitely outweighed the cons for me.
