            "\u00a0You learn lots and lots about acting in general, not just acting for Chekhovian theater! ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of acting principles in regard to Stanislavsky and Chekhov, with some lovely Uta Hagen thrown into the mix. As for insights, not only did I gain insight on Chekhovian acting, and even Chekhov's contemporary Russia, but almost every class I left feeling like I had learned something new about myself, I truly felt like a different person after every class, and that is what an acting class should offer the student, a chance to grow and change and still be yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Chekhov and Stanislavsky technique when approaching scenes specifically written by Chekhov. I learned about the history of Russian theater as well as the general history of Russia at the turn of the 20th century. "

            "\u00a0You get to know people in your class really well which is such a heartwarming experience. There is clear feedback that you receive from Greg, and that's super helpful for students to develop and better their acting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material and Professor\r\nWeakness: Does it have to meet at 8:30am-12:30pm on a Tuesday? It conflicts with so many other courses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class does not demand a lot of you, and you get to watch the development of some incredible actors. The final project is SO cool, and such an intimate and great way to cap off the class. Professor Wallace is so fun and he makes everyone in the room feel important!\r\nWeaknesses: the class is so early, and you really have to focus for 4 hours (even though you're only acting for about 1 of those 4 hours, on a good day). Also you only get to do 2 scenes and 1 monologue in the class, so the scope isn't that large. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in the four major plays of Chekhov, or if this is your first foray into Acting, professor Wallace welcomes you. It is a wonderful class ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who wants to pursue acting but who does not have much formal acting training. "
