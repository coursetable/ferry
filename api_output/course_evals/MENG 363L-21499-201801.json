            "\u00a0I certainly learned some of the difficulties of dimensional and uncertainty analysis like never before. Further, we were drilled on how to precisely and succinctly write a scientific report. ",
            "\u00a0This lab does a good job at teaching you thermo and fluids, better than the classes themselves. But at what cost ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about thermo and fluids. Really helped ground the concepts from the two classes. ",

            "\u00a0A more vivid understanding of the underlying principles and experimental observations of fluid dynamics, as well as thermodynamics. Reynolds number and other dimensionless variables now become a natural part of my thinking. ",
            "\u00a0While the class isn't a crash-course on technical writing (I only learned a bit about how to streamline my lab reports, write clearly while comprehensively), it is definitely a crash-course on the real-life practice of engineering. The class taught me when it's appropriate to simplify/estimate- and to distinguish between when diving into research publications/advanced topics is superfluous or necessary to explain results. The class is a lot of self-teaching, but you do improve on your data analysis skills. As Prof. Gomez says, rather than throwing an an explanation to \"see what sticks\", you learn how to use the discussion section of your reports to your advantage in new ways- to tell a compelling narrative with your data. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the experimental methods behind fundamental fluid mechanics and thermodynamics topics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely nothing I didn't already know, my skills in fluids and thermo were not at all improved and neither was my writing ability "

            "\u00a0This class. Man oh man. While I do think I walked away having learned a *few* things, this course is basically a \"oh you took Fluids last semester and Thermodynamics the semester before? Well lets see how well you actually remember those concepts you baboon\" sort of class. For one, it would have been EXTREMELY helpful to have ANY SORT of open office hours, whether that be with Gomez himself or ANY of the TAs literally ANY TIME god I can't count the number of times I felt lost and helpless on a report this semester and I either had to schedule an appointment or figure it all out myself. ",
            "\u00a0This class required more time than entire previous semesters I've taken at Yale. I would say the work load of this class alone is equal to 3-4 regular Yale classes. I definitely lost track of the hours I put into this class on a weekly basis. That begin said, I probably learned more than I ever have before in a Yale class so it was certainly a trade-off. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so much work. It definitely deserves at least another half credit or for the writing portion to be moved to a less intense lab (materials science?) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely needs some work in terms of workload and focus of the class. A big issue is feedback. It's difficult to know how you're doing in the class throughout due to few comments and fewer grades. A lot of concepts made sense though, and they previously hadn't. ",
            "\u00a0Thid course is incredibly. Complex and is not for the faint of heart. There's very little safety net and you HAVE to keep up or get lost. ",
            "\u00a0Way too much workload, also often very little guidance from the TA's. This course should be multiple credits!! ",
            "\u00a0Wow so horrible. 2x the work of all my other classes and terrible feedback so we could newer improve. ",
            "\u00a0Not clear grading, feedback, or expectations. Good lectures ",
            "\u00a0Strength: you learn a TON about fluids and thermo and lab writing \r\nWeakness: huge stressor and took a huge toll on metal health and confidence as an engineer. Put so much time into labs only to make me feel really dumb and terrible about myself. Moral declines lab after lab.... ",
            "\u00a0Strength: interesting experiments helped visualize phenomena and deepened our understanding of concepts from the text\r\nWeakness: little to no useful feedback, and even these come super late (delayed by say, a month or more). No grade was given until the last few days of this semester, so we had no sense of how well/ badly we did for the entire term. We also had trouble comprehending Professor Gomez's handwritten comments, and even when we did, our interpretation was subjective by nature. We had no idea about the extent to which each mistake contributed to the grade of each report. These added up to 20+ hrs of frustration each week, with no way of gauging whether or not we improved. ",
            "\u00a0I will say though that this course will consume your academic life for the semester (~25+ hours of work per week). ",
            "\u00a0The professor and disorganization of this course are strong weaknesses and totally destroyed the learning experience. This course needs to be taught by a better professor (two professors preferably) and needs to have the workload cut down to avoid students getting physically ill and mentally exhausted from it. ",
            "\u00a0Every thermo lab we did was a colossal waste of time. Calorimetry is lame, watching someone turn on a turbine or an IC engine is lame, watching someone run on a tread mill is lame. I didn't learn anything from those, and you might say well you must have learned from doing the lab reports. Except that the lab reports didn't get back to us for several weeks so I would just forget about it for awhile and then find out I did it wrong. The short report format was cool except that it meant I didn't actually get to work on my writing abilities. It's a writing credit. I'm willing to do the writing to get it. And the lab manual would give super vague instructions and tell us to just figure it out, which I proved I couldn't do, so I really felt like I was just left out to dry in this class. And then I would hear back on every report that my analysis wasn't deep enough. Okay, but there are no instructions so I don't know what is expected. There was one time I put in supplemental materials that were literally copied and pasted from a textbook that I found on the MIT website, and Gomez marked it all to hell with his occasionally legible red pen. So I didn't end up learning anything, the fluids labs were nice visualizations of very easy concepts, so not really a worthwhile use of my time,  and the thermo labs were just stupid. No useful feedback, nothing useful in the lectures, possibly one of the worst classes I've taken here,  including matsci with Udo, and that's saying something. "

            "\u00a0Only take it if you're positive they've REVAMPED it like SG promised. Its required for ABET, so if you're not a MechE ABET and taking this course \"For Fun\" then I'm assuming you're a snake person from the planet nad la cka ewffc ",
            "\u00a0I would never recommend this course to another student. People who are doing ABET have to take it and people who are not doing ABET should spend their time more wisely. You will learn a lot if you take this class but it will come at the cost of your happiness and sanity. ",
            "\u00a0No. Great course, Gomez is awesome its just an absurd amount of work. Stay away for the love of god ",
            "\u00a0It needs some work, and it's being reworked. You learn a lot, just a ton of work for half a credit. Gomez is really tough, but a funny guy ",
            "\u00a0By far the hardest class Ive taken at Yale. Dont take it unless you have to. If youre abet good luck! ",
            "\u00a0No, absolutely not. Gomez tries his hardest to ruin your lives. It's at least three times the amount of work of normal engineering classes, and you never know how you're doing in the class until it was too late. Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to! It will be the hardest course you take at Yale and also probably the biggest waste of your time. ",
            "\u00a0Lol no don't take this unless you have to. ",
            "\u00a0This is the mech e killer class. Required for ABET, be mindful of your other classes the semester you take this. ",
            "\u00a0Takes up your entire semester and caused an average of a meltdown a week. Definitely learned a ton but at a huge mental and time cost. ",
            "\u00a0You are looking at this course because you want to go ABET in mechanical engineering. You are only taking this course because you have to, and it carries a writing credit: a permit for the instructor to torture you in addition to fluid and thermal concepts. You will almost never satisfy Gomez's taste for analysis, and you won't even know exactly how much you missed it by. Feedback came super late, to a degree that several reports have been turned in before you receive your annotated first report. And I said annotated, not graded. We did not receive a grade until the last week of the whole semester. It was the end of reading period when we saw, for the first time, how close we were from failing. Oh, if people above or below me haven't mentioned, expect >>20 hours of work EACH WEEK.\r\n\r\nOf course, rumor has it that the course will be changing its composition to make it less demanding. Maybe it'll change for the better? It doesn't affect us anyways. We don't give a f---. It already made a dent on our GPA. Did all this effort make us better engineers? Perhaps. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt the culminating course of my mechanical engineering studies. It basically synthesized everything you've learned conceptually and forced you to reconcile concepts with practical application. ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. This course took an average of 20 to 30 hours of work per\r\nweek and this doesnt include the labs (which on their own were very long) or the lectures.\r\nBoth data analysis for each report and then composing each report took so much time that this\r\ncourse should be worth 2 credits instead of 1. Lectures with Gomez were useless as his\r\nlecturing style made no sense  his teaching style was very unclear. He was all over the place\r\nand couldnt make a distinct point so we were left to teach ourselves much of the material that\r\nwas needed just to complete the data analysis for each lab. When it came time to write lab\r\nreports, the expectations were very unclear. For the first lab report, Gomez had offered to\r\nprovide us with a sample lab report but then at the last minute decided not to, leaving us to\r\nwrite our first lab report with zero guidance. Then, after our first lab report was submitted, he\r\nproceeded to berate us in lecture about how poor our reports were. On top of this, we were\r\ngiven almost no feedback for grades throughout the semester. By reading period, we had only\r\nreceived a grade for one lab report (out of 10) so it was nearly impossible to gauge how well\r\nyou were doing in the class. And when Gomez did leave feedback on a lab report, it was\r\ncompletely illegible. Overall, the worst thing about this course is Gomez. If Gomez is teaching\r\nthis class again, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He doesnt care about his students, complains about\r\nhaving to grade our work, his handwriting is illegible and his comments are unclear, he is rude\r\nand condescending, and he is a horrible teacher. It is honestly just embarrassing for the\r\nmechanical engineering department that this man has been allowed to teach this course like\r\nthis for so many years. It is clear that he can get away with anything and no one sticks up to him\r\n not even his superiors. Taking this course has made it clear that who every is in charge of the\r\nmechE department does not care at all about the well-being of their students and cares more\r\nabout giving in to Gomezs wishes. Bottom line is if you care about your physical and mental\r\nwell-being while at Yale, do not take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Corey is a huge pushover, you can probably  convince him to still let you be ABET without this one class. If it's taught by anyone else, maybe give it a shot "
