            "\u00a0I learned optical and materials chemistry techniques. Many of the synthesis techniques in materials were similar to other labs but we got to learn different analysis techniques such as SEM and x-ray crystallography. The optics portion was very hands on and taught me theory as well as practical procedures. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skills needed to perform multiple laboratory techniques by taking this course. For instance, I learned how to conduct solution-phase synthesis of quantum dots, how to conduct solid-phase synthesis of phosphors, how to observe single molecule fluorescence, and how to build an optical trap. I also learned how perform UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, SEM, and EDS, and how to interpret the results of each. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge:\r\n\tSynthesis, properties and characterization of frontline materials such as graphene\r\n\tUtilization of graphene as a surface for quantum dots and the chemistry of quantum dots\r\n\tFluorescence and transitions\r\n\tLanthanide series metals and uses\r\n\tA lot of fundamental optical physics, lenses, light rays, resolution, magnification\r\n\tOptics applied to quantum dots and microparticles\r\n\tOptical tweezers and biological applications of optics \r\n\r\nSkills and insights:\r\n\tSome new synthetic techniques in graphene and quantum dot synthesis such as sonication, centrifugation, crystallographic analysis through databases etc.\r\n\t(very frustrating but not proportionately rewarding): alignment and building of optical apparatuses and the extremely meticulous control of small components (+fine motor skills) required to make an experiment work\r\n\tHow simple it is to create very modern materials such as quantum dots and fluorescent materials\r\n\tHow optical techniques can be leveraged in during-experiment adjustments and post-experiment MATLAB code manipulations to deliver insights about the microscopic scale such as bacteria and micro particulates ",

            "\u00a0A very good course! Lectures and laboratory sessions were designed to maximize student learning; all criticisms and evaluations were intended to improve student work for the future. Very few improvements to be made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear lectures relevant to labs, interesting labs, great instructors, straightforward lab reports. A great deal is learned from each lab and lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0A very good course with fascinating new content, reasonable workload and lenient professors but deadly-exhausting labwork and pointless report-writing. Probably one of the departments best electives regardless.\r\n\r\nInstructor:\r\n\tProfessor Parr is very nice and engaged with the course and students. He stays in lab for the entire experiment, provides clear, step by step guidance and is very forgiving of mistakes. He gives extensive comment by comment feedback on all your work. However, he is a bit too concerned about formatting, publishing and ACS style than some of the actual scientific difficulties and understanding. Too much time was spent on formatting and very little reward was given for higher order scientific analysis in the reports\r\n\tProfessor Ganim is very excited about teaching and does a great job lecturing. His enthusiasm makes the second half quite fun and new. He actively seeks feedback and is very responsive to criticism and adjusting to suboptimal circumstances. I think he needs to coordinate a bit more with the TA and explain the lab questions/assignments more. He can get very ambitious and jump to very complicated math and ideas at the end and it just feels like a flurry of information no one is able to absorb. It is unclear how much of that info was used in the assignments but it was difficult to retain regardless. He also assumes a bit too much knowledge about optics in the beginning\r\n\tBoth professors are lenient (to a fault) and award great grades more for hard work and effort and (far) less for accuracy or quality\r\nCourse content:\r\n\tThe class is rightfully considered a very different one in the Chemistry department. It teaches material that very few other classes cover (Inorganic Chemistry to some extent)\r\n\tThe mythical quantum dots and graphene sheets you read about online feel demystified and simpler after this class, including their limitations\r\nAssignments:\r\n\tThe limited reading helps to engage with the class with limited stress\r\n\tThe lab reports are very well spaced apart and there is a lot of time to work on them, get the professors feedback and go back and forth for perfection \r\n\tThe one pre-lab assignment in optics was a good idea\r\nThe lab work itself is insanely tedious, especially in the second half. In the first half too, no labs end earlier than 5 pm, by which time one is exhausted and has very little motivation to understand what happened. More importantly, in the second half, the work feels mechanical and mindless. Regardless of how much order and logic is purported by the professor and TA, the optics alignments were random and just a test of fine motor skills. Often the problems (sudden misalignment, bad bacteria, defects/scars on images etc) were ununderstandable, frustrating, unsolvable and nonsensical. I guess not much can be done about this but the class should continue to increase focus on the optical concepts and analysis and reduce the current emphasis on alignment skills (which barely felt like real skills). The lab room for the second half with one lab partner and a TA is claustrophobic and taxing\r\nImprovements:\r\n\t1st half: dont cut points for small, silly formatting errors but encourage perfection. Reward students who put in extra effort for the science and analysis. Some of the science e.g. semiconductors, fluorescence transitions could be explained more clearly in class because they were hard / use the board more and the slides less (the slides feel like a burst of info)\r\n2nd half: focus more on the science and concepts and less on the mechanical grunt work. Focus on quality, not quantity of content in the lectures and explain the fundamental optics/physics/math concepts rather than jumping to very complex applications and literature experiments . We should never be asked to remake an apparatus (not even Module 1) we have already made the week before - it should be pre-set up so we can focus on the results. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to chemistry majors looking to fulfill the advance lab requirement. It was fun and intellectually stimulating. I was exposed to areas of chemistry I hadn't been in other Yale lecture and lab classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class! Prof. Ganim and Dr. Parr are both very committed to student learning and motivated to teach. The workload is reasonable, and all the work you do feels like it pays off (no busywork). You will actually learn useful skills + interesting material. This class ties in things you learned in previous chemistry courses, strengthening your understanding of previous knowledge, while introducing new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Every lab is interesting, engaging, and unique. The lab reports are straightforward, and the lectures are clear and engaging. Dr. Parr and Professor Ganim are great instructors. This course is the most interesting and rewarding lab course offered at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend for chemistry majors! Really helps you to understand content because you are using advanced techniques and then writing/analyzing everything after. The professors are great at answering questions, and the experiments are pretty cool, too. "
