I gained the knowledge and skills to think about the ways two seemingly unrelated disciplines can come together to create a new field that prioritizes the values of both fields to work toward a common goal and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I built both a robust understanding of basic physics concepts from classical and modern physics as well as choreographic strategies. I also learnt about the history of each discipline and the challenges and advantages of interdisciplinary work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about both physics and dance as well as how the two inform each other. I learned about choreographic research and technique and though a lot about how we engage with the forces of gravity and the laws of physics every day. I also learned a lot about collaborating in a small group when it comes to physical activity AND academic pursuit. ",

            "\u00a0We learned basic classical and modern physics, which is not very difficult even if you didn't take any physics in high school. There were eight physics-based problem sets (which sometimes brought in some dance positions/concepts we'd learned) over the course of the semester. These were fairly straightforward, with about a week to get them done and enough time to work with friends or ask the TF/professor for help.\r\n\r\nWe also learned basic dance warm-ups, which most often started each class. At the beginning of the semester, we were assigned choreographic groups of three or four people, with whom we worked the whole semester on weekly choreographic assignments that got more complex as the semester went along and culminated in a three- to five-minute long dance piece. ",
            "\u00a0Using physics as a lens to investigate dance, and using dance as a lens to investigate physics. Might sound confusing, but take the course to find out what Emily Coates and Sarah Demers are all about! It's pretty cool stuff.  This course teaches you how to think interdisciplinarily. If that's a word. ",

            "\u00a0LOVED the professors and general interdisciplinary approach of the class! These were two subjects I never thought I'd study at Yale, so it was great to explore. \r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this class is it TAKES UP SO MUCH TIME, many hours more than any of my other classes this semester: 4 hours of class a week, plus the time it takes to do readings, problem sets, and choreography assignments--an additional 2-3 hours--most weeks. This made be a little bitter about doing so many theater-style warmups in class, especially when it was so difficult (and so little time) to meet with working groups for choreography assignments later in the week. \r\n\r\nAlso, we received very clear feedback (in grades) with the physics assignments we were given, but it would have been nice to have some sort of metric for understanding how well we were executing the choreography and dance elements. ",
            "\u00a0Theres a very good balance between the two disciplines - the professors work hard to give equal weight and time to both physics and dance. The classes are enjoyable and dynamic - it never gets monotonous. The balance of p-sets and choreographic assignments kept my brain exercised in a positive, refreshing way. Both Professor Coates and Professor Demers are incredibly knowledgeable and accomplished in their respective fields, and theyre also very good at teaching those concepts to students and keeping them engaged in a way that is exciting and enriching. There is a fair amount of outside of class time commitment, but Im not sure if theres a direct solution to make that easier on the students. It would have been nice to receive a little feedback on our choreographic work at some point in the semester because its a large portion of the grade and we never really got an indication of how we were doing or if we were going in the right direction. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible class taught by two inspiring and dedicated professors. I took it for the SC and couldn't think of a more fun way to get this requirement out of the way. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. I don't think I would do anything differently. The material was always presented in an engaging way and one thing that I really appreciated was that there was no assumption that we already knew something about the physics OR the dance. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught physics well, but was limited in establishing a basic vocabulary in which to learn and understand primarily modern dance. ",
            "\u00a0This course, being interdisciplinary, was structured so that people who were familiar with neither dance nor physics going in could get a good grasp of the material. The result was that we didn't really delve deeply into any topics. It is too basic for people with knowledge of physics and/or dance. The physics lessons are often (too) slow, and I feel like we could have learned so much more actual dance technique or about dance styles than we did, since the warm-up was very simple and repetitive. It would have been more interesting to dedicate each week or one class per week to studying a choreographer or choreographic movement. \r\n\r\nThat said, I understand this was not intended to be a class on the history of physics or of dance, but I feel like my education in both was lacking. It felt like the way to relate them both and make the study truly \"interdisciplinary\" was to extract them from their typical context within their respective fields and relate them by their association with real life. The class made me more aware of both in real life, and it was cool to see what I'd learn appear in unexpected places during my day, but I don't feel like either discipline was shown profoundly in all its depth and complexity. That is always difficult to do, of course, but I think the boundary can be pushed more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: invigorating physical warm-up, good physics explanations, cool guest workshop, cool in-class physics experiments, some interesting readings.\r\nWeaknesses: Much assigned group work with no scheduling assistance--would have appreciated a scheduled time billed alongside the course like a section. Unclear criteria for essay questions on tests. Very unclear syllabus--I went in to the class thinking the group work was only for the final project, only to discover it was in fact due every week or so, plus deadlines were scattered confusingly across two separate sections of the syllabus and changed a lot in ways that were hard to follow. Disciplines seemed a little like ships passing in the night even though there was a lot of big talk about interdisciplinary practice and \"poetics.\" Also a lot of big talk about non-Western dance forms, but besides the guest it seemed like the dance principles discussed were exclusively haute-modern and research-intellectual. (That would be fine if the course was operating under the explicit assumption that that's the sort of dance that belongs in the classroom, but the class kind of acted like it was representing *all* dance, but then didn't really represent dance-as-fun or dance-as-musical-art or dance-as-ritual-communication, which are some of the forms it takes outside the work of Cunningham and his ilk.) Because of this emphasis, it seemed like the guest workshop came out of nowhere curricularly. ",
            "\u00a0It almost feels redundant to give more feedback in course evals as we discussed this question a lot throughout the course! I think the class excels because it has such dynamic and knowledgeable teachers and combines two such seemingly different but fascinating and intertwined disciplines. The class was so well planned and flowed seamlessly, I could tell the teachers put a ton of effort into designing it. I loved the working groups even though they were a hefty time commitment and appreciated how much collaboration we had throughout the course. It made learning about physics a lot more fun and memorable!\r\n\r\nTime time time - the working groups were hard to schedule! And sometimes the in-class physics lectures seemed a bit disorganized, or were just a little hard to follow in relation to the homework. I ended up Googling a lot of answers to the homework, as I find it really hard to learn math from a textbook, and sometimes found it hard to connect them both. I would have liked a little more constructive criticism about the products of my working group throughout, however I also enjoyed how not having this criticism opened our horizons and made us less focused on a grade when doing the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0It at time felt like a lot of work and like I was taking a both a physics class and dance class for only one credit, but the conversations we had were interesting and both teachers were really invested and excited about the class. We had to meet weekly outside of class with a group of other students to choreograph which was at times a burden to organize and not entirely fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy how the class has both physical aspects and aspects that are more traditional lecture style -- the mix keeps it engaging. I really disliked the group work because it seemed juvenile to depend on peers for my grades at the collegiate level. ",
            "\u00a0The working groups were wonderful. The friction between the courses was useful, as was the self-consciousness of the course. It was sort of like being in one long TED talk. I felt like I should be having a maybe more revelatory experience than I was. In general, the course was very well organized and encouraged thought at many levels. "

            "\u00a0With reservations. Really great idea, and especially cool when there are visiting dancers//you're trying to pirouette//you get to talk about CERN and fun physics concepts, but truly takes up way too much time. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Class itself is interesting, dynamic and fun. Professors Coates and Demers are incredible and so helpful and engaging. You have to put in a lot to the class and commit to your working group, but it ends up being very fulfilling and worthwhile. The balance between science and dance is perfect, and the science is very understandable to someone majoring in a humanities discipline, especially if youve had some exposure to physics before. And if you ever need help, theyre all very accessible to help and provide feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Class takes place in the studio and I really enjoyed switching between dance and physics. Professors Demers and Coates are wonderful. The workload is fair but not hard. ",
            "\u00a0I was so excited to take this course when I got into it. Regretfully it lived up to none of my expectations. I would not recommend this course if you have any physics background whatsoever. This course has all of the worst aspects of a gut without having the benefit of being a class you can spend less time on. Meeting almost four hours a week, plus problem sets, plus finding time to meet with groups and \"choreograph\" leads to a large time commitment for very little return. I thought the premise of the class was fascinating and was excited to see where it would go. Unfortunately the course was ultimately unfulfilling: academically, intellectually, and artistically. ",
            "\u00a0If you like to move and wish you had a scheduled time to explore goofy things dance can be, this class is great.\r\nI took Physics of Dance with the hopes of gaining some exposure to the practices of dance as an artistic medium, and in this respect the class delivered. I also loved having a twice-a-week time to get in my body and focus on the experience of moving in a space, a constant state of being which we all otherwise take for granted. Just doing that assured I always left class feeling better than when I entered. As far as the physics go, its all very simple stuff if you have any background in the topic. The emphasis of the class is on exploring where the overlap between physics and dance (and more generally: science and art) can be. Combining the two is a tough task, and the teachers are very aware of that fact, doing generally as well as could be expected and constantly asking for ideas to help improve the course.\r\nThe workload is pretty major, with psets, weekly choreography assignments and reading responses in addition to two midterms and a final, so know that this isn't a gut. The grading is very forgiving though. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to other students. It is engaging, interesting and was always one of the highlights of my day. Sarah and Emily are SUCH a dynamic duo and Mariel is AMAZING and all three really contributed to the amazing atmosphere of the class. It is an eye-opening experience to look at two things that are seemingly so different come together in such a way. The interdisciplinary approach to learning about physics and dance really gives you a different outlook on things. You can see the give and take between the two so clearly which allows you to see the give and take between other subjects we study as well. As someone who wasn't a dancer as a child or took physics in high school, I have learned so much and I can say that if you want to take physics or learn about dance THIS is the way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone without a strong background in either physics or dance, because if you have either it tends to be boring. It is also relatively a fair amount of work, with weekly psets, readings, and choreographic assignments that take one to several hours each, depending on their level of detail. The professors, however, are very passionate about what they teach and want to see their students learn and push themselves and do well. If only to get to know them, it is worth it. It is a not gut, which makes it more fulfilling and in the end I do not regret taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it! I took it expecting it to be an easy way to knock out a science credit. I was right in that the science aspect of the course wasn't too challenging, as most of it was basic physics concepts (later in the course, we did get into cool stuff like special relativity and dark matter); however, I wasn't expecting the dance portion to be so engaging and enlightening. Learned a lot of cool stuff about different choreographic techniques. There were also many conversations about the sociological and anthropological aspects of dance, which I thought made the course even more interesting. The course was A TON of work though. There were weekly problem sets and pretty frequent reading responses, but on TOP of that, you had to meet outside of class with your choreographic group pretty often and for multiple hours. We had to present some work of choreography pretty much every other week, and each presentation required at least 2 hours of time outside of class to meet and choreograph. If you take this course, be prepared to put in the work because it can yield some pretty cool pieces and insights about physics and dance. ",
            "\u00a0Probably the best info I can give you on this one is my \"strengths and weaknesses\" question, which for some reason they don't publish. \r\nStrengths: invigorating physical warm-up, good physics explanations, friendly to the QR-averse, cool guest workshop (an Indian classical dancer), cool in-class physics experiments (ballet partnering as measured by force plates, e.g.), some interesting readings.\r\nWeaknesses: Much assigned group work with no scheduling assistance--would have appreciated a scheduled time billed alongside the course like a section, instead of the \"find a time that works\" instruction, which led everyone to flake out on each other because they were beholden only to peers and not to authority figures for the practice times. Unclear criteria for essay questions on tests. Very unclear syllabus--I went in to the class thinking the group work was only for the final project, only to discover it was in fact due every week or so, plus deadlines were scattered confusingly across two separate sections of the syllabus and changed a lot in ways that were hard to follow. Disciplines seemed a little like ships passing in the night even though there was a lot of big talk about interdisciplinary practice and \"poetics.\" Also a lot of big talk about non-Western dance forms, but besides the guest it seemed like the dance principles discussed were exclusively haute-modern and research-intellectual.

Because of this emphasis, it seemed like the guest workshop came out of nowhere curricularly. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A really interesting dive into both disciplines of physics and dance, and a great way to learn about physics through a humanities lens and vice versa, though i do think non-science majors will benefit more from the approach to physics than the other way around. Know that this class will take a lot of time in your schedule, but that the time is well worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Don't take as an easy science/QR class because the class has a pretty sizable workload that wasn't always enjoyable -- esp. weekly psets and working group meetings. A lot of emphasis was on the relationship between science and art which at times feels forced but was interesting ",
            "\u00a0The course should instead be called Physics and Dance because the course is not as expected and does not necessarily try to explain dance concepts with physics. It isn't investigating the physics of dance moves as one may think. It is much more abstract and the connection between the two seems all too forced. You do some strange modern dance activities and some very basic physics followed by some modern physics and try to connect the two. The course is quite strange and I'm not really sure how much I actually learned by putting these two subjects together. I did enjoy dancing and having time set aside every week to do something physical in the classroom. That being said, I wish I would have been warned about how integral group work is to this class. You are put into a choreographic group and have to find to meet with them every week. Not only does this mean that you are spending a lot of time on this course (4 hours of class a week + at least 1 hour of group dance work + psets + course readings), but it also means that you have to depend on other students for your grades. This may be a personal preference, but I really dislike that and it feels somewhat juvenile. I understand its importance to the course, but actually doing it was often a little too much to handle. I could see the class as being really valuable to dancer if it were truly the physics of dance, but since it's more physics and dance and bridging an unclear connection between the two, it left me wondering what the point of the course was and if I even learned much.
