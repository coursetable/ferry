Lectures feel more like a multi-way conversation often, which is informative and impressive that Howie is able to tailor the class this way.\r\nWeaknesses- the final questions were fair but the grading was very picky. Many of the SOM students were not as committed to working on the final project, the class may be better if taught by Howie still but at YSPH or the med school. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is very beneficial given that it provides an overview of the US healthcare system. Given that it is similar to an undergrad course, I feel as though some more practical applications rather than rote memorization of detail would be more helpful/applicable at the graduate level. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is learning about all areas relevant to US healthcare and its current state\r\nWeakness is that its mostly cursory and can't cover all these topics in depth. I would like to have questions that test more than memorization. \r\nThe final project is somewhat arbitrary given there is no specific technique we learned that should be applied to the presentation. Seems just like an assignment for the sake of having an assignment. ",

It would have been nice to have a midterm (or short quizzes throughout the semester) rather than  just one final at the end so that we could stay on top of the material and better evaluate our understanding of the content. Loved the review sessions and thought that they were very helpful. Emily was an amazing TA!\r\n\r\nIt often felt hard to participate because class was dominated by several students who asked a lot of questions (felt like the participation component was geared towards individuals with an already higher level of understanding or familiarity of the content). Would have appreciated more opportunities for discussion. ",

The workload is very light until the final project, which became a bit all-consuming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would like to see the class draw on the readings or perhaps cases to have a richer discussion in class. Also, I actually really valued the financial analysis portion of the final project but don't think that there was enough structured support for it given the general lack of experience, especially with DCFs. It would be great to spend class time or a review session on how to do this, and special considerations relevant to healthcare. ",
