            "\u00a0I developed familiarity with the theory of poetic influence as it applies to the Romantics and Victorians. I also gained a sense of the salient characteristics of the Victorian Era and a better eye for ambiguity in complex poems. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough understanding of the major themes, concerns, and dynamics of Victorian poetry, with particular emphasis on Tennyson and Browning, and with constant attention to the legacy of Romanticism. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improve my critical reading and appreciation of Victorian poetry. I also learned how to put the poets on our syllabus in conversation with one another in the essays I wrote, which made the subject material even richer and my writing about it more insightful since I felt I had a better grasp on the period of Victorian poetry in its entirety instead of just focusing on poet by poet. ",
            "\u00a0This course is broken into four \"units\": Romantics and Victorians (the influence of the Romantic poets, especially Shelley, on the Victorian poets), Tennyson, Browning, and Fallen Women (two classes spent on poems about fallen women). You will write one essay after each of the first three units, and the page count for all three must be 21-25 pages. The focus is heavily on Tennyson and Browning, though you'll read a good sampling of other Victorians, including D.G. Rossetti, Christina Rossetti, Swinburne, and Hardy. You will read several poems (or one long poem) for each class, which is focused around one or two central themes. The discussion is based on close-reading the text, guided by Mr. Brisman's excellent questions. This course will expose you to poetry you may never have read but should read, and Mr. Brisman's guidance will allow you to become a stronger reader and critic of poetry. Your writing ability will certainly improve if you heed his comments. ",
            "\u00a0Deep understanding of Victorian poetry and its relationship to Romantic poetry. Special focus on Browning and Tennyson. "

            "\u00a0The best part of this course is Professor Brisman, who is simply incredible. The pairings of poems for each day were also so thought-provoking, and there was a nice mix of pairings assigned to us beforehand and pairings achieved through handouts in class. This was an above average seminar, but sometimes we did spend a lot of time on one specific bit of language or the comments of one specific student and it was harder to be engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was an exceedingly strong course, and I have greatly enjoyed all of it. While the particular focus on Tennyson and Browning is primarily a strength, I would also appreciate a bit more exposure to Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Swinburne, and Hardy (especially in the first few weeks). Also, we could have done at least one session on Aurora Leigh, perhaps by paring down the unit on fallen women. ",
            "\u00a0Our class was a very small group with a very high level of engagement, which made the experience so much stronger. Professor Brismans feedback on essays is incredibly thorough and thoughtful, and his teaching of the material sparks excitement in each of his students. I walked away from this course with an even more urgent understanding of why these poems need to be read, read again, and written about, and that is a testament to Professor Brismans total devotion to the class and his students. No weaknesses of the course come to mind! ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent, intimate seminar that pushes students to think critically and engage deeply with the poetry they read. With a small class, students must participate often, and, because the course attracts committed readers of poetry, the discussion is always fruitful, thanks in particular to Mr. Brisman's guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful selection of poems and pacing of course. Seminar format and discussion were really excellent. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Take Professor Brisman and read these poems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you are not crazy about Victorian poetry, there is something for everyone in this course. Above all, these are some of the greatest poems in English literature, and Professor Brisman's teaching makes them all the more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want the greatest intellectual challenge and reward from studying English poetry at Yale, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a fantastic course, and a great senior seminar to take to fulfill part of your senior requirement. If you take it as one of your senior seminars, you will write three essays around a central theme that you will combine into one, three-part essay by the end, which will be around 30 pages. Not only is this poetry is worthy of such prolonged attention but it is so multifaceted that you are certain to find many things to interest you in it. Take this course if you want to read great poetry and discuss it in depth with a professor who is incredibly passionate about the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is an excellent course which should be mandatory for any student of poetry. "
