            "\u00a0Great way to foster community in the math major! As a girl who had often felt excluded socially (and in study groups) from her peers, this class and Pat gave me a great network of people not only to study with, but also gave me the opportunity to meet older math majors and hear their advice. Pat did a fantastic job of making the environment supportive for everyone and the class itself was more of a fun time than anything else. ",

The course was a structured approach to studying and preparing for the exam, with Pat preparing a lot of wonderful notes for us to use to prep for the competition. Most of the skills are the usual math tricks, this course merely sharpened them and kept them relevant in my mind for the exam. ",

Each class often had some sort of theme, going over way to use specific strategies for different types of problems. ",

Perhaps it was the fun, accepting environment, but somehow a lot of stuff just clicked this time around, and some of it actually helped remedy some deep, hidden concepts that I had left misunderstood or ill-understood years ago, which in turn just made me feel a lot more confident as a mathematician, even if my competition performance did not skyrocket. That said, I'm pretty sure I did better on the Putnam than I would have without going through this class (well, I guess it's probably not /too/ hard getting above a 1). "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the space for conversation and collaboration that this class provided; however, I felt like I couldn't get enough! Perhaps the course could be scheduled for a longer period of time, and/or have problems assigned and attempted for credit. Segregation of the rooms into strictly quieter/louder rooms might also be helpful. ",

            "\u00a0This class is interesting, fun, and extremely low-stress. The biggest problem with the course was the decision to split the class into two class rooms: the \"Fast-and-Loose\" room, and the \"Slow-and-Thorough\" room. This enforced a divide between more confident (but not necessarily more competent) mathematicians and less confident ones, which I believe was detrimental to all of us. My understanding was that one intention of the class was to foster community among math undergraduates, and the splitting of the class worked against that goal. It also made learning more difficult, as the professors' and TAs' time and attention was split between two groups. ",
            "\u00a0It was really great!! The instructors were able to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, and it was a nice mixture of independent work and instruction. Their enthusiasm was also great. I do wish we had spent more time going over solutions, or received solutions to the last weeks problems the following week. Many questions that stumped me, I ultimately did not find out the solution for, and I think it would have been valuable to go over 2-3 questions at the start, rather than 1-2. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good course, I think a little more teaching of material as in the beginning would be nice, or at least an option for people, and I think a quiet room to work on the problems without chatter would be cool ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths include the relaxed nature of the course where everyone was welcome to join and where everyone was very excited to learn about math. At the same time the lax nature of the course lends itself to being overwhelmed by a lot of students, including those who are serious about the exam and those who are not. Another major strength I think helped with prepping for the exam was the structure of how the material was presented in that every week had a different topic/strategy for the exam. A last weakness, because there were a lot of students and not as many faculty it was hard to get help and feedback regarding the problems we were working on. ",
            "\u00a0It was fun, but pretty unstructured ",
            "\u00a0I though this course was great overall and loved that it was so interactive. For me, I would have liked to learn a little bit more. This math was often above my head, which made it hard to just sit down and do any of the problems on my own. It would have been nice to have an option that was a little more intensive of teaching, just so I would be able to learn more about how to solve these problems on my own. ",
            "\u00a0A great course for building community within the math major and also doing fun problems! I have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely chill class. However, many students weren't really motivated (kinda wanted to find a free .5 credit). I personally liked working on the problems, but even still didn't feel quite motivated enough to work on problems outside of class. I was always a math competition person, but there's not a lot of time outside of class, and I suppose I don't value the Putnam quite enough. Without the credit though, I probably wouldn't have gone to the sessions, embarrassingly enough. The credit really gives a slight reward to putting in the hours every week, giving me an excuse mentally for spending time on preparing for the Putnam rather than doing my other coursework. ",

Just seeing that type of problem and having a little practice solving them is helpful. Also, Pat is a really fun professor who cares a lot about the math community at Yale--this class is very social, and a great way to feel connected to the math community as well. ",

Competition math may seem like something youre good at or youre not, but it turns out there are a whole bunch of learnable, useful techniques, and practice does help.
