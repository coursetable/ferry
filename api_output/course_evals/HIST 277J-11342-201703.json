            "\u00a0I learned about the complicated relationship between memory and history, how to critically analyze texts, and how to question the understanding of how we study history over time. ",
            "\u00a0This class not only helped me as a history major, but it made me a better student in general. The readings were difficult at times, but after this semester I feel as though I can succeed with any readings that a class requires. Additionally, I have become more aware of my own writing process and have learned to be much more careful and thoughtful. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a variety of theoretical tools for assessing the relationship between history and memory. Also a fair amount about the representation of history in museums, monuments, memorials, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the course we read many key theoretical texts relating to memory studies. As a result, for me, this formed the beginning of a working vocabulary as to what the conversation around memory studies is. While many of these texts are quite dense and I find myself still thinking through them to process their significance as well as their applications in the writing and study of history, I've found that it has given me the necessary vocabulary to engage with further work done in the area. It has, at least, given me a starting point to work from and texts to refer back to in the future. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Professor Allen spends a lot of time commenting on and working on our essays and your writing does improve a bunch over the semester. Classes are also highly engaged and I don't think I've ever felt as present or as captivated by class discussions as I have in this seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Allen provided more detailed, substantive, and specific feedback than I've received in any course during my time here at Yale. Her criticism has made me a better writer and forced me to really challenge myself. \r\n\r\nThe balance of theory and real-world examples engendered some meaningful historical thought. Historical memory is a fascinating concept, and I'm sure I'll carry it with me into other courses. ",
            "\u00a0The most important thing I learned was to think critically about where knowledge comes from. This course taught me to contextualize history, understand how they might be used, and to understand how groups can remember things. I learned how memory and history go together. I also learned how memory is institutionalized with monuments and the like.  Skills: I found that my writing must be very clear. Very precise.  I learned how to read books like a historian ought to. I learned how to read a monograph very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory surrounding the concept of historical memory. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Allen runs a tight ship.  But if you're open to honest feedback on your writing, you should definitely take the class!  This is the best-run seminar I've ever been in.  Largely because of Professor Allen's guiding of discussion, class always went smoothly and I felt like I learned a lot in class, which is not a guarantee in seminars these days.  I was always excited for class, because it actually deepened my understanding of the course material. ",

            "\u00a0I think it is a great discussion course. Professor Allen leads a great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course, but specifically I loved the second half of the course. I've never really engaged with any sort of philosophy or sociology, and it was certainly challenging. The tangible history was much easier to grasp onto, and in that way it was more fulfilling. However, I do believe that the class is structured in a very thoughtful and meaningful way, and I probably wouldn't change it at all. (I loved the book about the Bastille and the Sins of the Fathers.) ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong class with a well thought-out syllabus and great support for developing as a writer and historian. A lot of the class was taking it Cr/D, so discussions were pretty relaxed. The final paper is due over Thanksgiving. In general, assignments were paced well though. Weaknesses - posting discussion questions on Canvas seemed pointless, since we went over the same ground in the class presentations anyway. The final 2-page reflection was too vague to feel useful. You can tell that Professor Allen puts a lot of thought and energy into this class. ",
            "\u00a0I do feel like grading for the course was fairly strict and that was difficult as a student but I recognise that it's a decision that Prof Allen makes and the class is definitely worth taking regardless of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible, and the level of attention to detail that Professor Allen gave to this course was honestly tremendous.\r\n\r\nThe reading load was intense, and would have been a bit much for most other courses, but the sheer quality of the course motivated me to do it. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would have liked to see room in discussions to think beyond each week's reading and to answer some of the broader questions that the course raises. I think the readings were so meaty that it would have been hard to cut specific discussion of them short, but I think it would still have been worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jen Allen gives detailed feedback. Her expectations are very high, which pushes the whole class. The material is very interesting, and everyone who is in the class cares quite a bit. The final paper is due during Thanksgiving break, which makes the rest of your finals much better. Prof Allen is always very generous with her limited time and is committed to great students and great teaching.\r\n\r\nCons: I think this was an anomaly, but the discussion was sometimes pale. I think that people were afraid of Professor Allen, and I think that could have been combatted if Prof. could force people to carry on strains of thought, as in, making people move with others. What happened a lot was that people had their own two cents put in, but the ideas never rubbed against each other. There wasn't debate around central issues. I appreciated Allen's hands-off approach-- it's important to develop free thought-- but I think Allen should direct the conversation more by knowing exactly what points she wants to bring out of the reading and making sure we leave the class with those points understood. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great course! I think the best part was that Professor Allen really expected a lot from us in terms of our level of engagement, and this brought out the best from everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The Gross should be eliminated from the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0very intellectually challenging, high workload, and extremely rewarding. The course challenges the traditional history student to re-engage history with other disciplines, and formulate a new framework to think about history "

        [
            "\u00a0I took this course because I thought the material would be interesting and that it would be a healthy challenge. Both are true. This course, if you don't have a foundation of philosophy, can be more difficult in understanding the first few readings and having the confidence to speak in class among a group of what seems to be more qualified people. This is the hardest class I have taken at Yale, but I am happy that I did in the end. Getting to hear people's opinions on the topic of memory and history if fascinating, because no one seems to have the same definition. I also think it is great to take this class as a history major, because you realize throughout the course that you are really studying how what you are studying (history) has evolved and the relationship memory has to that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed this class and appreciated the way it both engaged with theoretical discussions of history and memory and also looked at historical applications/manifestations of those theories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- but only if you actually put the effort in. If you apply yourself in this class, it can be one of the most rewarding things you do. Professor Allen is an amazing and brilliant person, and getting to interact with her is so lovely. She really helps you become a better writer and reader, pushing you to do better but never in a way that is overly stressful. She genuinely wants you to be a better writer and thinker in general, so the skills learned from this class are applicable to everything. Jennifer Allen is the best professor I have had at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in learning about what history means in the world, take this course! While the material can be a little abstract and hard to grasp sometimes, this class will absolutely change the way you think about history itself and how you relate to the past. The grading is not easy (maybe take it credit/D), but Allen does give very detailed (and sometimes brutal) feedback on your writing. Take the class for the stimulating discussions and a marked improvement in your writing, not for the grade. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend taking the class if you enjoy the more philosophical/social theory side of historical analysis. There aren't a huge number of Yale classes where you can get this perspective, and it definitely helped me answer the question of why I'm a history major. I came to have a new appreciation for the role of the historian and the often flimsy historical facts underneath collective memories. The workload is very high, so I'd plan on this being one of the classes that you primarily focus on in the semester. In the second half of the class, no one reads the whole monograph every week and it shows in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Very much so. I loved a lot of the texts we read for this class and they're definitely texts I will go back to over the course of my study at Yale. Additionally, I really enjoyed just being there in seminar and being engaged with the rest of the class in discussion. Prof Allen is a great discussion leader and really helps to keep discussion on track as well as gives us very specific parts of the text to work from when we get stuck, which both helps to further the conversation as well as ensure that our lessons are fully engaged with the texts. It makes it such that even though there's a lot of reading each week, it always feels worth it to read all of it. \r\n\r\nHowever, you do have to be interested in memory/ theoretical work to enjoy this class I think. Some comments I have heard from other students who have not enjoyed it as much have definitely been because they did not enjoy the theoretical perspective it took, one that is less common to history and more common to the social sciences? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a tough course that will demand a lot from you. You can't coast by without deeply engaging with the material, but it's absolutely worth it. It's a kind of terrifying experience, but an equally fantastic one. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. Very challenging, but very rewarding. Material is interesting in and of itself. Allen is very responsive and attentive and critical and demanding. She makes you want to be better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course! It's excellent. Jennifer Allen is a tough grader, and you really need to carefully do all of the readings, but despite the challenge (or perhaps because of it) I really gained a lot from the course. ",
            "\u00a0You must take this class!  Especially if you want to make your writing more clear and concise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are willing to take up the time and energy to put in to the readings. they average about 200 pages or more a week, and are usually quite dense. It is not simply fact-based inquiries, but also philosophical and literary investigations. Memory studies is fascinating- it requires an open mind and interdisciplinary eye. "
