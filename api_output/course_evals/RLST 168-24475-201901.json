            "\u00a0Knowledge: This course provides a very well-structured introduction to Catholic intellectual thought up to the 20th century and then dives deep into 20th century Catholic theology with discussions of Vatican II, liberation theology, feminist theology, and a handful of other writings. Professor Thiel has a very deep base of knowledge, so your questions will receive thought-provoking answers.\r\n\r\nSkills: Theological writing. If you haven't written a theology paper in an academic setting before, it may be challenging the first time but Professor Thiel's feedback will help you move forward.\r\n\r\nInsights: A lot. The readings provide analyses of some incredibly relevant and important questions surrounding God, religion, and modernity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot from the readings, which I though were unconventional for a typical religious studies course but still relevant to the study of the course. Discussion was always stimulating and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the different theological ideas of catholic theologians in the modern era. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the development of the Catholic Church that resulted from Vatican II. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, analyze, and write theology. It exposed me to a wide range of brilliant theological thinkers to whom I would've never otherwise been exposed. It also improved my analytical skills, and Professor Thiel's feedback helped me write better argumentative essays and incorporate counter-arguments into my writing. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Thiel's lectures. His knowledge and passion for the material result in really engaging and thought-provoking classes. In some ways, it felt almost like a season of a TV series; each lecture had a plot, twists and turns, and often some form of a resolution or cliff-hanger. On a bigger level, each lecture contributes to the arc of the course as they explore new takes on familiar themes (e.g. sin, grace, modern technology, conceptions of Christ, the evolving institutional structure of the Church, tensions between liberal and conservative modes of thought). \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None in particular! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Thiel always conducted the discussion of the readings in an engaging manner but also facilitated student-directed discussion as well, so it felt very comfortable and free. The readings were always interesting, which I think is rare for a Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great and very engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. It was interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think there are any glaring weaknesses, though I suppose a little more discussion might have made the class more dynamic. That being said, I always appreciated that Professor Thiel spent large portions of class unpacking the theology for us, because some of it was quite complicated and it would've been pointless for us to discuss something we didn't understand. The strengths were the diversity of authors and theological styles we read, Professor Thiel's excellent pedagogy, and overall structure of the course. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student, especially if you haven't taken a theology course before. The lectures were excellent, the readings addressed questions that I think most Yalies grapple with (i.e. how to make sense of uncertainty regarding religion, in this case Catholicism, in an increasingly fragmented and secular world), and Professor Thiel cares a lot about the material and his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely--this course gives a more liberal and different take on theology and is definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great religious studies class and the material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about Catholicism in the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0If the subject interests you, it's an absolutely fascinating and rewarding course. There's theology here for everyone, from existentialists to conservatives to those more interested in social justice. The reading was always fascinating and thought-provoking, and class discussions were illuminating. Professor Thiel is awesome and provides lots of feedback that will improve your writing. "
