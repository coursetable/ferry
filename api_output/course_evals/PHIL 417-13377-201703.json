            "\u00a0Basic overview of critical theory and how it is situated within the context of Western philosophy. Overall a very worthwhile and interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better reader of philosophy, and learned about a school of philosophical thought totally new to me. I became a better synthesizer and communicator of arguments. I became more critical of the texts I read. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a thorough introduction to the texts of the Frankfurt School, covering topics like theory and practice, human agency, the effect of modern society on the individual, all placed in the context of Europe and the United States in the 60s. Nonetheless, we also \"practiced\" critical theory on the texts themselves, questioning assumptions, positions, and implications of its suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of philosophy texts. ",
            "\u00a0Foundational knowledge of critical theory, methodology of analysis in applied and philosophical critical theory, knowledge of intellectual history on the topic. ",
            "\u00a0A familiarity with western marxism and the thought of the frankfurt school. It also provided me with an ability to think dialectically and to apply a kind of ideology critique to the culture that surrounds me. ",
            "\u00a0Skills to read critical theory and continental philosophy\r\nSkills to read philosophical texts and link common strands between texts\r\nCritical reading and thinking skills\r\ninsights into the relationship between culture, material conditions, etc. to individual psychology and societal progress\r\ninsights into how progress is not always progress\r\nexperience reading difficult texts ",
            "\u00a0Being able to understand the complexities involved in constructing an argument "

        [
            "\u00a0The material is fascinating and Prof. Angermann did a great job designing the syllabus such that we were exposed to a broad range of ideas in critical theory but could clearly see how each reading was related to the next. Class could be more engaging; Prof. Angermann lectures most of the time, pausing occasionally to ask questions of students, but for the most part there is very little class discussion. I think a class like this would benefit greatly from class discussion, although it was difficult this year because we had such a large class, and also I think that the students in the class were all from very different backgrounds (div school students, undergrad philosophy majors, students from other fields). I think that range made it hard for there to be any common ground. Maybe we should have spent a class reviewing some of the foundations of critical theory (Marx, Hegel, etc.) before moving on to the Frankfurt School thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I found most of the readings interesting, and I thought the immersive quality of the course--reading only texts from one school of thought, which differed in methodology and content but shared approaches in common--helped me think in a new way. Some weeks there was a ton of reading, and some weeks there was very little, so the balance could have been better. The essays were assigned rather late in the semester, so I felt less engaged in the beginning, when I wasn't really doing any of my own synthesis except for reading and discussing. ",
            "\u00a0The texts are highly engaging and urgently importnat; however, the class often ran a bit dry, focusing on the language of the opening pages and the background of the writer. Student participation was hit-or-miss, but when it occurred, very interesting critiques of the criticism arose. ",
            "\u00a0I think the selection of readings is a big strength for this class; it gives a very comprehensive overview of the main thinkers and texts of the Frankfurt School. I think a possible way to help students interact with the texts in addition to the papers could be short reading responses or group questions/forums. As the texts are sometimes quite difficult, this can be a good way to help students parse out difficult passages before the class (maybe by posting questions/comments on a Canvas discussion). ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly engaging course content, very well taught, very engaging seminar discussion and questions ",
            "\u00a0I think it would have helped to have one or two readings from either Marx or Hegel. If the class had been comprised of philosophy students this would not have been an issue, but a lot of my other classmates seemed to be lacking a familiarity with these thinkers. It seems hard to understand the frankfurt school without them. I thought the readings that were assigned were phenomenal, and Asaf is incredibly knowledgeable about all of the frankfurt school thinkers. I think the seminar could have been slightly smaller. ",
            "\u00a0Great syllabus. Liked all the readings and supplemental readings. However, the classroom discussions were a bit disorganized and did not cover all parts of the text. Often times, it seemed that the class discussion was too superficial, without references to text. For this reason, not many students were engaged in classroom discussions, so the overall seminar discussion fell somewhat flat and the classes were mostly lecture-based. ",
            "\u00a0It is helpful to read these texts in this kind of classroom context, that being said the class has to keep a pretty fast clip to keep up with the schedule and by the end of the semester we were maybe 3 weeks behind the reading in our in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: \r\nTOO many students enrolled in class, perhaps relative to complexity of topics involved. \r\nClass needs smaller assignments like weekly/biweekly reading responses- would help with digesting topics "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Definitely, especially if you have an interest in continental philosophy, political philosophy, or aesthetics. Or if you think philosophy is useless (the critical theorists may force you to reconsider). The ideas of these thinkers have been so influential and are present in many different disciplines, not just philosophy. Also, I found the readings very engaging and force you to think about how their ideas apply to society even today. Many of these books were written for mass audiences, and some of them became bestsellers in their time, so they're really accessible and fun to read. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who enjoy interdisciplinary thinking (you'll read about psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, economics, politics, literature, art, and more). The texts we read are radical and exciting. You have to enjoy reading dense, ornate texts to appreciate the readings, so it's not for everyone. But it was mind-opening. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the texts are required reading to be able to practice and think about policy and modernity writ large. Perhaps come in with a point to make to give the discussion a starting point, otherwise you'll likely find yourself rehearsing only the surface of a concept each week. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to philosophy majors and students keen on learning about the Frankfurt School. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend for anyone with a solid foundation in philosophy or critical theory writing, willing to take on complex concepts and attempt to apply them intellectually and socially. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course. These thinkers are very important to read, and Asaf is a great professor to read them with. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, provided that the quality of discussions improve. It is possible that this course would have been a lecture-style course. However, if it is seminar-based, it should include more opportunities to discuss the text in depth. The texts are difficult, so it would be a shame not to discuss difficult parts more in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should receive a rigorous introduction to Critical Theory. Still, I'm not sure if it was my professor or the class structure or what but this wasn't really a satisfying one. Was happy to read the texts, but found the class itself disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, useful to a multitude of disciplines "
