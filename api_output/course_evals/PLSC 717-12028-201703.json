            "\u00a0Strengths: All the issues we covered through the course were thought-provoking. They helped us to understand the trends of the world's political economy especially in the recent thirty years and the diversity of the relations between government and industry. The professor, who is highly distinguished in the field, and guest speakers with diverse backgrounds gave us multidimensional viewpoints.\r\nWeaknesses: The professors logistics was a little rough. There were several ambiguous descriptions in the syllabus, and his instruction sometimes changed. "
