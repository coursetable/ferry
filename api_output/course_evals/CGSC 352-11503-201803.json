            "\u00a0I actually learned a surprising amount about the myths and facts of the teen brain. ",
            "\u00a0This class focused in on neuroanatomical and neurobehavioral concepts specific to the adolescent brain, making it a manageable and interesting topic. The focus of the class made it evident how to incorporate this knowledge into daily decision making and interpretation of current events and issues. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what makes teenagers' brains different from those of children or adults. This class was very interesting because it looked at studies whose conclusions had real world applications both in people's personal lives and in the judicial system. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to look at psychological studies more in depth, and how to understand how the conclusions drawn from those studies could benefit fields like law. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the development of the brain and how this development affects self control during adolescence. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely nothing, the prof stopped teaching material in the middle of October and spent the rest of the semester repeating the little information we had already learned. Waste of a class, do yourself a favor and take something else more engaging ",
            "\u00a0The intricacies of adolescent-specific developments as we debate \"arrested\" or \"adaptive.\" The course covered various topics such as the teenage brain under peer influence, alcohol, social media, and advertisements, to tease out the developments of the brain from the subcortical to the cortical.

            "\u00a0Dr. Casey really made this class low stress while still helping us learn a lot. It was super clear and it felt like we were consistently reviewing over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely well-organized. Lectures made sense of complex ideas, clearly delineated what we needed to know, and made the material accessible to all students. Prof. Casey is exciting, engaging, and compassionate, as well as a leader in the field, making her an excellent teacher for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Casey is extremely good at conveying difficult psychology concepts in concise language. She makes complicated topics seem a lot easier than they should be, and the class' structure makes it easy to build off of each lecture. Content is frequently repeated across units, which only helps to drive the points of the class home. The debates are also very fun and a great way to get points across in creative ways!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though the repetition of the concepts throughout the course was appreciated, I think the slides got a little bit too repetitive at times. I think I would have liked some class time to be spent answering questions about the content or looking at more cool case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe there should be more grades? 3 grades is very little to base your whole grade on ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was organized very systematically, which was conducive to student learning and understanding. Each topic built on the previous one, and by the end they were all linked. I thought the lectures were captivating and often fun. \r\nThe center of the class, the debate, was a really great idea. However, I do not think that it was orchestrated very well, which meant that the debate itself was not that great. It might be improved by Professor Casey offering more information on the debate, structuring it more, and giving us more time in class with our specific groups to work on our presentation of arguments. Even so, it was a really fun and different way of learning and showing our knowledge. \r\nI wish the lecture slides made a little bit more sense, because when I went back to study for the exam, I couldn't always understand what the slides were arguing, and in class our Professor went so fast that occasionally I could not keep up with her, so I missed important points. ",

            "\u00a0I like the teaching style and structure of the material during the first half of the course - before the midterm. The professor and TA were approachable, and  there was a lot more meaty content related to the brain. After the midterm, there was not as much material - we basically rehashed old material, learned a bit more, and it seemed in general like we wasted more time during the second half. The class could be improved also by making the exams more in depth as they were basically very shallow questions, when we learned the concepts more in depth in class. The tests were meant to be easy, but it actually would have been easier had we been able to express more fully what we know instead of having a bunch of points put on a question that isn't as relevant. ",

            "\u00a0This was a great class. Professor Casey is a very caring teacher and the information is very interesting. I think the slides could be slightly more informative because they didn't have that much text on them so they were a little confusing to review. I also do not think we need to spend as much time reviewing information from previous classes, or three separate days of debate prep. I think it would have been better if we had broken into four teams for the debate because I think smaller teams would have been a lot more productive. ",

The material was understandable (though some background in neuroscience, like the Human Brain, is helpful for sure) and well-taught, and Prof. Casey was engaging and well-organized (class always let out by 10 am). There's a midterm, a final, and an in-class debate, but the exams are short and you are well-prepared for them, and you are given plenty of in-class time to prep for the debate, which can actually be fun if you let it be. Overall, great course! ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about why teenagers struggle with self-control and being emotionally impulsive. The class goes in-depth about how brain changes that are happening from ages 13-21 affect our actions, and as college students it's interesting that we can see ourselves in the studies somewhat (or at least have the experience of being a teenager in recent memory). \r\n\r\nThe content is never especially difficult, and Professor Casey really makes an effort to have everyone in the class understand what she teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's amazing ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, and I have, to people who are majoring in psychology, neuroscience, or education. I thought it was really interesting to learn about adolescence in terms of brain development, because it made the erratic behavior of teens much more grounded in fact and science, and explaining their behavior as being evolutionarily advantageous completely changed my perspective on things. But, I would also say that the class will be really hard for people who have not taken PSYC 160, The Human Brain. I took this class without having taken The Human Brain, and I had to make my neuroscience major friend explain several basic things to me before I was fully able to understand the topics we discussed in Adolescent Brain. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course had lots of interesting course content with applications in the legal and clinical fields. I also enjoyed the debate. ",
            "\u00a0If you need an easy A then I would definitely go for it. But honestly you really don't learn that much so if you're looking for something more intellectually fun you may want to re-think. ",
            "\u00a0Dont take this class if you want to actually learn something ",
            "\u00a0Not only is this a neuroscience class, this is a good class for anyone trying to understand the teenage brain and the legal ramifications with it. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would not recommend this course to another student unless they only wanted a laidback science credit. It started off well but later on was not very fulfilling because after the midterm, it seemed we lost a lot of the pace of what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0Great science credit for non-science majors, even if you havent taken the prerequisites. ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you took Human Brain, definitely take this class! Interesting class with reasonable workload and great teachers. ",

            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The course is approachable even for those without a background in neuroscience and the topic is widely applicable towards other domains. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a ton ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, its intectually stimulating but a gut workload wise ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great, very interesting class and it was not very difficult. The midterm and final were pretty straightforward and it is very clear what you need to study beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a great science credit! You don't need the prerequisites as you just learn the material presented (only a tiny bit of catch up re brain anatomy which you should do in the first weeks.) Important to attend lecture regularly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Without a background in neuroscience, the terms may seem complex at first, but you catch on quickly. Like learning a language, but easier. "
