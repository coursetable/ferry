I really liked that writing assignments in this class were more about the legacies of this history as opposed to the facts and figures themselves, because we could truly focus on applying historical lessons to present day themes.

Most of what he covers are events that were taught to you in high school AP classes; the Reagan administration, the AIDS crisis, civil rights movements, the Great Depression, etc., but he presents them through a different lens. He's trying to teach students to see the system behind singular events. It's a different mode of thinking, the kind of liberal arts education Yale brags about on its brochures. I enjoyed lectures and sections. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught 20th century American history, including the later parts that are skimmed over in many broader U.S. history courses, with a particular focus on understanding how each major period built toward our current political moment. It helped me learn how to identify the links in substance and tactics between social and political movements, and how to see an event both for its significance at the time and its historical significance in retrospect. It also taught me how to look carefully at cultural pieces as historical artifacts, understanding which broke new ground and how they reflect undercurrents not always visible in political history. ",

Think about this as more of a class where you are learning about the history of some early, mostly late and mid 1900s that led up to today ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the techniques and modes of analysis of cultural history  this class was really a cultural history of the 20th-21st centuries, and it taught me a lot of new perspectives and narratives about things that I knew/thought I knew. The main thing I learned was how to historicize things going on right now and especially how to analyze and critique cultural objects: things like tv shows, movies, advertisements, products  to see the political work that they do.

            "\u00a0how to think about the present through the historical context that shaped it. We learned to look at who we are and what our moment has become through the most recent history that created it. Learned to think critically about how different events work together through time periods and how events in the same time period work together and were shaped by previous time periods. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a solid trip through history. I did not have strong history instruction in high school, and so this class operated as a good overview of some of the major events and players from the 20th and 21st centuries. Focusing on specific movements and periods, the course also highlights cultural trends that proceeded and followed the specified dates. Overall, this class is a great introduction to recent American history, although it does skip over a lot due to time constraints. ",

What the class does do is analyze themes in US history and ties them back into present day (though it would have been more interesting if it related more to the present). There is a conscious effort to avoid talking about Trump's politics... but I was really hoping we would dive farther into what created the present dysfunction in government. The class handles particularly well post 9/11, post-second wave feminism, and post-deindustrialization. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various social and political movements and ideologies that emerged in recent history that created the foundation for our current moment, including the Civil Rights Movement, neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the gay rights movement, the 1965 Hart-Cellar Immigration Act, and the New Deal, among many others. I also gained insight into the importance of cultural and cultural productions in doing political work, or the \"work that culture does,\" and gained more knowledge and language to think more critically about the pop culture and media that we currently consume, what it means for marginalized communities, in particular communities of color, and how my own historicity provides a lens through which I view and interpret things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how we all carry a kind of historicity with us and how history impacts and plays a role in our lives today. The political, economic, and social atmosphere of today is a product of history and it is important to understand the historical context behind current events in order to move forward and affect change.

            "\u00a0Weakness - made you BUY a book every week and read 300+ pages. It was ridiculous how much reading there was when it was not even necessary for the tests. The teacher also was extremely politically skewed and projected his political beliefs into his teaching. He also taught in a disorganized way. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly engaging and relevant  it feels like not a week went by that at least one aspect of my everyday life reminded me of something we had covered in lecture (from tv episodes to news items to campus events). Lectures were always entertaining and informative, especially because of Professor Jacobson's incorporation of multimedia clips and unique frameworks through which to view history that many of us had already covered before in some form. I think the lectures and readings were a highlight of the course experience, and everything tied together very nicely. The workload was manageable and the exams were fair, even if they felt hard to prepare for beyond doing the readings and going to lecture. The readings were for the most part really interesting and refreshing in that they were not dryly covering the same tired subjects most American history majors have already studied (I especially liked the Traister, Coates, Dunbar-Ortiz, Mayer, and Bayoumi readings). Sections were also great, because there was always so much to talk about and I learned a lot from my classmates and TA, Megann (who is fabulous  consistently prepared, very responsive and fair, and really smart without coming across as pretentious). I really adored this class, and my only suggestion for improvement would be to broaden the ideological perspective a bit  it felt at times very much like an echo chamber, because Prof. Jacobson is obviously liberal as is the majority (if not entirely) of the class, and I think we all agreed with his take on most topics, but I personally would have liked him to incorporate (either each week or as a wrap up towards the end of the semester) a kind of \"History of Right Now for people who disagree with us\" and an application of these lessons to conservative perspectives. For example, how do conservatives view the Reagan Revolution and the New Deal? How could we apply what we covered in the Post-Second Wave unit in conversations with people who disavow feminism? I think part of why I loved this class so much was that it gave me new perspectives and evidence to back up many of my political beliefs, but it was always clear they were coming from someone with this particular point of view intended for a liberal leaning audience, and I would love to know how to translate these lessons into people from across the political spectrum in today's polarized world (especially where there is an increasing sense of history/liberal arts not mattering, which this class really disproves). ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is amazing. Professor Jacobson does two-part lessons going from most recent to further in the past. The readings are interesting but can be long and it would be better if we were given excerpts to focus on instead of whole books each week. The lectures were always interesting and there was so much to learn and take in, even if it's history you already knew about. ",
            "\u00a0The course lecture is amazing. Section is required but it did not feel totally necessary. The course has two short papers and a final exam but I think replacing the final exam with a longer final paper would better demonstrate knowledge of the course and allow students to explore in depth one of the topics we talked about. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jacobson is a fantastic professor and does an incredible job of providing a new lens to topics that some have and some have not learned about before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Jacobson is the best professor I've had at Yale. The books are really interesting and complementary, but the lectures themselves are amazing. While having both papers and exams objectively kind of sucks, the papers are really fun to do and the exams really let you play up the aspects of the course that you were most engaged in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm really at a loss to think of weaknesses; this is the best class I have ever taken. Section I guess could be slow sometimes, but that's section everywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Having tests feels really strange, especially with the papers -- I would rather have a narrower paper prompt and no tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an excellent job of teaching students how to think historically and consider the world around them as a product of history. The greatest weakness of this course was the reading- it was far too lengthy, and almost no students actually did it. If shorter readings were assigned, students would have been able to complete them rather than opting not to purchase books that they wouldn't have had time to read and doing no reading at all. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic, the information was really interesting, the reading load was just a little too heavy, so I think people ended up not reading parts that were actually important from some really good texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the professor and the information. I learned an incredible amount and really loved listening to what he had to say. Weaknesses - the class felt unstructured - studying based off of his lecture slides was largely impossible because his slides would post photos of TV shows or maps and have no information about it. After the first midterm I realized that I needed to know about small details like that so I took better notes in lecture, but in the first half of the semester I didn't know. Reading a book a week was a pain- and VERY expensive. Not all the books were even available at Yale Bookstore. But despite all of this - I still really loved this class which shows how interesting and great it is! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and thought that Jacobson's lectures were extremely engaging and insightful. While I loved all the books we read, I thought we could definitely benefit from having more time to talk about them instead of only in section, and maybe having less than one book per week. ",
            "\u00a0personal political beliefs of professor often bleed into \"factual\" lectures ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was definitely a strength. Professor Jacobson has a way of narrating events and trends that made the things I had taken for granted as normal seem completely bizarre. It was like a wake-up call. One weakness was that we really only heard a very liberal perspective on events -- while lectures were incredibly insightful, I think it would have been helpful to learn more narratives that Professor Jacobson disagreed with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: mind-bogglingly strong lectures that inspired me to reimagine the past century of United States history in fascinating ways, mostly excellent books assigned, going back in time rather than forward, emphasis on a unique style of thinking historically, and essays that had us historicize the present.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it ended.

            "\u00a0The material is very interesting, especially if you're interested in modern US history/politics. The readings are too long and could definitely be shortened to just a few assigned chapters/ pages rather than entire books. Lectures were very engaging, but they sometimes felt disorganized towards the second half of the semester because of falling behind schedule. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths are that the lectures were always engaging and that the powerpoint slides helped us visualize whatever was being discusses. Photographs, music, and video clips were an integral part of the course's success. A main weakness was that we were required to read a book per week and oftentimes this proved too difficult of an assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures are just about the most interesting thing I've ever experienced. I especially loved how much cultural history came to the forefront, as the class focused primarily on how history affects, protects, harms, helps (etc) people. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I couldn't keep up with the weekly readings (a book a week) because it was my fifth credit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course readings were enjoyable - if long - and the lectures were well-delivered with a lot of passion and preparation. Prof. Jacobson takes pride in his work and was very dedicated in planning the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the course seemed overly concerned with only historically excavating what was relevant to the present, and often exceptionalized today's \"right now.\" It also felt a little lacking in depth in nuance, more in the nature of a survey course, which was perhaps inevitable given the size of the course. Section, meanwhile, was often a drag, and not because of any lack of effort from the TA. With a book a week, readings were inevitably incomplete and section was often reduced to talking about the news. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredible professor and TF, engaging course material, exciting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0I thought that Professor Jacobson was very engaging and knowledgeable, and I appreciated the ways in which he encouraged students to analyze and historicize their present. I appreciated the cultural history components, but thought that they sometimes weren't as well-integrated into lectures as they could have been. I also think that the class could have been 50 minutes rather than 75 minutes long. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a general overview of American democracy history, and was interesting in that respect. However, lectures were very predictable and never really gave further or different insight beyond what you'd expect from a cursory knowledge of the subject and the general 'liberal' point of view. The assignments were reasonable, but the reading was really a lot -- one book per week. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It should be a requirement for all Yale students. Truly taught me how to cope with current events, understand the present from a larger historical viewpoint, and to find peace in these revelations. ",
            "\u00a0strength was that is was really interesting and Dr. Jacobson put a really unique perspective on historical events and their legacies. \r\nWeakness was that is was very unorganized and had to read a book a week when really probably could have gotten away with reading just excerpts of the book ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was really well thought out, and for the most part I enjoyed the book selection. I liked the essay assignments and doing the midterm/final, I thought the final was slightly too long. I also thought that some of the graphs/data were presented with too little context, and it made me skeptical of the argument being made. Single numbers are always dangerous, so I wanted to know more information to understand the trends! Also it would have been helpful to have other interpretations/counter-points to the main lectures would have made them stronger! Overall great attention to highlighting many different voices which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This course has many strengths, as I've outlined in my responses to the other questions, but its focus on engaging critically with multiple perspectives on historical events has been particularly important. It does this through presenting alternate narratives in lecture, through books that take a particular point of view, and through inviting lively debate in sections. The encouragement to attend and make connections with relevant film screenings and outside lectures was also great. The only weakness is that the readings can become quite long, and since they weren't central to participating and succeeding in the course, they often seemed to be skimmed or ignored by many students. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and necessary skills and knowledge taught in the class. There were a lot of little facts that were not necessary. For understanding but made the final and midterm unnecessarily harder. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures, reading list, structure of class, content, assignments. Weaknesses: incorporating the readings into lectures and especially into section  they were great, but we didn't take enough time to talk about them. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be more balanced. Professor Jacobson told us how this class is designed to teach us how to think but in reality this class taught us how he thinks. Every single book and lecture was very liberal. I am a liberal, a registered Democrat, and agree with most if not all of Professors views. But the fact that there was zero representation of the other side of ANY issue shows the pitfalls of our society. This class did not foster any sort of debate or conversation, and was simply Professor teaching us his views about current events and why they are correct, without acknowledging that there are other, legitimate sides to basically everything we talked about. That said, Professor Jacobson is a great lecturer and his lectures were very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of information which is great. The individual lectures flow very well because all of the history is intertwined within a theme of that lecture. However, the overall course does not flow well. It is extremely difficult to study for because it has a lot of overlapping information between themes. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was super strong overall. I think having a book or two less a semester would be helpful because it was clear many couldnt get to every one each week which made section discussion more difficult. Reading fewer books would also allow us to talk more about what we learned in class in section as well as attempt to assess events we dont discuss in class in a similar way to how we do in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course material is super interesting and incredibly relevant to students' participation in today's society. Prof Jacobson does a good job of teaching us about the periods that our previous history classes always skip, allowing us to think historically about the period that we are living in. Lectures are always engaging and the readings are too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course sometimes paints political debates as black and white (dems=good, reps=bad). Often, this conclusion comes implicitly and can lead students farther left whilst demonizing and failing to understand the logic, priorities and though processes that go into more conservative thinking. Conservatives can't always be wrong, or always be evil and democrats can't always be right or always be honest and well-intentioned. \r\nFurther, while all the readings are relevant and interesting, they can be too much. A book a week is not realistic. ",
            "\u00a0The intended course structure was very clear and thoughtful. However, often Professor Jacobson had SO much to say about each topic that it began to feel rushed at the end. In his effort to impart everything that he knows, I don't feel like I truly absorbed a lot of the material. Thus, slightly more focused topics or lectures would be a good thing if the class is taught in the future. Also, although all the books were very interesting and definitely texts I would love to read, an entire book a week for a lecture is not practical. Students will stop doing the readings if it is more than around 50 pages a week for a lecture. They won't read not because they don't want to but because we simply don't have the time with three or four other classes and everything else that we have going on. Therefore, I recommend highlighting important chapters from the books so that students feel like the reading is more manageable and will be more likely to complete it. ",
            "\u00a0The primary weakness of this course was that it in large part lacked historical objectivity. Even as a liberal student, I was frustrated at times when the information presented was not a record of events, but rather a far-left commentary on events and their impact. I'm not entirely sure what I learned in the class, since the majority of what was taught was opinion and political talking points. ",
            "\u00a0THIS COURSE WAS MY FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE - THANK YOU PROFESSOR JACOBSON ",
            "\u00a0It was incredibly relevant to todays world and I loved every lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a dedicated professor, thought-provoking lectures, interesting subject matter.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred 50-minute lectures. Also it would have been better to keep the structure suggested at the beginning of the term where the first lecture of the week is background information and the second is a more critical analysis-- each issue veered too much to one side or the other. The reading list is entirely too long. Since it feels unmanageable, it leads students to not even attempt the reading. If selections were chosen from the books, students would be much more likely to do some of the reading. This is among the reasons that discussion section was not good. Also, my teaching assistant was new to teaching and unfortunately that meant she was more worried about us liking her than she was about pushing us to speak critically or ask tough questions. Hopefully the other sections were better, but ours was a waste of time in which we often just watched media clips. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jacobson is an incredible lecturer. I thought that the course provided a really great overview of recent history and provided students with the tools and knowledge of history to think critically about the current moment. Throughout the course, I found myself thinking more deeply about the media and pop culture that I encountered in the everyday. I also really appreciated how Professor Jacobson informed us about relevant lectures on campus and in New Haven -- I went to one of these speaker events with Jill Lepore, and as someone interested in information and data, found it extremely fascinating and meaningful! However, the course moves very quickly and tries to cover a lot of material, which can be beneficial in providing an overview of the historical trends in a given time period, but I oftentimes felt like breadth was emphasized at the expense of depth. I wish the course had more historical meat in discussing specific dates, events, and policies, and it sometimes felt like we were only getting a minute smattering of the sentiments and statistics in an era with no clear idea of what we were missing in what was _not_ being mentioned. I also felt like the workload of having to read a book the same week in which one of the two papers was due could be overwhelming and oftentimes meant that students would forgo reading the book, but would still have to purchase it for the sake of bringing it to section, in lieu of writing the paper. Additionally, though the first half of the course (prior to spring break) was relatively well organized, I thought the second half of the course was less well-organized in terms of breaking up each lecture into distinct sections or themes. ",
            "\u00a0-readings were long (a book a week is a lot)\r\n-excellent professor\r\n-enjoyed writing the papers (got a lot of freedom to write about what we were really interested in)\r\n-engaged current events with the class, intertwined news and our own personal experiences with what we were learning\r\n-lectures sometimes went too fast, lecture slides mostly just had pictures so it sometimes made it hard to follow but the images/audio/video were helpful learning aids ",

I do think people will get more out of the course if they have taken US history courses in the past, because a foundation of basic 20th century history is helpful and also highlights the ways in which this class approaches it differently in order to tie it into \"right now.\" You will learn how to think critically and historically about the present by examining some of the most important people, events, themes, trends, and changes of the past, and you will have a ton of fun while doing so  the lectures are so enthralling, Professor Jacobson is a star in the field and really wants students to get the most out of the semester, sections are always a blast and the readings are handpicked to be relevant/manageable/interesting. It's not an overwhelming amount of work and the assessments test what you've learned while emphasizing your personal experiences and without requiring rote memorization. It would make for a good 5th class or credit/d, a fresh perspective on history for an upperclassman history major, and a great class for a senior who wants to learn something they can apply in their real world conversations, pleasure reading and news consumption.

The lectures were overviews, as was expected, but at section, for example, we spent little time actually getting deeper into historical themes. The course framed its historical moment a little too uni-dimensionally, while the \"historical method\" espoused didn't offer any new insights.

This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale, and it provides a great opportunity to learn and think about the most important issues of our time, particularly for anyone who hasn't yet taken a course on late 20th-century American history. The course got me to think in new ways about the relationship between culture and politics, and how collective memory distorts the complexities of the past (and even the present). Lectures were great, readings were interesting and often offered a particular focus or perspective different from the one presented in lecture, and sections prompted excellent discussions.

I'd call it \"Cultural History of the 20th21st Centuries\" because that's really what it is: you go reverse chronologically from the present to the New Deal, mostly from the perspective of cultural history. Professor Jacobson is really great  he's extremely insightful and always manages to surprise you or make you think about something in new ways. I'm not sure how many people did the reading, but as someone who did, the books were mostly really good and fascinating; the syllabus is great. I think it's one of those classes that will stick with you in a lot of small ways. ",

The lectures are interesting and very practical to our everyday society, so you wont want to miss those. Essays are graded tough but interesting topics. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, and would recommend it. That said, it is very one-sided and liberal and void of any debate, so if thats your style, its the class for you. ",
