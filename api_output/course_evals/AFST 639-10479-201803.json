            "\u00a0I got better at reading French authors, seeing past their contrarian aesthetic to give credit to the substantive points they were making. The Mamdani reading was particularly striking in helping inform my understanding of early colonialism, which will be invaluable to me going forward. My final paper also allowed me to make use of some new analytical tools, which was highly rewarding and is an approach I look forward to integrating in future research. "

            "\u00a0The course is an excellent overview of African anthropology. The readings were all thought-provoking and usually caused substantive, lively class discussion. The art analysis was a particularly creative assignment. The weekly responses were a straightforward and effective way to ensure people engaged with the readings. \r\n\r\nThe title of this course should just be changed to African Anthropology. Calling it Africa, Anthropology and Politics seems extraneous given anthropology is already inherently political. The readings and subsequent discussions did not always closely match the politically-oriented description in the syllabus. In this course, we will further probe the question of how politics on the African continent work, and, by extension, their contributions to political theory and practice more broadly. We reviewed very little of these themes. The course is organized around some of the central problems of political theory, such as such as statelessness, the limits of the state, the role of religion in political life, nations and belonging, and space and power, and explores how these problems have played out on the continent. This class touched upon these themes, but not heavily.\r\n\r\nGoing into the class I had hoped to read some literature on what the state meant to Africans  what role it was considered to play historically and now, how accountability worked, their understanding of law, diplomacy and international relations. What there was of these themes was very engaging and enjoyable but I would have liked to have seen more. \r\n\r\nThe readings were enjoyable. That does not mean they were all good. The Besteman book and Ferguson's \"Give a Man a Fish\" were particularly heinous; Besteman blatantly pushes an agenda between the lines and Ferguson brings nothing to the table. These readings should definitely be replaced in the class' next incarnation.\r\n\r\nProf. Lombards own work is a very engaging brand of political anthropology. Were she to include more readings of that nature, the class would have better deserved its moniker. Her comments on Central African Republic never failed to pique my interest. I also would have been very interested to hear her expand upon the shortcomings she observed in DDR programs. "

            "\u00a0The course would be excellent for a student who is curious to expand their knowledge of African anthropology in a closely-controlled environment. "
