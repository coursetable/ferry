            "\u00a0Over the course of English 114, my writing was greatly strengthened. I learned to become more careful with how I described existing scholarly discourse, and my own claims and organization became stronger as the course progressed. From the first essay to the third, I felt that I made visible improvements. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to dissect scholarly texts to find the main points of an argument and its structure as well as how to craft research arguments of my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better read through college-level writings and how to effectively develop arguments in a college-level paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to structure and approach academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Better writing ability and especially improvement at creating a real research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to identify the basic elements of a academic paper (e.g. Problem, Claim, etc.). This allowed me to better speed read and quickly identify the key ideas in a paper. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I learned to take advantage of Yale's writing resources such as the CTL's Writing Partner program, and Residential College Writing Tutors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to communicate my ideas effectively on paper. I learned how to substantiate these ideas with valid arguments that allowed my writing to be clear and concise. "

            "\u00a0The essays that were assigned in the course did a great job of encompassing the types of writing that are prevalent at the college level. By framing the class assignments within certain structures, the organization and framework of my writing was strengthened. Some of the readings, however, were somewhat dry and uncompelling. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved with more enthusiastic and less robotic teaching. More productive use of time would be helpful in improving the classroom experience. The peer review sessions were a highlight of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course content itself was interesting enough and it's useful in teaching students how to read dense scholarly texts early on. The classes in my particular section were not helpful most of the time and were a waste of an hour in the day. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching style of the professor falls flat sometimes with the class in that it does not engage even when the material of the course is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths; small size, interesting readings and assignments ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the most part were not that relevant or engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good at introducing a new student to the expectations of college-level writing. However, I feel like the instructor was poorly prepared to teach a course by herself. She engaged with the course much like a TA rather than a confident and clear teacher. Class time was often times wasted on teaching college students how to do basic things such as writing a bibliography or MLA citation via reading text off a PowerPoint slide. While these nuts and bolts of writing are important, I feel that they should only be a small component of a two-hour seminar and not be the primary focus. I would much rather learn about the complexities and nuances of academic writing. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improving the course, I feel that the instructor should undergo more pedagogical training and design the class syllabus less rigidly (e.g. the instruction sheets designed for each writing workshop is a case in point). Notably, I feel that the first paper (e.g. Hand and Sandywell) was unnecessarily confusing and an ineffective way of introducing the students to academic writing. The expectations for the first paper were not as effectively communicated as the second and third paper which I actually enjoyed writing after receiving help from the CTL and residential college writing tutors because office hours led by the instructor were--for the lack of a better term--awkward. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in teaching me how to write a research paper. It was not a very conducive class to facilitate group discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to incoming students. While I felt fairly confident that I could write at a college level upon entering the class, English 114 refined my work. For those who have little experience writing at a higher level, the course will be an encompassing introduction. For those who believe that their work is on the level that it should be, this course will build upon what they already know. ",
            "\u00a0No. Emily makes the writing process unnecessarily frustrating. I appreciate and welcome a challenge, but when she constantly deflects questions and offers little feedback outside the criticism of your ideas, a challenge turns into a headache. The things that she will criticize your essay for are the same things she praises in the class readings she offers. Refused to provide example essays when asked. ",
            "\u00a0The course, yes. This particular section, no. The idea of the course is great in theory but in practice, the section I was in was not that helpful in improving from paper to paper other than a lot of drafts with confusing and unclear feedback from the instructor. Most improvement was made from going to the CTL writing tutors and having them help with the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. If you are interested in the material and can get along with most professors' teaching style than go for it but if the teaching style will make or break your interests in the class I suggest maybe look elsewhere first. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Mrs. Glider may be an intelligent English graduate student but she was poorly prepared to teach a group of college students academic writing. While I feel like part of the reason is her own fault, I feel that Yale's English Department should have better vetted their instructors or at least have their graduate students serve as TFs to exemplar professors before being responsible for a class of their own. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless the level of instruction is improved. "
