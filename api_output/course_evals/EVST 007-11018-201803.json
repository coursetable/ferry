            "\u00a0This course really changed how I look at the natural world. Being able to see more of the history of the land just by looking at the elements present now is a really cool skill to have. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various natural landscapes of Connecticut. This class changed my knowledge of how we socially construct ideas of nature and the natural world. The class helped to improve my observational and plant ID skills as well as my understanding of the necessity of nature and natural history. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to develop my understanding of the natural world, both in New England and more generally. This class forced me to think about how the natural world is connected to a greater past, and how humans have affected the world around us. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify different plant species and how to more carefully observe the natural world around me. I learned to think more critically about environmental issues, land use history, and subjectivity in science. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the latin and common names of many native trees and how to identify them in person (as well as a few kinds of rock and soil), I learned to \"read\" the land use history of a landscape based on indicators like certain species or stone walls, and I learned much, much more about everything from New Haven trees today to Native American history in Connecticut from a great range of guest lecturers. No one class or field trip was exactly the same, so every week we delved into new material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify a lot of trees, plants, and general types of rock using field traits. I learned a good deal about soil quality and its relationship with different plant species. I learned how to survey a piece of land to construct a rough summary of its history (how it had been used in the past). I learned a good deal about the geological history of Connecticut. I also learned a little about Native American land use, urban forestry, hydrology, and geomorphology. Thanks to this course, when I go into the woods now, I definitely think more about the uniqueness of each different species I see, the chemical properties of the soil beneath my feet, and the story of the land around me. I appreciate nature even more now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about trees! This was my first exposure to dendrology and I've been able to notice subtle differences between barks, leaves, and habitats. I don't think I have gained an exceptional amount of dendrology knowledge, but I've gained the skill set of knowing where to look and what to look for in order to differentiate species. From the process, my curiosity to explore nature has been ignited. I've always appreciated the outdoors but now I know how to appreciate the millennia of geologic history, the influence of humans on the landscape, and the evolution of the habitat in addition to the natural splendor. Although in the long term I don't think I will be able to retain all my knowledge on trees, the way I view a landscape will definitely be different. I have learned how to question the stagnant state of a landscape that it appears to be. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep respect for natural history and the value of simply observing nature. I developed my observation, classification and analytical skills when taking in the nature around me and putting what I saw on paper. I am also happy with the plant classification skills I learned by taking this course as it opened my eyes to what exists in nature whether in the forest or on urban green spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to identify various types of trees that grow in New England and know what different trees mean about the soil and land use. I have never been around CT before so it was very interesting to see different habitats and places around the state. We studied many types of forests including urban, coastal, wetland, and trap rock ridge forests. Thinking about forests in different time scales from 100,000 years to 100 years was very eye opening for me and realizing how much of a state of flux that all forests are in, especially with new extreme weather patterns due to climate change. ",
            "\u00a0I gained much greater knowledge of the forest in New England about trees, soil, land use, and other ecological factors. I gained the skills of being able to identify tree species by looking at them, and being able to identify the land use history of parts of the forest. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: getting to be out in nature every week both for class and then for our journal entries, opportunities to get outside of Yale and refresh my perspective, getting to meet really cool professors and people in the field, taking advantage of Yale's resources. Weaknesses: the assignments can be time consuming if you take them seriously, while it is also a strength going out into the field can be inconvenient to work around especially at the beginning, each class was really long so sometimes it was hard to be focused and engaged for such a long period of time ",
            "\u00a0It is an amazing course. The emphasis on field work and outdoor education engages all students. I loved the diversity of spaces and topics that we covered, it provided a great foundation for understanding natural history generally. I really enjoyed journaling each week, it helped to develop my observational skills and get me outside. It's also an amazing class to be a first-year seminar, you get to spend long periods of time with other first year students predominantly off-campus and therefore get to know them well. It's an important course as it reinforces the benefits of being in nature.\r\n\r\nI wish we focused more on natural history theories and ecology systems at the beginning of the semester to ground our understanding going forwards. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of this course is exceptional. Going to different sites every week is a perfect way for first-years to get oriented with New England and to better understand its ecology. Talking to different speakers was also fascinating, and showed me the different ways that you can be employed or can engage in this field. The assignment of going to \"my spot\" every week was also great because it was a great way to learn the course material, but is also a good way to destress and orient myself in New Haven. The only improvement I can think of is that the first few lessons were very heavy on plant identification, which made it difficult to keep up at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: getting to see a lot of places outside campus, getting to be outside, feeling more comfortable/knowledgeable about the natural world. \r\nWeaknesses: none. ",
            "\u00a0Getting to learn the material by going on field trips and being outdoors was the best part of the class--it was very hands-on. The overnight field trip was also a great experience--though I admit was a bit reluctant going in, it was a fantastic weekend which helped my understanding of the material a lot and which helped our class become closer. Plus, Marlyse is a great teacher who cares a lot about her students and who wanted to help us learn about whatever we wanted to know more about. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I would say that the dendrology-heavy classes could feel like they went on for a very long time, and it was hard to remember each species (especially for the ID quiz the next class) when we had to take them in all at once. If there's any way that information could be more spaced out, that might be helpful. Also, the different land use terms and definitions (poor pasture, old field, young forest, etc) could be a bit confusing, and to really nail the understanding of those in early on in the semester would be helpful for the rest of the semester and for the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course for first-years because it's fairly laid-back and easy, and it gives the students an opportunity to dip their feet into environmental studies and ecology and evolutionary biology. I really did learn a lot. I like that it only meets once a week and that every meeting is a long field trip. The fact that we were never really learning in a traditional classroom setting kept me really engaged and interested, as did the wide range of the topics we examined. The overnight trip was a great time. So was the midterm! The flexibility of the final project was also very liberating. Even though it was not worth a lot of our grade, it really got me to be creative and spend a lot of time outdoors observing nature. If anything, I would want this course to be made a little more challenging. I would also want more opportunities to engage with the professor one-on-one during class. ",
            "\u00a0Just the fact that our excursions were only a 30-ish minute drive away from campus demonstrated how little environmental changes within a small area could have such a profound effect on the natural landscape. The class was very immersive and I enjoyed its field-based nature. I could actually visualize and concretize concepts and ideas in front of me. As a kinesthetic learner, I found being able to see and touch the plants as we were learning solidified my learnings a lot. Particularly the Yale-Myers Forest trip was very rewarding. I think I learned the most that weekend. The isolation from everyday campus and the beautiful area really helped cement the knowledge into my mind. \r\n\r\nAs a field-based class, there was difficulty for the entire class to be engaged at all times. Sometimes if I were at the back of the line, I couldn't hear properly. Perhaps it would be better to limit the class size smaller? I feel that it would make the individual experience more rewarding but that would also exclude students from participating. Some people came into the class already with considerable knowledge on trees/ecology and I wasn't one of them. Sometimes I felt that I could not keep up because of that. For example, there were terms that were repeated consistently that I was not familiar with, and it took me a while to understand their meaning. An introductory lesson where recurring terms/concepts/themes were explained could have been useful. I also did most of the readings for the class but I found that they didn't bear much relevance to the class content. Perhaps it was because of my own unfamiliarity with the New England area and my inability to link the concepts. Some readings like the Bell referenced many areas and key features of New England and Connecticut which were quite abstract to me, so I could not tie them into our field classes. I would appreciate a quick sum-up or discussion on the readings before the beginning of class to draw out the key concepts or themes that we were supposed to glean from the reading, and how that tied into the field. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the power point presentations, and although I enjoyed the hands-on and field-based essence of the class, more presentations or discussions in the future would help enrich our conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that the course was field based was one of its biggest strengths. Going to a new place every time kept me on my toes and interested in everything that was being said and around me. I wish I had kept up with the readings more. There is not much pressure in the class to do the readings as it is not tested on. But I do like that depending on your interest level you can adjust the level of engagement with the course and still have a very fulfilling experience at the minimum. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really really strong. I enjoyed every class we had and I felt like I learned about the forest on a new level every time we met. I think one weakness is that the class is such a big block of time and so is hard for some people to schedule, but honestly it was worth it just to be able to go on so many incredible trips and be able to dedicate a time to be in nature each week. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to people that really enjoy being outdoors and also people that enjoy alternative classroom settings. The lectures were interesting and being outside is always refreshing. It is slightly more taxonomically focused than I expected, especially at the beginning. It is also definitely a class you have to be committed to because field trips were time intensive as were the weekly journals (not something you could procrastinate or work around like other subjects). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's an amazing course that all first-year students should take regardless of specific academic interests. It is unique in its field based approach. We (students in the class) all agreed that it was vital space in maintaining our physical and mental wellbeing throughout the semester as otherwise we would not have spent such extensive time outdoors and away from technology. It is also a great introductory to any people interested in natural science. The focus of the course is on process and development rather than testing; this allows students to feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is not only a great class but also a great way to be exposed to New Haven and its surrounding areas. The constant changing of locations and speakers means that this class has so much to offer. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. It is super rewarding due to the concrete knowledge and changes in perspective you gain. Marlyse is an incredibly knowledgeable and kind teacher, someone from whom it is an immense privilege to learn. This class is an amazing addition to any courseload, whether or not the rest of the courses youre taking are stem-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would! Even if you are not a science person or an environmental studies major, you will get so much out of the class, and it will be different from any other class you'll take at Yale. The chance to get to see a new place in nature with a great teacher every week and to get off campus was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend it. Marlyse is an amazing professor with a lot of personality--she's super passionate and inspirational and has an awesome life story. This course is definitely a good opener course if you're thinking about majoring in EVST or E&EB, but it's also just a fun course to take if you want to be able to identify plants or other aspects of nature when you're hiking. Marlyse told us the goal of this class was to change the way we saw the world around us, and it definitely did that for me. Whenever I go into the woods now, I'm constantly thinking about the uniqueness of each different species I see, the chemical properties of the soil beneath my feet, and the story of the land around me. Also, this course felt very freeing; it's a great way to get outdoors and explore the area around New Haven. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Not only is it so amazing to have a weekly break away from the Yale campus, it will completely transform the way you view nature. You get what you give into the class. Effort and interest are crucial to doing well and just for the full transformative experience to take effect. I would only recommend those who have a genuine interest to take the class, and not those seeking an easy/fun credit. I think taking the class among a busy, highly intensive schedule would be ideal because the class is such a refreshing experience when you stay in a natural area for 4 hours on a Thursday afternoon. In addition to the weekly PITW visits, the space will really help clear your head and refocus your energy that will benefit your performance in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The aspect of being outdoors made my first semester at Yale so much better as I had a few hours every week to connect with nature and see the natural beauty of the place I will call home for the next 4 years. I was introduced to so many concepts and aspects of natural history and it definitely sparked an interest that I will pursue in some capacity during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely. Just being able to get out of the Yale Bubble every week was very refreshing and journaling weekly was almost meditative. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course! Not only is each lesson fun and engaging, but I have found myself much more interested in environmental studies than I ever would have thought I'd be before taking this class. The field trips are so much fun and in the end I've found that I really do view nature in a different way after taking this class. All students should take this opportunity to surround themselves with nature each week. "
