            "\u00a0In this course we learned grammar, time, numbers, activities, dialogues, food, parts of the body, methods of travel, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an introduction to speaking, understanding, reading and writing Swahili. The oral engagement in the class really helped me get a feel for what \"sounds right,\" which contributes to conversational fluency. ",
            "\u00a0I learned important, fundamental vocabulary, the basics of the language and cultural insights.\r\n\r\nI developed the skill of independent studying to build knowledge of a language. ",
            "\u00a0Kiswahili 110 taught me how to engage with a language in a clear and practical manner.  From the first week of class, we were speaking in complete sentences, engaging in a typical greeting.  The class opened the door for me to invest deeply in Swahili, even providing the etymylogical construction of swahili verbs in conjugation. ",
            "\u00a0Intro to Swahili is such an amazing class. I can now (I think) fare well in Dar es Salaam. It may sound wild, but I can actually speak some Swahili! "

            "\u00a0This course very effectively made me comfortable as a beginner in Swahili. ",
            "\u00a0Diverse class. Many international students. Students come from all kinds of backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that I felt confident in my Swahili by the end of the semester. The course paced our learning of the language in the right way that I could end the semester in this way.\r\n\r\nStyles of learning were fun and varied enough to keep the 5-times-a-week classes fresh.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was a lack of correction and focus on accent and pronunciation. Also, lack of clarity on attendance and whether classes could be missed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1. Every day we warm up with some greetings that get us into the practice of speaking Swahili daily. \r\n2.  Homework is challenging but do-able\r\n3. Quizzes and tests are very fair. \r\n4. Lessons are clear, and Kiarie is always encouraging of questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1.  It can be difficult to demonstrate engagement in the class when asked to perform, at-times nerve-wracking skits and presentations.  \r\n2. Sometimes I wish there would be seating randomization to have the ability to converse with new people; it was easy to fall into comfortable habits talking to the same partner every day. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in East Africa. ",
            "\u00a0This is my favorite class I've ever taken at Yale. Swahili is an amazing language and an amazing class. The teaching is superb, and the language is easy and fun to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because it is an important, interesting and challenging language, well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend Kiswahili as a course to Yale students.  I came in taking it having already fulfilled a language requirement, and I can honestly say that most if not all students were engaged and interested in learning the language.  It's a very logical language with a beautiful sound, and an important non-western language to learn.  The teacher, Kiarie, and our TA, Getruda were both humorous and compassionate educators invested in the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. Swahili is a very useful and fun language to learn. Not only is it the main language spoken across East Africa, but also it is a great case of a creole language, with distinct traces of Arabic and Bantu languages. "
