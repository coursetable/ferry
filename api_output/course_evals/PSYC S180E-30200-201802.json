            "\u00a0Formulating discussion questions when I didn't necessarily have anything forced me to dig deeper into the material, which I really appreciated. Note taking was something I wasn't great in before, but watching the lectures constantly was important and I improved in that. As for the specific material, I learned to think about these phenomenons under a variety of different lenses, meaning culturally, socially, psychologically, and biologically. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the etiology, symptoms, and treatment courses for several mental disorders as classified by the DSM-5, including eating disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, OCD and PTSD. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton of information about mental illness and treatment for mental illnesses. Out of all the classes I have taken at Yale, I feel like this is the most relevant class for every single student to take. So many of the topics discussed in the class are heard of but completely misunderstood. This class really helped me understand these issues much better. ",
            "\u00a0Debunked myths on mental illnesses by learning about the etiology of some of the main mental disorders. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a wide breadth of psychological and psychiatric disorders, including their symptomology, treatment, and causal theory. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The discussion sections were very insightful and made the class seem more personable, however I believe that the amount of material was too much to be sufficiently comprehended in the time allotted for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great for an online course. Obviously there was just an insane amount of material to cover over the five weeks and I was working a 9-5 job at the same time which often made it difficult to keep up. The discussion sections were pretty engaging, though I wish there had been more of a structure to it and we had a bit more guidance as well. ",
            "\u00a0The recorded lectures were easy to follow. Discussion section sparked good conversations. One way the course could be improved would be if the major topics of/takeways from the lectures were reviewed before the discussion was started ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the professor and her wonderful and engaging lectures. I don't really have any recommendations for improvement for the course. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors were good. The course content was slightly heavy because of the short duration of 5 weeks, but the exam questions were reasonably easy. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of covering a huge amount of information in a way that is easily digestible and makes it possible to retain the majority of the material covered. I only wish we had more time and could have covered a bit more. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend that a person take this course during the academic year so that they have more time to process the knowledge and study the material.  I loved the content that was learned however I did not like the fashion and time slot that I had to learn it in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Joorman is so nice and so engaging and being able to talk with her in discussion sections was a fantastic opportunity, especially because she was so open to questions and you can see how much she cares about the material. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because of how intense the workload is if you are doing other things during the summer, such as a 9-5 job. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class is a fairly simple class if you put in the time and effort. Tests were very fair and graded easily. Put in the work to watch the lectures/read the textbook and you'll do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, please take this course! Not only does it not require a ton of work or anything super stressful, but the class is amazing and super interesting. You will not regret taking this course no matter what. Definitely study hard for the exams because the questions are more specific than you might initially anticipate, but overall it is not super difficult to do well in the course. The professor is amazing, and everyone should have the chance to meet her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. I really love the way Prof. Joormann taught the course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is well organised to make the material easy to understand and remember. The professor is an excellent lecturer (clear and engaging), and the material is very interesting and applicable to everyday life. "
