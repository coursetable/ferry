            "\u00a0This was an incredible class! This course gave me an entirely new framework for thinking about visual culture, the American identity, and national park systems. Professor Bravo was engaging with her students and an exceptional teacher. ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly changed the way I think about the national parks, and how they inform and reflect American identity--which they do, more than I could have thought possible. It also opened my eyes to the idea of \"visual culture\", which is all around us and constantly informing the way we move through the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course's scope was fairly flexible, covering a broad range of topics under the umbrella intersection of the outdoors and nature, American history and culture, and art and photography. Got me to think critically about how visual culture has shaped my perceptions of the natural world and American West, while becoming more comfortable with interpreting art and making cultural criticisms. ",
            "\u00a0I developed critical viewing, thinking, and writing skills as well as a greater knowledge of artwork related to the national parks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about art history, as it was my first art history course, as well as the history of our national parks in general. ",
            "\u00a0In Visual Culture of the National Parks, we cover the history of America's nature from the mid-19th century to present. The course is certainly more of an art history course than a straight history of the parkswe spend more time looking at prints, painting, posters, and photography of the parks than we do learning when specific parks opened or anything like that. The readings are strong, and visual culture is a clever way to approach studying the visual-centric national parks. I developed a much better understanding of the creations (and problems) with the national parks, the theory of how we define \"wilderness\" and \"nature,\" and of different approaches to depicting them over the past century and a half. You also learn how to curate an \"online exhibition,\" which is somewhat different from writing a paper. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the national parks and how they are and have been represented visually over time; how our perception of what the national parks are and what they mean has been shaped (and often created) by visual culture; learned a lot about the food culture of the national parks via my final project; learned about relevant art movements and artists. ",
            "\u00a0Relations between art objects, land, governmental agencies, race relations, ideas of wilderness, historical understandings of land etc ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the history of the National Parks, their importance within the culture of the United States and American painting and photography, and how to analyze and write about artwork that represents American nature and the National Parks. "

            "\u00a0strengths - professor bravo is really engaging and made sure that we had lots of field trips to various museums and institutions of visual culture. it was also refreshing that she taught with a certain amount of distance from the speakers she invited and sources she chose.\r\n\r\nweaknesses - the thematic arrangement of the course was a little confusing, moving from historical to geographical to theoretical themes. also there was slightly too much reading per week. ",
            "\u00a0The course included a ton of trips to the YUAG and the Beinecke to take advantage of Yale's resources. This was definitely a highlight of the course, and really strengthened our discussions and my understanding of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely loved this course. Monica was a fantastic professor, led a great discussion, and designed a very compelling and interesting curriculum. This class made strong use of Yale's many resources, like the YUAG and Peabody, and the course benefitted from these additions. Engaging assignments and readings, fair grading, reasonable workload, and good feedback. I also really got a lot out of the final project. Overall one of my favorite classes this year! ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class, with its reading responses, was great. ",
            "\u00a0The gallery/museum/Beinecke visits were all excellentI really appreciated that Prof. Bravo set up all of those meetings because the engagement with primary sources was invaluable to getting a good understanding of the works being discussed in the readings. I thought a few of the readings got a bit mired in theory for my tastes, but overall the reading selection was very good. I especially enjoyed the class section on Manzanar. I also liked the way Prof. Bravo broke up our seminar sessions with a mixture of PowerPoints, small group activities, and large group discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Bravo, class field trips and material, class discussions, final project, diverse group of people taking the course - basically everything about this class was amazing. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings were too much to get through, although we didn't usually talk through a lot of them in class so that wasn't a super big deal. Would have done more of the readings if there were less to do though. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating interdisciplinary subject! One of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. A really exciting, multi-faceted approach to looking at images and art historical objects ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bravo did a great job of incorporating many different points of view (historical, artistic, environmental) to create a cohesive and inclusive narrative of the National Parks within American visual culture. Even without art history experience, I felt comfortable sharing my opinions and reactions to art, and I learned how to better express these through the example that Professor Bravo set. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a great way to think not only about the visual culture of the National Parks, but also about landscape and politics of land in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had an amazing experience and learned a ton. Plus Monica is the fucking best!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This course, and Professor Bravo, were simply amazing. Great discussions about important issues, but from a super unique and unexpected angle with surprising depth to it. One of my favorite classes ever at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would love to recommend this course, but as it stands Monica has taken another position -- Yale's loss, but big congratulations to her. I really loved this class and will definitely take a lot of it with me moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you're interested in a critical examination of the National Parks as a facet of American identity through Art History, ",
            "\u00a0Yes, incredibly interesting to hear about these issues from a diverse set of viewpoints, as the students were often EVST, art history, and even STEM. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend Visual Culture of the National Parks! I went in hoping that it would have a historical focus, but ended up really enjoying the art historical approach to learning about the parks. Be prepared to have classmates engage in a lot of (sometimes overbearing) revisionism/cynicism, but Prof. Bravo does a great job managing discussion and is very approachable/helpful. The visits to the YUAG, Beinecke, and Peabody are the highlight of the course and let you see originals of much of the material we discuss in class. Manageable workload and attracts students from a range of majors, which I liked. ",
            "\u00a0I wish Professor Bravo wasn't leaving this year because this has been one of my all-time favorite classes at Yale!! As a non-art person, I was nervous about taking the class but it was one of the most accessible and continuously interesting classes I've taken. The class discussions, especially during field trips, were fantastic, and Prof Bravo is just an amazing teacher - perhaps the best professor I've had at Yale. The workload is very manageable and the final project was actually really fun to do. HIGHLY recommend. I loved how this class brought together people from so many different backgrounds - the group really made the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! One of the most exciting, nuanced, intersting classes I have taken. I learned a lot from being in a class with students from a variety of majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class because of how it integrates so many different tactics of analysis with relation to the National Parks, wilderness, and art. It was amazing to take advantage of the resources we have by frequently having the class in the Art Gallery or other museums around campus, and it felt really special to be able to learn how to collect and write about art while contributing to an actual website that can be enjoyed by the public!
