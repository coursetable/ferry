            "\u00a0great intro to photolitho, bookmaking and more ambitious screenprinting projects! ",
            "\u00a0This class is an interdisciplinary printmaking class. We covered lithography and screenprinting techniques, as well as risograph and digital printing briefly. These projects also involved book design/binding and sculpture. "

            "\u00a0Really great course, no obvious weaknesses at all. Only suggestion is it could be fun to have a lesson one day on how to use the flat bed printer in the ccam. ",
            "\u00a0wish we he had more time in the studio. ",
            "\u00a0Alex is a great professor, the course was really focused on allowing each student to explore their own interests. The skills we learnt helped to generate an array of approaches to these individual explorations. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very fun and consisted mostly of studio time. I do wish there was a slightly tighter schedule. There could have been time for an additional smaller project. Also, the critiques took too long; they could have been timed better. "

            "\u00a0Yes - I loved this class! As a non art major it was an awesome chance to learn new skills and Alex is a really wonderful teacher who always makes time to meet with you and offer advice - you get exposure to a bunch of techniques (screen printing, some 3D sculpture work, risograph printing, litho ink, book binding, etc). ",
            "\u00a0this is a really great class, and alex rules. you definitely get out of it what you put into itand if youre willing to put in a lot of extra work outside of class time, you can do an incredible amount. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really fun! As a graphic design concentration, I really enjoyed learning about printmaking. Even though this class is labeled as Printmaking 2, most of my classmates had no prior printmaking experience. Additionally, since it is interdisciplinary, there are opportunities to bring in your own interests. "
