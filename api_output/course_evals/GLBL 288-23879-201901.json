            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the relationship between the state and the military. I never considered a lot of the implications we discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about research and how to analyze civil-military relations in an academic framework. ",
            "\u00a0A great class to 1. Learn about basic CMR theory 2. Examine international case studies of democratization and CMR 3. Plan and write a Poly Sci analysis paper ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this class I had no idea what civil-military relations are, so learning about this concept gave me a new framework through which to analyze politics and state formation. The term paper we wrote also taught me a lot about the research process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various civil military relations theories while also applying that knowledge to case studies from around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the relationships between the military and civilian government ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about civil-military relations, as I had never heard of the field and didn't know what it was at all. This was also one of the first global affairs courses I took, so it taught me a lot about how research works in the field and how to write about qualitative research. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a working familiarity with the contours of the CMR field described by classic theories, contemporary ripostes and extant challenges/gaps.\r\n\r\nI re-discovered the faculties of deep academic reading and analysis that I had allowed to atrophy, and was able to hone them through the prescribed regimen of weekly memos and the final research paper.\r\n\r\nI came away from the course with a deeper appreciation of the fundamental fault line that underlies so many societies and a glimpse of the ingredients that go into the sausage making of policy.

            "\u00a0I think the material is awesome! I would've liked to mix it up a bit with activities other than discussion and the worksheets. Perhaps more formal group presentations might be nice. ",
            "\u00a0The course has an intense amount of readings and not enough accessibility to the professor. These two things could be improved to the benefit of the class. It was a good breadth of knowledge with regards to the subject material, but the workload was overbearing with weekly responses and a lot of readings. ",
            "\u00a0It can seem like the semester is wholly based on the readings from the first few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the class and the topics discussed. I think this class was really strong in also offering us enough support and assignments to guide is in our final essay. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Participation and the encouraging environment \r\nWeakness: Diversity in Assignments ",
            "\u00a0The course had a lot of reading each week, but if you started early it was not a problem. The readings were all clearly related to the week's discussion, so none of them felt unnecessary. The seminars themselves had great discussions and it was a great space to interact with the other students in the class and share ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The general structure (weekly topic selection and memo questions) were well-designed to facilitate an ordered investigation of the subject matter even-paced in content and difficulty.\r\n\r\nClassroom discussions can be better proportioned- I would like to hear more instruction from an authority of the field. Student participation is conducive to summarizing readings and insights but can become disorganized. Perhaps two mini-lectures starting and concluding each class that set the agenda and reinforce thematic takeaways. "

            "\u00a0I really would! If they're interested in the military at all, they will walk away with a different conception of it here. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you're interested in the topic and only if you Credit/D it, so you don't worry too much about the subjective grading for reading responses and the research paper graded by the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Having known nothing about civil-military relations before the course, I was continually amazed by what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended. Prof Lotito knows how to run a seminar! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The topic is so interesting and Prof. Lotito is the best. The small class size was great and every student was very engaged in the course and brought unique opinions to the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student interested in learning about the interplay between civilians and the military around the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, civil-Military Relations is one of the most important studies that many students overlook. Coup d etat, Private actors, military professionalism and civilian control are subjects that are so relevant today and necessary for someone who wants to work in national security. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in the subject or are at all interested in political structures, how governments work, or developing democracies, definitely take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Due to its relatively niche subject matter, I doubt the majority of my peers would give me much attention when I proselytize about the course. For the remainder, I would certainly recommend it for its content, design, and strong reading/writing components. "
