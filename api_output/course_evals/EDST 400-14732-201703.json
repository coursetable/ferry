            "\u00a0This was one of the most helpful and well-instructed classes that I have ever experienced at Yale. The course faces two challenges: to prepare students to complete their capstone and to expose students to the world of education research. This course did this expertly. For example, every week that we would talk about a specific methodology, we would learn about it through a specific text. Then, we would have the opportunity to speak with the author over Skype or in person about not only the methodology, but also the text. In addition, the class and the future advisors formed close connections through honest discussion of project design and education issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about different methods in research and the ways in which different education author have utilized them in their research. I grew my understanding of my thesis topic and was able to conceptualize and propose a concrete and strong idea. ",
            "\u00a0Learned different research methodologies and was able to prepare a capstone project design by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about different methodologies and the importance of really thinking about research questions. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained in this class ranged from the educational experiences of undocumented students, to the ways schools are portrayed in films, to the history of progressive education in America, to the ways in which power is created and exercised in classrooms. We looked at education as a site of study through various methodologies: history, ethnography, experiments, to critical analysis. \r\nMeanwhile, the skills I gained in this class were much more useful: how to pick a viable and pertinent research topic, how to design a capstone project, what an IRB is and how to apply for one, how to do an annotated bibliography, how to design write a project prospectus, etc. These will be applicable for any future academia of any students. \r\nLastly, I adored this class because in addition to these knowledge and skills, I was able to spend time with our cohort of EDST scholars. We definitely got to know each other a lot better in the course of the semester, and which made a great community. Learning about each others projects was one of the highlights of the semester, as its inspiring and heartwarming to see so many peers working on interesting and important projects. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned about a variety of different ways to think about education. These methods also influenced my thinking on other topics. ",

            "\u00a0This class covered a variety of different research methods that are used in Education Studies, and then let us start working on our ideas for our capstone project.  In addition to learning about research methods, by the end of the semester we had learned how to write a prospectus for a project. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different methodologies for conducting and writing about education research, and was able to apply them to my own Capstone project. I also strengthened my ability to write about original research and to conduct thorough literature reviews, which allowed me to gain deeper insight into my own topic and help prepare me for my own research.

            "\u00a0Strengths - incredible discussion and great to have a place for all scholars to come to the table together to disagree, discuss, and engage with each other and the material.\r\n\r\nweakness - books seemed unrelated to our work, felt like we spent unbalanced time learning eachother's projects and I would have liked to read one article or book that pertained to each of our different capstones. that would have prompted much more engagement with the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Introduction of various methodologies with guest speakers and workshops\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Organization of the methodologies with the workshops. The final capstone prospectus should have been turned in sooner before the end of the semester to get feedback and be able to submit IRB/make changes as necessary before break. ",
            "\u00a0We should just focus on capstones right off the bat. It takes so long to get research off the ground, with IRB approvals taking as long as they do, and with the world in general being as unpredictable as it is (i.e. it took me three weeks of persistent phone calling and emailing to finally reach a person I needed to get a hold of) ",
            "\u00a0Lets start with the positives: Professor Zemach-Bersin is really cool and badass. I cant imagine anyone but her teaching this course. She has an ability to take a reading, give it to a class, and through conversation, distill it down to its most essential and controversial and useful points. She was indispensable to helping us design our experiments and giving constructive but helpful feedback. More than that, I appreciated how she constantly tried to develop us as scholars. Each week, she forced us to confront the importance and meaning of our own work, and to take ownership. I am so grateful to her guidance. \r\nAnother positive: the readings. The knowledge I gained in this class ranged from the educational experiences of undocumented students, to the ways schools are portrayed in films, to the history of progressive education in America, to the ways in which power is created and exercised in classrooms. We looked at education as a site of study through various methodologies: history, ethnography, experiments, to critical analysis.

We definitely got to know each other a lot better in the course of the semester, and which made a great community. Learning about each others projects was one of the highlights of the semester, as its inspiring and heartwarming to see so many peers working on interesting and important projects.  \r\nThe largest weakness of the coursewhich I suspect will be resolved once the syllabus is reconfigured after the first yearis its organization regarding the capstone project itself. To be frank, no one in the class knew what a capstone project was supposed to be. I feel really confident in this assessment. We had all seen what the presentations from last year looked like, but we didnt know what the papers were like, how people chose their topics, and what our final project was supposed to be. Was it a long paper? Was it supposed to be original research? What about creative topics like photography exhibits and charter school proposals and childrens books; did everyone have to write a paper? \r\nIt honestly wasnt until Week 8 or 9 when we read past capstones when we actually got an idea of the end goal we were pursuing. But by that point, we had already done methodology papers and started annotated bibliographies, so some people really had to change their topics entirely when the finally came to terms. \r\nIn the future, it would make more sense for this class to have the example capstones/annotated bibliographies/IRB sessions earlier that way people have a better sense throughout the semester of what they should be working towards. I also have a number of ideas for ways to change the timeline and assignments that I have shared with Professor Zemach-Bersin. ",
            "\u00a0Professor ZB was absolutely fantastic and really carried the course. The readings were all very interesting and things I would not have encountered elsewhere. The pace of the course was a little strange but this was mostly a function of it being the first time this was offered ",
            "\u00a0I unfortunately learned very little in this course, which was disappointing because this was meant to be the capstone of our education studies experience. What I did learn was how to more closely analyze the methods employed by the authors of the books/papers that we read, though I do not think the skill was particularly well developed, considering most of the class barely did the readings. From my conversations with other students, it was apparent that our class became disengaged with the material and the conversation very early on in the semester. It was too easy to skim the reading, and then to come to the seminar and offer an opinion that the professor would agree with. I found that the greatest weakness of this class lied in the nature of the texts that we read, which felt like they had less to do with education and more to do with what the professor felt were the most pressing issues in her line of research, and in her opinion in general. It became clear to me very quickly that we were only going to be exposed to texts that were politically liberal in nature, which was frustrating considering we are seniors about to enter the world of education which is composed of the full spectrum of viewpoints--liberal, moderate, and conservative. While offering solely liberal texts on the syllabus is pretty standard at Yale, and while I typically don't mind because I myself tend to identify with these views, I have never been in a class that felt so extremely biased. It made me pretty upset, actually, since it felt like the only views we could receive and express in class and in our assignments were liberal ones. Especially in the education studies program, which knows the pedagogical value of being exposed to a diversity of viewpoints, this is a serious problem that should be addressed in next year's course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the other students and conversations, weakness was that it wasnt very structured with a clear goal. Too much reading and focus on academia instead of a more practical approach to education studies. ",
            "\u00a0Our discussions about research methodology were very insightful but sometimes they veered a bit far from our capstone projects. Some of my classmates and I thought that we did not spend enough time developing our own projects, which made the final assignments tedious. Nonetheless, the course was organized well and the themes built upon one another well. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if we could start working on our ideas for our capstone projects earlier in the semester.  The methodology reflection papers early in the semester weren't very helpful, however the different reading assignments that showed the different methodologies were helpful.  More feedback on each stage of developing my ideas for my project and prospectus also would have been helpful.  For both the mini prospectus, and the draft of the full prospectus, I felt like I didn't get much written feedback from the professor, which would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nThe deadlines for the assignments in this class were terrible.  One assignment was due on the sunday of fall break, one was due the Monday we got back from thanksgiving break, and then a subset of us were told to turn in something on January 1st.  However, we were not told that until after I had finished class, and was already traveling over break.  It seemed like none of the professors involved in planning this class had looked at an academic calendar at all.  While the first two deadlines just made my breaks during the school year stressful, the last deadline felt pretty unfair, given that there was no warning at all about the assignment before my semester ended and I started traveling.  Even though the assignment due on Jan 1st was quite small, I had limited computer and internet access the whole time, and would have preferred to get it out of the way earlier, before my semester ended. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main strength of the course is based on the fact that we are a close cohort of students who got to know each other, our unique interests and passions, and our research topics very well over the semester. This made it easy and useful for each of us as well as Professor Zemach-Bersin to provide thoughtful feedback and help guide each other throughout the semester in terms of what we were learning and thinking about for our own Capstone. I think it would have been useful to allocate more time at the beginning of the semester to brainstorming about Capstone topics and thinking through their feasibility; whereas I came in with a general idea of what I wanted to research, I know some of my peers struggled at the beginning to design their own topic and felt like the methodology reflections didnt really help them as much until they actually knew what they wanted to research.

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless it were changed so that students are exposed to a diversity of viewpoints and can feel comfortable expressing potentially unpopular or opposing viewpoints in class, in assignments, and to the professor. I would also caution students that class conversations can feel somewhat circular and disengaged, since many students skim or do not complete the readings. Unfortunately this is not surprising, since it was easy to predict what policies, opinions, and perspectives the readings would offer in advance, since they all seemed to align with a certain political ideology. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for any student in the Education Studies program. ",
            "\u00a0Im really glad the Education Studies Program introduced this course as mandatory for all senior scholars! I cant even imagine coming up with a Capstone topic, conducting a literature review, and conducting original research all in one semester. I think the general outline of the course was designed with our skills and needs in mind, and I learned a lot about how to conduct education research, something most of us have had little prior experience with but that might be crucial in many of our future careers. I loved how close our cohort got and thought it really allowed us to be open and honest with each other throughout all our little joys and frustrations in the process. I definitely think this course set me up well for the Capstone course next semester! "
