            "\u00a0This is such an unfortunate use of tuition dollars. It's absolutely nothing like how it's advertised in the course description, syllabus, and even during the first week of classes when the professor makes it seem like it will be really engaging. It's not. We were promised robust discussion every week on an interesting topic--during the course of the semester, we had exactly 0 discussions. The first half hour of class was spent waiting for late students to arrive, as the professor refused to start class without them. The professor just brought in last year's students to tell us about their career plans and interests (3-4 weeks of this), and the rest of the time we watched National Geographic videos that I could've streamed on my own time. There are no assignments (at all--not even readings), which might seem like a blessing at first but quickly gets old when you realize that you're not learning anything at all. This course has no strengths. I came into it very excited and was just beyond disappointed by it. ",
            "\u00a0It covers some important topics in public health. Some of them are fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Hoh clearly means well, but she puts minimal (possibly zero) effort into teaching this class. She very obviously had no lesson plans or discussion topics. She talked constantly about her favorite previous students to the point of annoyance. Also, she had a bizarre thing about not starting class until the males had arrived--out of 11 people there were 8 females and 3 males and the males were often late to class, and she would say every week that we needed the males to be there before we could proceed (specifically saying \"we should wait until the males get here so that it's not just the females.\" No idea what this was about but it was fairly insulting.
