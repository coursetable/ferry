            "\u00a0In this course I learned a vast amount about the ecosystems of New England, how to identify trees and other plants, how humans have played a role in the ecosystem, and the threats and preservation tactics involving New England's ecosystems relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class! In the class you learn tree identification, how to understand and analyze the forest landscape, and the significance of different elements in the forest. This class made me think about the natural world in a whole new way! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify common trees and plants in New England, as well as the geology, land use history, and general ecological concepts and principles that govern our forests. ",
            "\u00a0This class completely revolutionized how I see the natural world around me. Not only did I learn how to identify over 50 plant species, but I learned how to interpret the land use history of the forest by its physical attributes alone. I also have a greater appreciation for and understanding of the career paths of foresters and environmental scientists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only how to identify trees and plants, but also how to notice everything in the natural environment.  Reading the landscape of the forest and understanding its place in New England's natural history has helped me learn how to be more aware of my surroundings and the natural world in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to pay more attention to the world around me, and how intricate ecosystems can be in a particular region. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to consider how different elements of the forest contribute to the overall functioning of the ecosystem. I thought a lot about human impact on the land  throughout history up through the modern-day consequences. Also, I learned the value of time spent outside, especially repeated returns to a single spot. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course has completely changed my view of the natural world around me. Previously, I never really paid attention to the different types of trees that was around me. Now, after this seminar, I am more aware of the different species of trees in my surroundings and can identify them and talk about the type of land they grow on. I also learned how to begin to identifying trees, like knowing what characteristics to look for. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to Identify 50+ plants of the New England forest, and the tools to learn to identify virtually any broad leaved tree. I learned to read the forested landscape and, to some extent, to read the natural land use history of the land through its physical characteristics. I gained many insights: what we say is \"natural\" or \"native\" is simply what european botanists happened to record when they arrived to New England, Native americans heavily managed New England's land, Disturbance is a very central and important concept in ecology and facilitates change in an ecosystem.

            "\u00a0It was extremely interesting, informative, and fun. I especially liked the fact that the course was structured around field trips. I cannot think of any way to significantly improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are that it is very engaging and the professor is great! Every class is field base with trips to so many cool places. The only weakness of this class is that it takes up a four hour time slot so it is a big time commitment but it is definitely worth it! ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible.  We got to go outside every week, and we learned so much about the forests of New England.  This course was definitely the highlight of my semester, and allowed me to better understand the ecology and natural history of the area in which I live. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: entirely a field based course, small class size, all the students were engaged with the topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams and final project were not well defined and were a bit unclear ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the field-based model of learning.  Getting to travel all across Connecticut to see different ecosystems and environments is extremely valuable when learning about the species composition, natural history, and land use of a particular place.  The hands-on learning each week made the course more enjoyable and facilitated understanding of the content.  One weakness of this course is the fact that it takes up such a large chunk of time in each student's schedule for one day each week.  Additionally, the readings were sometimes too lengthy or had parts that seemed irrelevant, which I think caused a lot of people to skip or skim them. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that we go outside every week for class! It's truly an amazing way to get out into nature. I think it could be improved by making the readings more clear and targeted to each class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun, fascinating, interactive, got to experience Connecticut and orient myself to the area, the small class size built a great community\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Large block of time interfered with many activities, Saturday field trips were difficult to schedule around, sometimes difficult to reach Place in the Woods between inclement weather, early sunsets and busy schedules ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was its weekly tree-ID quizzes. I think this definitely helped me prepare for the midterm and made sure I knew the material. On top of that, it was really helpful to go over the answers immediately after the quizzes were handed in. The professor helped clarify any confusions and reinforced the information by going over the quiz. Another strength was that it did not feel overwhelming at all. The class was not bombarded with a heavy load of assignments (only readings, occasional writing assignments, and a weekly visit to our chosen spot in the woods to record observations of changes that occurred in our place). The only weakness, for me, was that it was difficult for me to figure out/learn to figure out how to evaluate the land in a way that told me of its history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the coarse was engaging, exciting, interesting, relaxed, and a bonding experience between classmates\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the journal entires for homework were fun, but towards the end I felt as though I was running out of things to write about. Maybe they could be more structured and have assignments focusing on the things we were reading about or learning in class that week. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I learned a vast amount about a topic one doesn't normally get a chance to learn about in a classroom setting, and I thoroughly enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who likes the outdoors and wants to understand nature better. This course was my favorite class, you will love it! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly incoming first-years who want to feel more connected to their new home in CT.  I cannot stress enough the difference it has made in my first semester of college having some time each week to spend outside, learning skills that will be useful to me, no matter what I pursue in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any student who likes nature, regardless of whether or not they are considering a major in environmental studies. It is a great way to connect with nature, learn about the natural world around you, and explore any natural science interests you may have. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. A first-year seminar is a great way to get acclimated to Yale, and this course is the perfect first-year seminar. Getting outside each week to see different forest ecosystems and environments across Connecticut is an experience that should not be underestimated. This course will teach you a lot about tree identification and environmental observation, but more importantly, it's actually a lot of fun.  If you like to be outside and want to learn more about the environment, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even if they have no background in STEM. There are weekly quizzes that can get kind of tough over the course of the semester, but it's worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. This course will force students to look at any forest in an entirely new light. After learning so much about the trees and the ecosystem, it is impossible to not carry this knowledge base with you as you spend more time in Connecticut or return to your home forest, wherever that may be. Also, for students who love the outdoors it is a lot of fun to get out of the classroom and spend an afternoon hiking outside every week. I will warn that the required journal entries at East Rock Park took a significant amount of travel time, they were enjoyable but not convenient. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course to other students! It's a class where you get to go on field trips every week and learn about trees and natural history. You'll get a chance to explore the immense amount of nature in Connecticut, and learn about the land history of the state; this includes how Native Americans, colonists, and other people throughout history have used the land. By the end of the course, you will be able to identify over a dozen different types of trees and know about their habitats and characteristics. Take this class if you like nature, and weekly field trips! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COARSE!!! what other coarse goes on a field trip every single week!!! The material is interesting, it may seems surface level since we only learn common names of plants (not latin) but in reality the material teaches a pretty deep knowledge of how to read the forested landscape, and basically deduce how the land has been used in the past by colonists and native Americans. Marlyse is a great teacher and very fun to learn from. Since the class is all first-years, there is a ton of bonding betweens students on the bus rides and you'll end up very close with your classmates. "
