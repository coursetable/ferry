We defined an outer measure and a Lebesgue measure. We also defined continuous functions, measurable sets and functions and studied the approximation of a measurable function through simple functions and step functions. We also studied the concepts of a Banach space and of a Hilbert space. W also looked at the concept of differentiable functions, the Vitali covering lemma and maximal functions. ",

High level-wise I gained more of an understanding of basic analytic ideas like approximations than were presented in 230/231. A pretty standard math course in that you learn a lot and do a lot for problem sets. ",

After almost every class you can leave knowing that you have learned something.\r\n\r\nFew weaknesses. The only thing I would have liked better was if we discussed the expanse of Real Analysis and what exactly it means. ",

Problem sets really drill the material, exams are fair and feasible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really, perhaps assigning a problem set over spring break was rough, and having them due before both midterms was also inconvenient. ",

However, the problem set difficulty was somewhat inconsistent, proofs done in class often got very confusing due to errors made (and corrected), and I felt that the grade depended far too much on tests, which were also of inconsistent difficulty and often too time-restricted. ",

            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of very difficult material. Prof Oh did a reasonably good job, but a large portion of class time was devoted to long and heavily involved proofs which she went through at just too fast of a pace for me to follow them as well as I wanted, but took long enough that it impacted the time we could spend on problems and questions. The homework was useful and very challenging, but I wish there had been more problems and some at a lower level. I also wish more class time had been spent on examples; they were always very helpful in building intuition with this very foreign subject material and I often wanted more. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the lectures were generally well-organized and delivered in a manner that was clear and easy to follow. However, I wish that the course was slightly restructured. I appreciated how we did a systematic and thorough treatment of measures at the beginning of the course, but the second half of the course jumped between various topics such as L^p spaces, differentiation, and Hausdorff without going too much in depth into any of them. I think it would be better if we focused more on one or two of these topics (or even Fourier series, which was included in the syllabus but hardly mentioned in class) rather than jumping around. I also think that the problem sets could have been better organized, with more moderately challenging problems rather than problems at the extreme ends of the difficulty spectrum. ",

            "\u00a0The course covered a good breadth and depth of materials and homework was generally good for reinforcing concepts; grading was fair. A weakness would probably be the textbook, which I didn't find very helpful as I don't think it added much to my class notes. ",

Additionally if you are a student interested in mathematics, this course is also introductory enough to facilitate a passion for math. Also if Prof. Oh is teaching this, definitely take it with her if you can. ",

Felt very intimidated at first, at the pace the professor was going and how it seemed most of the class was following, but with enough work and persistence, you'll be able to follow along for most of it. Really shows how beautiful (and rigorous) math is. The construction of the Lebesgue measure and integral are very interesting and eye opening. ",
            "\u00a0I personally loved the course. I would recommend the student shop it and see if they like the lecturing style and the material. Although we took it with Hee Oh, who is amazing, I've heard other professors who've taught this in the past have been terrible. I took this concurrently with 231do not do that unless you are very well prepared, as it can be quite overwhelming to be thrust into an upper level math class like that, especially since 231 is technically a pre-requisite. However, you definitely don't have to take 301 in order to take this class. At least with Hee Oh, everything was defined from first principles and as someone with no background in the material I still did really well. \r\n\r\nOverall, fantastic class, but quite hard, and perhaps not a subject that everyone will relate to.

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to a student who has never taken an analysis course, at least not with this teacher. I had a rough semester in general with some health concerns which of course made the ordeal much harder for me, but I found the class very difficult and wished I had waited longer to take it or had taken 301.\r\nIf a student is confident they have a strong background and will have a network of friends in the class for support and problem sets, then this class would be a challenging but rewarding experience. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Really I'd recommend anything with Professor Oh. I came in not having taken any kind of calculus or analysis for three years and I enjoyed it so much I wish I had been studying this all along. This is the kind of class that makes me proud and glad to be a math major. Perfect mix of rigor and intuition in the material. We covered a lot -- my list of theorems and definitions from this semester has 113 entries -- but everything built logically on what came before so it never felt like we were jumping around or moving too fast. ",

            "\u00a0This seems like a fairly standard real analysis course and it's well organized/taught so I'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Very good class. Take it for sure if Professor Hee Oh is teaching it. But I believe it requires some experience in analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Professor Oh is not an engaging instructor and neither does she seem to keen on helping students learn and grasp concepts. Questions and doubts seemed unwelcome. The class is not organized, there are no practice problems or support structures to facilitate improvement. There are much better classes to take or other professors who could create a better classroom experience. "
