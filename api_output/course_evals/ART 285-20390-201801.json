            "\u00a0A phenomenal appreciation for the work and diligence required to take a production from start to finish, beginning with idea and carrying it to completion as a polished, smooth work. ",
            "\u00a0Software: learned to use Maya, Unity 3D, SteamVR, also was introduced to a lot of resources such as mixamo, long winter studios, MCAP project\r\nAlso learned some principles of animation, very helpful ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to animate in 3D using the software Maya and Unity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do basic animation, world-building, camera-angles, etc. on Maya and Unity. I also learned about the history of animation, some basic tricks of animation, how to make animations seem more natural, and when/how to exaggerate poses and movements. "

            "\u00a0This was an unbelievable course, and truly ran as well as possible, especially given the small class size and therefore the individual attention resulting from it. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: a course that teaches skills highly valuable in the entertainment industry, but not offered at yale before. By taking the course you also get introduced to a myriad of resources, events and people at Yale CCAM. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I hope the course had more structures. Maybe we should have a lecture session and a studio session, separately. ",
            "\u00a0The class has very interesting topics, I just wish there were more structured assignments.  It felt like we spent an entire month on walk cycles. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is how much it requires you to interact with the subject at hand each week and the step-by-step tutorials that we get in lecture. One weakness of the course is that the deadlines are irregular and suddenly announced (i.e. only two to five days ahead of time). Because a lot of the work requires being present at the CCAM, and even small projects take about five to six hours, it often felt like I had to arrange the rest of my schedule in order to fit the needs of this class and sacrifice my time/work in other classes. I think that having and/or more closely following a schedule would be good for the class. Posting tutorials of what we did in class online would also be helpful, because Maya and Unity have a lot of features and it is easy to forget steps. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course to anyone with a computer science or art background. This is a wonderful way to explore novel technologies and engage with them in an academic environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend to students in computer science or arts major. Anyone interested in technology, computing and the arts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone else if they were willing to learn software that can be more frustrating than rewarding sometimes.  If they are willing to spend hours or even a day on something that they might not even be able to use later on.  However, once you finish a project, it feels pretty good to have those new skills in your toolset. ",
            "\u00a0I would say take it if (and only if) you're willing to go all out for it. The workload is huge, you will likely be expected to do more than you think you have time for, and you likely will spend a lot of time outside of class working on the projects at the CCAM because other computers around campus don't have the software. (It's free to download, but can be more difficult to work with on laptops.) All that being said, you actually do learn how to use the animation software and you will be surprised at how fast you go from stretching a sphere to building worlds and animating human characters. Once you learn the basics, you have a ton of freedom regarding your final project and you can make basically whatever you want, whether it be a music video, a game, or even a virtual reality experience.
