            "\u00a0Carla is truly an expert in the field of early childhood education, and listening to her speak about it was quite enlightening and enjoyable. It was particularly interesting to learn about aspects of education and see them in action during our weekly classroom observations. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to evaluate early childhood curricula and classroom environments in relation to developmental appropriateness. I learnt about the policy challenges related to improving early education. I learnt about how children develop all sorts of skills: math, language, reading, writing, social and moral. I also learnt about the teachers role in aiding this development and coordinating with parents to ensure that the home to school transition is smooth. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of those rare classes at Yale in which you can actually observe the curriculum in real life and apply the lessons you've learned. Although you learn a lot about appropriate childhood development practices and the state of early childhood programs in America, I think the most important thing I learned was how to properly teach and raise a child. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt an awful lot from this class. Being around Calvin Hill really made me evaluate and think about how children learn (in relation to class material). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to observe children and look for indicators of emotional, social and educational development in an classroom setting. I also learned a lot about the theory into developing an early childhood education curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0After taking Professor Horwtiz's class, I have developed a deep  understanding of the importance of having early childhood curricula and environments which are informed by research and psychological theory related to early development. Moreover, I have am more fully aware of the societal issues which exist in American society that pose challenges to equitable access to high quality early childhood programs. "

            "\u00a0One of my favourite classes at Yale by far. The class is easy to follow and class discussions are very engaging. Not having a laptop in class really allowed us to fully immerse in discussions. The observations are so fun and I really felt like I was a part of the class by the end of the semester. The progression through the topics allows for more in depth analysis as you get further into the semester. Some of the reading materials are very eye opening and taught me things about my upbringing and childhood that I had never thought about. ",
            "\u00a0This course is intrinsically very interesting and its strength is the strong practical component. However I think it could be improved if students could meet in groups with the teachers of the classrooms they are observing. That would allow the students to understand the dynamics of their classroom better and be prepared to observe. Another place of improvement could be the readings that are assigned. There were some redundancies and I believe that if there were fewer and more differentiated readings, it would add to the impact of each piece. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a lot of interesting readings, not too much writing, and a once a week observation period which is often the highlight of my week because the kids are adorable. The biggest problem with the class is its location. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - very time consuming and location is far\r\nStrengths - everything else - very engaging seminar and enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings seemed a little old but Carla mentioned that a lot of the current theory is still based off these old books, so maybe not actually a weakness. The class is really unique and nothing like any of the classes Ive taken at Yale. Great structure of readings, mixed with observations and integrating those two in a seminar style classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course good at accomplishing its goal. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellently designed and the practicum is very useful. If anything, it would have been useful to have more opportunities to speak with the teachers at Calvin Hill. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Definitely. Not only is it a great writing credit (if you're not looking for an English class), but it is interesting material with not too high of a workload. The readings are long but fun to read! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class was very accessible and engaging, even for someone whose major is unrelated to Education or Child Studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because it is an eye opener. I learnt so much about American politics and history through studying early childhood education. I also learnt about child and adult psychology and how to be an effective observer and listener. Plus I got to meet the wonderful kids and teachers at Calvin Hill! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student, particularly those interested in teaching or early childhood work. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - it's something different and a great writing class if you aren't into writing lots of papers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone! It is a fantastic class and Professor Horwitz is just amazing. I learned so much about child development and every lecture was engaging and interesting. It was amazing to spend time with the kids and see in practice what we were learning about theoretically. We heard first hand from the teachers and this was especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you ever want to work with children in the future, this class prepares you well for that. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you get the opportunity! The class isn't super hard; you have seminar once a week and spend 2 hours observing at Calvin Hill Preschool. You get to become an integral part of the kids' school and learn a lot more from being in the classroom with the students and teachers than you do from doing the readings. It's very cool, fun, and not a ton of work ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it was an amazing experience not just for the education but to work with children and understand them better. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take professor Horwtiz's class if you are interested in early childhood development and developmental psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Dr. Horwitz's class has been all around perfect this whole semester. There are only five written assignments required by the class, on top of a final paper. The readings are also not that long and are super interesting. Initially, I thought Calvin Hill would be way too far and time-consuming to walk up to, but it definitely isn't that bad. There are also several shuttles that take you up there if you time it right. Great class, take it if you can! "
