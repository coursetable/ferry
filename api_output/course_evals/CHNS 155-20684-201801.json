            "\u00a0I was able to hone my skills in chinese. Great continuing class if you just took 150/151, and a good spot to keep learning and mastering your ability to speak more formally and with a wider vocabulary. Zhou laoshi and the TA are both fantastic and dedicated, I highly recommend the course! ",
            "\u00a0Chinese vocabulary/phrases/writing skills etc ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of formal chinese characters and written vocab. Lots of chengyu, not much vernacular speech. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a little bit of Chinese language and a lot about Chinese society and culture. "

            "\u00a0great! ",
            "\u00a0I think it could emphasize speaking a lot more than it did. Too much emphasis on chengyu and reading even though I did learn a lot and can read much better than at the beginning of the semester. My writing also became much higher level. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the class is that it's really focused on Chinese culture and history, and I've learned a lot about those topics through this class. Zhou is really knowledgable on these things and really passionate about sharing his knowledge. Zhou is also an incredibly reasonable man, very flexible about deadlines, and a really gentle grader. However, I think the class is very poorly structured for language acquisition - we practically never talk in class, and Zhou often finishes our sentences for us because the only times we're ever talking are when we're doing grammar drills that he has written. We never actually USE any of the things we learn in class, and for this reason, we immediately forget all the words and grammar patterns that we're learning. There is absolutely no creation or generation using the content that we're learning, just memorizing patterns and specific sentences that Zhou has written. Even the structure of the tests reflects the lack creativity - Zhou usually gives us two \"discussion questions\" to prepare for the test, but he gives us the question and the answer in advance. For the test, we have to literally memorize the answer that Zhou has given us, including using the exact words and sentence patterns he gives us. There's never any critical thinking or high level discussion in this class, which I think is a real shame, since the whole point of learning a language at such an advanced level is to prepare us for interesting, generative, and productive conversations in that language. I think this is the primary weakness of this course. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This class is fantastic and necessary if you're working your way up to the \"L6\" level chinese courses. I learned so much! The cool thing is its not just language, but a lot about chinese history, society, and culture with discussions that often bled over to my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to take other classes in the Chinese department. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to get to high level Chinese classes, you have to take this course. I'm disappointed because I don't feel as though my Chinese, especially oral Chinese, has improved through this course. I didn't learn much, but I'm excited because I'll be able to take interesting L5 courses next year. "
