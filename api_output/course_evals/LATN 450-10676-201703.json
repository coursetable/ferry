            "\u00a0Excellent bridge class. Prof. Solodow goes over all the Latin that has been assigned to translate for class. The class is spent going over the translation and discussing it and the greater implications of Roman society. ",
            "\u00a0Ease of translating, understanding, and interpreting the latin ",
            "\u00a0Better translation skills and overall more knowledge about Roman culture ",
            "\u00a0I became more proficient in Latin translation and went over a few grammatical points. I also gained knowledge of the overall culture of Roman dining as it related to classism and numerous other themes, which was very interesting ",
            "\u00a0I've already taken L5 Latin at Yale, but this class helped further improve my ability to translate as well as engage critically with texts on a level beyond just the grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as if my understanding of roman culture in the context of dining and beliefs surrounding food has greatly improved. Further, my understanding of Latin grammar was also improved by the course as well as my ability to translate. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, I really feel I improved my grammar and sight reading. It was also new to me to analyze the Latin texts as literature, rather than simply focus on a correct translation alone, so this is a new skill to me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I wish we hadn't done Horace 2.2 and that once Prof. Solodow decided he didn't like it, he would have not made it the 2nd essay prompt. I also wish there were no pop quizzes but don't we all haha ",
            "\u00a0The course presented a wide array of material which make a seemingly straightforward topic of Roman Dining an insightful one into daily roman life. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: there is a large emphasis on not only translating Latin, but also learning about ancient culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It got a little repetitive doing the same exact thing in class each day (translating). ",
            "\u00a0We did a great job looking at each assigned text. As it was a bridge course, we spent the majority of class time translating, which got tedious, especially toward the end of the semester when it was clear everyone was around the same level. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course may have been the breadth of the course as it felt like a lot was covered, which made it a lot to process. However, the variety of material was also a strength as it made the course more engaging, as well as I gained a lot of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This class had a fairly wide range of Roman authors to read from. However I think the translation exercises were weighted a little heavily for what they were "

            "\u00a0This is an awesome class to fulfill a language requirement. The workload isn't terrible, and it's very predictable (I mean that positively). Prof. Solodow sticks closely to the syllabus so there are no surprises throughout the class.\r\nThe workload consists of a sizable but certainly manageable chunk of Latin to translate for each class period. There are two essays and two formal translations as well. Not bad at all. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if you are not a classics major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone bridging AP Latin with college Latin. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic class! Professor Solodow is incredibly knowledgeable and an excellent teacher. It is impossible to go through one of his classes without reading Latin and writing better essays than you did at the start. Do not be daunted by his old school approach or the seemingly challenging workload, he is a great person and fantastic professor and the workload is very manageable - his classes usually have a goodly number of assessments so you have plenty of chances to do well. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class, and fun, too! Definitely a good introduction to high-level Latin at Yale, and it seemed no one was left behind in the readings/translations. The quizzes were fair and not hard to prepare for, the essays were graded kindly, and in-class discussions made the class time fly by. ",
            "\u00a0Don't worry: This isn't a muscular fluency-and-grammar course. Prof. Solodow has a flair (and respect) for literary criticism, which made the readings much more exciting -- you get to actually read them! There were a few texts that we short-changed a bit, in Latin or English, thanks to time concerns, but for the most part LATN 450 is a wonderful opportunity to pause and think about Latin poems as poems -- as art, as discourse -- not ciphers or historical documents. While the latter half of the class made more explicit room for literary interpretation, Prof. Solodow is aways accommodating and appreciative of comments in that domain, -- and often has a visible spark when someone arrives at a particularly salient point! My Latin improved, and so did my motivation for learning it in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course tot other students. I found it difficult but worth it because I took a lot out of it If a student enjoys Latin and wants to solidify their background, this is a great course . ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a challenging but good introductory Latin course for those who had taken a few years of the language in high school "
