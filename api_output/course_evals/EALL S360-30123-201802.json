            "\u00a0A greater understanding of prominent Japanese works of literature and film. I learned common themes and of the social climate of Japan throughout the various decades that the works we examined took place. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive but slightly vague survey course on essentially literature and architecture in Tokyo. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to how blind I was to the Japanese culture, and is a testament to the assumptions we as Americans make about other countries. I not only gained a greater knowledge of Japan's history and culture, but it also made me see the flaws in my own country both politically and socially that we still have yet to tackle. ",
            "\u00a0This course reignited my interest in some of the skills and knowledge about literature and sociology that I experienced during the Common Curriculum in Yale-NUS College. I revisited some materials that I was taught during the Common Curriculum and tried to made links with this course. It has helped me gain a better understanding and appreciation of the humanities in Tokyo. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class provided me with greater exposure to literature, art, and humanities from Japanese history and culture.  To be more specific, the readings and screenings provided me with an opportunity to spend my own time to take a deeper look at the humanities in Japan, and how they reflect social views and perspectives in modern-day Tokyo. ",
            "\u00a0Besides writing and analysis of texts, the course prioritizes learning about Tokyo and Japan overall in a diverse, both formal and informal way, through filed trips, cultural activities and personal exploration of the city. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a good overview of Japanese culture (literature, architecture, film, pop culture etc). "

            "\u00a0The discussion and themes regarding the films and works of literature were excellent, insightful and truly interesting. They furthered my education and made me become a more worldly individual. Perhaps shortening the time of the homestay and allowing us to live in a dorm for part of the session would allow students to feel more comfortable and better able to explore the city. Since we visit a fair amount of Buddhist temples, incorporating some time of the course to giving a bit of background on Buddhism and the significance of the landmarks that we are seeing would provide a deeper understanding and respect for some of the places that we are seeing. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the level of engagement we had with the city itself. The excursions were fun and enlightening. I thought the course could have involved more discussions and use of media (videos, websites, documentaries, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I felt that the reading catalog was a bit shortsighted or misrepresentative. It is also kind of a dull idea to do an entire course in Tokyo and having kids stay at a homestay when they speak none of the language because the Tokyo that exists in English is very tiny. ",
            "\u00a0The materials given were interesting but the class itself was rather boring. Perhaps, we could do my group discussions and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0The course highly emphasized discussion, but was largely filled with large amounts of lecture that would occasionally drag on.  While the nature of seminars is to encourage critical thinking and different perspectives, it often seemed like that perspectives and opinions that seemed more critical of the texts, screenings, and lectures would often be dismissed by the professor.  However, hearing these perspectives from my fellow classmates definitely were enlightening and eye-opening in their own unique way.  While the texts were often skewed in terms of perspective and narration, they overall offered a refreshing view and understanding of Japanese culture, although some critical essays had some Orientalist or potentially questionable perspectives.  As an improvement, I think it would be nice to be able to incorporate student perspectives as alternate points-of-view rather than \"wrong/incorrect analysis.\" ",
            "\u00a0Strengthes: the focus on different topics and media and relative freedom of choosing a topic to focus in your papers. The professor is also interested in accommodating your specific interests about Japan/Tokyo. ",
            "\u00a0the syllabus was interesting and it was pretty disappointing to not really get to talk about it in class as much as we probably should have. \r\nThe one thing that was a structural problem for me in the course was that after the second paper, we got to choose our own topic for a research paper which was great, but did mean that we had a lot less incentive to come to class having done the reading. The professor did try to structure it so that the end of the course was mainly movies and tv shows but still it got hard to stay motivated. Especially when a few people took issue with every movie or show we were supposed to have watched but then admitted after class they hadn't actually watched the whole thing and only saw the clip shown in class...

            "\u00a0The course material and intended content of the lectures would be recommended, but I would caution them to also base their decision off of who else is in the course. Most of the lectures and course material was never fully discussed or completed because several students in the class took it upon themselves to directly challenge and disagree with everything the professor was saying, for the sake of being difficult. This had a high impact on the ability to enjoy the class, as it was often filled with an atmosphere of disrespect towards the professor and towards other students who disagreed. Due to the class being small, this was a major factor and definitely took away from my ability to enjoy the class. This was because of the hostility, and inability to cover the full intended lecture plan. ",
            "\u00a0Eh, probably not. Unless you're trying to get 2 quick credits. Also would see if you like Seth's teaching style. Lectures can get pretty tediously boring sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if that student does not know Japanese, and is looking for an excellent way to learn more about Japanese culture. This course provides a fine segway into immersing oneself in Japan beyond tourism, and the books that are read for the course are  very informative of both the history and evolution of Tokyo from eastern power to a respectable, global power. ",
            "\u00a0The experience of studying humanities, film, and literature of a specific country while simultaneously being in a country is, in my opinion, enough of an experience that I would overall recommend this class to other students.  However, I would recommend some structural changes to the way the course itself was designed.  In terms of content, having more diverse authorship and perspective would be nice.  Additionally, I think that having a more open-minded instructor would be beneficial, given the subjective nature of the concept of humanities.  While my classmates were capable of discussing their opinions, the instructor didn't seem to view these discussions as potential ways of exploring thought.  Instead, the instructor turned the course meetings into debates about why our perspectives were incorrect and how there is only one correct way to read a specific text.  However, if a potential student for this course is interested in participating in outside-of-class discussion or student-to-student discussion, I think the scope of the subject matter is excellent for that potential student ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great opportunity to stay in Tokyo for a month and have time and resources to explore the city. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you haven't done a homestay/been to Asia/need 2 credits/are vaguely interested in Japan. The course itself was really interesting but your classmates are luck of the draw. "
