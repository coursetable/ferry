            "\u00a0though the models we learn in this class use many assumption and are not completely transferable to real life, they are great quantitative ways to learn intuition about different market scenarios ",
            "\u00a0This course was a more practical application of Intermediate Microeconomics. I learned more about firms' decision making and how market structure affects market outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0I can honestly say that this is the course I learned the most in terms of sheer quantity of material in my time at Yale. We learned so many types of economic situations and how to evaluate them qualitatively and quantitatively. Yet it somehow never felt overwhelming, it's only in retrospect that I realize how much we covered. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to represent many real-life scenarios using several different economic models related to market power, product differentiation, collusion, and advertising, to name a few of the many concepts we dealt with in this class. I thought that everything we learned was interesting and extremely applicable to everyday life -- for example, we also went over case studies on how all of the concepts we learned could be seen in the airline, car, diamond, etc. industries. ",
            "\u00a0Reviewed a lot of material from Intermediate Micro, as well as learned a lot about a variety of topics such as venture capital, mergers, and product differentiation. ",
            "\u00a0This Economics course built on the concepts in Intermediate Micro to address the most interesting and relevant cases of market environments. Because this was a theory class, much of it related to the structuring of equations in isolated environments, but it gave us all a lens through which to view the activities firms engage in. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to solve a variety of problems related to competition, advertising, transportation costs, venture capital, etc. Similar material to Econ 121. ",
            "\u00a0ECON 409 was a great course that allowed me to truly become comfortable with some of the tools introduced in intermediate micro. I think it serves as a great case study of more abstract concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about major topics and models in industrial organization, including price and quantity competition, vertical and horizontal differentiation, advertising, entry deterrence, and mergers and acquisitions. I improved my ability to solve maximization problems and two-stage games, while also improving my quantitative and critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Great class that taught analytical skills and problem-solving very effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a better understanding of the microeconomic analysis of certain business decisions "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is so well structured, I wouldn't change a thing about it. ",
            "\u00a0The course could go even further to apply microeconomic concepts to real life scenarios. The case studies could be better integrated into the course material, to make it clear how the mathematical models relate to reality. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was how well it was taught. Mathematical problems were walked through in a very intuitive way, with every step being explained in real world terms. For example, if an integral was negative Chalioti would say 'This makes sense intuitively because...\" So it never seemed abstract, even when the math was. I didn't feel there were any real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this class! The workload was very reasonable; the problem sets were appropriately challenging and helped me get a much better grasp of the material. The lectures were incredibly clear and well-organized as well, with plenty of references to real-life applications of the material we covered in class. I also really enjoyed the case study presentations -- I learned a lot both from researching for my own topic and listening to other groups' presentations, and I think they really solidified my understanding of the relevance of our course material in real life. The exams were fair and matched the practice problems given to us. The only thing I wold really change about this class is that lectures could move a little faster, especially through steps involving basic mathematical derivations. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that, firstly, it is taught by a really great professor. Professor Chalioti really understands the material she is presenting about, and is very knowledgable in terms of both economics and math. The course also does a fairly good job of relating the topics learned in class to real world examples. One way in which the course can be improved is maybe relating these topics even more so to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chalioti is the most engaging and clear professor I have had in and Economics course. She manages the delicate balance between breaking down concepts into bite-size pieces and maintaining their complexity in her explanations, which helps both with knowledge retention and engagement. Both of the classes I took with her have been fair and well constructed, and I enjoyed the way she presented the material. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized and tests are very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class! Eva is the most wonderful professor and the class was super interesting/fun. We also had presentations on different topics that we covered. Would recommend the class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: honestly, none that I can think of. There was so much room for us to give feedback to Prof. Chalioti, and she made our experience an invaluable one. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job providing examples to help students learn how to solve new types of problems, then giving students the opportunity to apply them on their own. One potential way to improve the course would be to design exam questions so that the parts do not build on each other, which would prevent a simple mistake in one part from being carried throughout the rest of the question. Another suggestion would be to shorten the length of the earlier problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very well-structured and taught course. It has been my absolute favourite clas at Yale so far. Not only have I learnt very interesting theories about how firms compete within markets but also we were able to apply our knowledge in real-life examples. The greatest strength of this course is Prof. Chalioti. She is so caring and really wants all of her students to excel. I would not say there are any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. ",

            "\u00a0Eva is the most caring professor I've had while at Yale. Take the class ",
            "\u00a0This is one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Eva is a fantastic lecturer, super nice, and very helpful. I loved intermediate micro with her, and this class was almost an extension of that with new models. I would highly recommend this class if you like microeconomics and quantitative models. It's one of the most straightforward classes I've ever taken - no curveballs will be thrown at you. As long as you understand what goes on in class and on the psets, you'll be golden. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who found Intermediate Microeconomics interesting, but wanted to see the concepts applied to real life more tangibly. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of my favorite courses ever. Absolutely loved it. Would recommend to non-Econ majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class! If you liked ECON 121 with Prof. Chalioti, you'll enjoy this as well -- it builds on a lot of concepts from intermediate micro. The class is extremely well-organized (one of its biggest strengths, especially since so many econ classes and Yale classes in general are so disorganized), with six, reasonable problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Prof. Chalioti's lectures are extremely organized and easy to follow (sometimes a little too much handholding), and she is always so enthuasiastic about the course material. The best part of this class was having plenty of opportunities to see how the course material can actually be applied to situations in real life. Each lecture included many examples of firms and industries relevant to what we were learning, and the case study presentations were a fantastic way to explore how multiple economic models can apply to different industries and competitors. I really feel like I walked away with a solid understanding of a lot of the forces that shape markets in our everyday lives. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting econ seminar taught and if you can take it with Professor Chalioti, she genuinely cares about her students and teachers the material very well. The first part of the course is a review of a lot of topics covered in Intermediate Micro, while the second part of the course relates to topics that expand upon the first part of the course, such as mergers and venture capital. It is a good amount of work with six problem sets, a midterm, and a final, but as long as you go to class and pay attention, the problem sets are not too hard. Definitely a very math-based course, similar to what you would do in Intermediate Micro. The best part of the course was doing a case study where you could relate what you learned in the course to actual companies, such as comparing companies like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. ",
            "\u00a0Good, manageable class that takes many of the concepts you learn in Intermediate Micro and apply them to advertising, research investment, and mergers. Great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, its like intermediate micro but a little more challenging. Chalioti is an angel. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Great class. Had a lot of fun in the class and Eva is an amazing professor. Exams were fair. Homework problems were also based on the material we covered in class. Psets took maybe around 5 hours a week. Take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is most certainly interesting and the material is not too hard. Mostly, it is SO well taught. Prof. Chalioti is BY FAR the best Professor in the Economics Department. Cannot recommend this enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are looking for a senior seminar in Economics and who have taken Intermediate Micro. The course uses economic models to provide interesting insights into competition. The real-world examples used in the course were especially interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Favourite course at Yale - Prof. Chalioti is the best. Absolutely take this! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0If you liked intermediate micro and calculus (taking derivatives), this is the perfect class for you. Eva is also just an incredibly helpful, sweet, and excellent professor. "
