            "\u00a0Great class on a very specific period and region. We got to speak with a lot of very interesting individuals who had first-hand experience with the Troubles. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the more interesting courses I've taken at Yale because it covers such a niche topic area. Within the narrow topic of Northern Ireland, however, the course gives you a little bit of everything--some history, analysis of the various paramilitary actors, the peace process, the role of the British government in all of this, and contemporary problems (political polarization, segregation, etc.). Northern Ireland is really one of the most interesting places I've ever read about. Even though this course was outside of what I would normally take in the political science department, I found this course to be really exciting and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely interesting and thought evoking. It focuses on civil strife in Northern Ireland throughout history, but mostly between 1968 and 1998 during \"the Troubles.\" Because the focus of the class is more specific or narrow than many other survey type courses at Yale, you are able to learn a lot more about the people and ideas involved. I think this helps you understand what may instigate and grow conflict elsewhere, as well. In addition, the class has a large focus on skyping with people who were and are a part of the conflict and peace keeping in Northern Ireland, such as people who were in the IRA or government or helped write the Good Friday Agreement. You are able to ask them questions and listen to their stories. The readings are also interesting and accessible. Many are first person accounts of the events, others are historical accounts, and others are academic papers which apply to that week of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I know A LOT about the very specific political/social history of Northern Ireland. Highly niche, but so fascinating. Gained an understanding of issues of nationalism, paramilitary violence, BREXIT, lots of other stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I had a great time researching and paper-writing! Loved this class for the topic it introduced me to! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Weir is by far the best professor that I've had at Yale. Not only is she very in the theory on conflict and terrorism she stresses the practical realities of conflict in all of her classes. She stresses student engagement so if you just want to sit back and do nothing do not take her class. "

            "\u00a0Having all the speakers Skype in was definitely great, but I do wish that sometimes we got more time to discuss amongst ourselves in class. Towards the end of the class, some of the topics became a little bit repetitive. It would be interesting to perhaps contextualize the Troubles within other similar civil conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all of the speakers that we heard from each week. Each speaker had a unique perspective and experiences that they brought to the discussion, and it was really interesting to see how the speakers' accounts or opinions differed (or were similar) as the semester progressed. However, I think that there should be more of a balance between time spent with the speaker and the class' own discussion or student presentation. There were many weeks where we barely got to discuss the readings we had done because the speaker took up most of the time. \r\n\r\nThere should also be more consistent feedback given to students throughout the course. There are several written assignments (questions for/reflections on speakers, plus two short written assignments) as well as the student presentation, but we never received grades on any of this work. I felt like I could gauge how well I was doing in the course, but it also made it a bit stressful to go into writing the final paper with no idea of where I was standing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is everything it should be. It is the best class I have taken at Yale. My only suggestion for improvement is either more feedback or grades throughout the semester. I am still totally unsure of where I stand. ",
            "\u00a0The range and quality of speakers who took the time to talk to us was such a cool experience that is not that common in Yale undergrad courses, so that was totally novel and very interesting. In general the readings assigned to us were useful, topical, and provided important context to the discussion of the week. I liked the way the class was split between student presentations, class discussion, and speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Great course in which I learned a lot. The frequent guest speakers were both a plus and a minus, as perhaps I would have liked to hear more of Professor Weir's opinions on the issues at hand. Still, was a great opportunity to learn about a specific context from a variety of perspectives. Was particularly refreshing because a portion of the class had personal history or connection to the conflict, making it harder to exoticize key issues. A class on terrorism in the Middle East might have a lot more people talking a touch more ignorantly about religious and cultural determinants of violence. ",
            "\u00a0i wanted there to be more time for discussion, but overall a really unique gem of a course!! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and the speakers were fascinating to hear from. I definitely gained a better understanding of the political determinants of the Troubles. However, the readings got a bit repetitive towards the end, and I think because we had so many speakers talking about similar angles, the pace of the class slowed by the end. "

            "\u00a0If you're not super passionate about Northern Ireland, don't take this class, or else you will want to scratch your eyes out every week in seminar. There's a guest speaker almost every week in class that takes up the majority of discussion, so that was, while interesting, not particularly instructive nor helpful for learning of the material. Professor Weir is a gem, but the material is very dry unless you come in super engaged already with it. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Good to take if you don't really take classes that focus on specific conflicts or regions but are interested in doing so. The small scope of the conflict makes it easier to understand, and you leave feeling like you now have a fairly good grasp of the Troubles. ",
            "\u00a0It's such a fun course! I think it's a must-take for people who are interested in IR, especially security. Even for people like me who do not focus on IR within the political science department, it is such a cool class, and it's really something that you'll probably never learn about without taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It is extremely interesting and well constructed. The class makes you think about humanity and life and what you might fight for. The discussions are engaging and the Skype sessions with people in Northern Ireland are illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. If it seems too niche for you, it probably is, but that meant that the people who took the class were all engaged and invested, which was awesome. Northern Ireland is an absolutely wild place with a fascinating (and often tragic) history, so this class provided so much excellent analysis and context of the history and current political situation in Northern Ireland.  Worth taking for the speakers even if nothing else (although everything else was great too!) because Professor Weir knows everyone who has ever been involved in anything in Northern Ireland, so we talked from people ranging from former paramilitaries to one of the diplomats involved in writing the Good Friday Agreement to the Canadian general in charge of decomissioning paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland. And Professor Weir is awesome and super knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if at all interested in the Troubles and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0I tentatively recommend this to you. As with any seminar, it's only as good as the students. A lot of people just didn't do the reading or would just scroll on facebook during classes. The speakers were helpful, but also seemed repetitive after a while. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely suggest this course to any student at Yale. Prof. Weir is by far the best professor that I have had while here. Her course balances theory and real-life experience of the people directly effected by conflict. Class participation is major part of her seminars. So if you want to just hang out and not engage in discussion this course is not for you. If you want to actually learn about the realities of conflict- with the most entertaining set of guest speakers at Yale- then you want to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course if the student is interested in various political lenses of the Troubles. It is fascinating to hear from first-hand speakers, and the workload of the course was low enough to make everything out of class enjoyable. However, I would caution that the material can get repetitive and students seemed to tune out somewhat by the end. "
