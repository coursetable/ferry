            "\u00a0In contrast to typical high school writing assignments, I learned how to construct a paper that wasn't academic in nature, but rather one that was thought-provoking and allowed for creative expression. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing style and the authorial persona, as well as to be able to break down a reading into its component parts for analysis. I think it was a good course on personal, non-fiction, essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0better writing skills ",
            "\u00a0Learned techniques in nonfiction essay writing ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me to appreciate the craft that goes into creative nonfiction writing, and it familiarized me with some of the major techniques/styles of nonfiction writing. It also helped me develop confidence in my writing and made me comfortable with writing about a broad range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze essays, seeing what techniques writers use to keep readers engaged. I also learned the importance of the revision process and that I need to spend significant amounts of time with each essay. ",
            "\u00a0How to criticize. How to praise. How to adopt writing style. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to freshen up my writing skills! ",
            "\u00a0Since this course focuses more on craft instead of content, I learned a lot about how to structure, revise, and create compelling essays. There's a reasonable amount of reading -- usually great essays from The New Yorker, Norton Reader, etc -- that gives valuable insight into how good writers work. The workshop classes were also a great time to receive feedback and learn how to give meaningful feedback to other writers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the way a person can write in a way that makes people want to read; I liked how the class focused not on the texts as standalone bodies but on the way an author made conscious choices to create a \"machine\" for reading. "

        [
            "\u00a0The seminar style of the course is useful in encouraging discussion and participation. The content we read was interesting, engaging, fun to read, and provided great examples of diverse styles in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I think the format of this class is great. Writing five essays over the course of the semester gives you a good taste of a range of creative nonfiction writing. You submit a draft and a final copy for each essay. The draft is ungraded, and you receive comments on it before submitting the final copy. In seminar, you mainly discuss the readings, which I found super interesting and manageable (they're mostly pieces from The New Yorker). I don't see any major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There are different types of essays so the course doesn't get too bland.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the same themes come up. Also, the teacher will say one thing during the first draft and another during the final draft. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great feedback on writing. Great classroom discussions.\r\nWeakness: Had to wait a long long time for feeback at times. Readings were not always interesting. Readings were quite long at times which made the discussions suffer because not everyone would read them. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class: most of the readings, seminar discussions, and workshops were fantastic. Professor Sexton was a super engaging instructor. However, I do wish that the feedback on essays was more timely and that there was less variation -- or more standardized grading -- between the 120 sections (some sections had essay topics that we didn't cover, vice versa). ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great at looking at a range of essays and encouraging group discussions that included the whole class (some seminars are often dominated by only a few voices). My only piece of feedback would be that I sometimes felt like we kept looking at the same things in every piece we read: for example, we often spent a lot of time each class talking about the lede of each essay when I felt like there were more interesting components in the body that went unaddressed. Having said this, I do think a lot of important stuff was covered and the assignments really helped hone my skills as a writer! "

            "\u00a0I elected to take this class without understanding that a general sentiment among students is that ENGL 120 is a more challenging course than ENGL 114, but I ended the semester with this being my favorite class: as it was a small section, we were able to engage in genuinely interesting dialogue and bonded not only with our classmates, but Professor Sexton as well. I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to be exposed to a new kind of writing, not to mention interesting readings that don't take long to read at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it since the class is fun, it's a good writing credit, and it can help you develop skills for writing personal essays or other kinds of narrative or story telling. But, it does not necessarily improve your academic writing, so take note of that. Also, like with any English class, grading is subjective, so it's useful to know your audience. ",
            "\u00a0yes! the essays are very fun to write and the readings/discussion are always interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their essay writing. It is useful for any student, not just English majors. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a perfect intro to creative nonfiction writing. The readings are fun, assignments will push you to experiment, and it's a great way to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course definitely improved my writing and was fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I looked forward to our class discussions most days. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the course most times ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'd recommend this course for students who are interested in writing or are prospective English majors -- it just gives you much more creative freedom than a 114 seminar. It's also a great chance to receive insightful, detailed feedback from instructors and peers. Mostly, it's a lot of fun! ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped improve my voice and confidence as a writer through practice and reading. I found that- by the end of the course- I could write an essay a lot quicker than before and really enjoyed the process itself for writing. The classes are a bit repetitive (read an essay before each class and discuss it), but if you put the work in you will see an improvement in your writing! "
