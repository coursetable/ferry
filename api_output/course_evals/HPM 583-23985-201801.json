I was able to write down all of the content from the lecture slides on a piece of paper and then did excellently on the exam but did not really learn anything at all. Having students memorize concepts would help them retain their learning. 2. The group project did not really function well. Splitting up tasks and having 1 student do the stats analysis and another student present means that not everyone in the group is able to learn from each part. For example, I have 0 understanding of the statistics we did, as my job was to write the literature review. This was frustrating, especially as a woman, to have the men in my group take on the stats coding and push the women off to the \"softer\" parts of the assignment. Would prefer if all group members had to take responsibility for all parts of the assignment. And, would like there to be a group member evaluation component where each person writes a review of the other members -- we had a couple people do nothing for the project but will still get a good grade. 3. There should be less of a focus on \"examples\" in lecture and more content provided. I didn't learn a ton from the extensive examples and would have preferred more learning. 4. The time of the course should be changed -- it's hard to learn when you're hungry b/c the class is in the middle of dinner. ",

            "\u00a0It was really difficult to understand the aims and organization of the course.  We dwelled on some topics way too long and others not enough.  I think I would have learned more had I just skipped the lectures and bought a good book and read it at home.  This class desperately needs a strategic overhaul. ",

I wish the TAs would actually go over the lab powerpoint during lab so as it answer any questions we may have about the slides/overall understanding of the topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found it very hard to follow the professor's explanations in class, his points were not clear and some concepts were not well explained. The slides were hard to follow in retrospect and taking notes was hard since everything was PDF (I would suggest making PPT slides so students can take notes more easily as you go along). The suggest book for the course was even more complicated to follow. It may be because this subject matter is taught with an economic lens/health policy lens and for those of us who have statistical experience mainly from math, biology, chemistry, etc - it is hard to follow. \r\n\r\nThe group project at the end was a VERY frustrating experience. Of course ultimately, a lot of that depends on group members and group dynamic, but part of it has to do with the chosen project. I think my group overcomplicated matters, but it would have been nice to get more instruction and professor/TA opinion in choosing a feasible project with a feasible database. We did explain our idea to the professor who OK'ed it only to find out later that our project was almost impossible. This seemed like a preventable issue. \r\n\r\nI do have a lot more knowledge on linear and logistic regression, but I can't help but feel that I could have learned much more had the lectures been better presented, and the group project ran more smoothly.

Combination of professor who was on the low-engagement side and a 5-7 pm timeslot made class enthusiasm low though.\r\n\r\nDon't let people waive out of this! I have heard people talk about gaming the system to never take it and avoid it and I don't think that's right. This is a valuable course that everyone should take! ",
            "\u00a0It would have been helpful to have more guidance on how to complete the labs and homework assignments in lecture. The lectures covered necessary concepts, but the TAs quickly skimmed through the lab presentations which left many students confused. The labs built on one another, so this should have been emphasized in the first few sections so that we could correct our mistakes as we went along.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to have formed my own group for the final paper/presentation/project, rather than have an assigned group.\r\n\r\nAttendance at lectures was extremely low because many students did not find value in attending. Students felt that it was easier and more time-efficient to read the slides on their own. The content and research methodology is extremely interesting, and I wish that I could have felt this excitement more while taking the course. ",

This course contains concepts of metrics from basic level to advanced level, and introduces them in a very well designed structure. The lecturer is very sensitive to students' response and feedback. I also like the SAS programming skills and the final project. ",

The course's final weeks, which focused on analysis 'tools' like IV and RDD, were particularly interesting and, for those interested in research, helpful. The professor was friendly and responsive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor did a poor job of motivating or framing the course. While the importance of the material was immediately evident for those interested in research, for many others, especially the HCM students, the value of this information was not clear. Lecture would often run over time, requiring Professor Chen to finish one lecture during the next week's session: This disrupted the flow of the class. ",

I was definitely able to use the knowledge and skills gained in other classes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Group project. It would be great if we could do peer evaluations for the project. Some students in my group completely dropped the ball and did not contribute fully to their part. For example, the Friday before our presentations the people in charge of data analysis had still not started, so I, the writer, spent 7 hours in the lab on Friday trying to do the data analysis. It also seems like those who do the data analysis do the most because those doing the presentation and writing have to understand the data analysis, so even though I took notes, took picture of the code and SAS output, and did a write-up, my group members still requested my help and input every step of the way. ",

            "\u00a0I really liked learning tangible modeling and analysis skills, which I think will be very transferable to work after graduation. While the homeworks and lab sessions were helpful for cementing these skills, I do not think the group project was that valuable. The suggested division of work meant that only a few people actually did the coding and analysis, which meant that most group members did not actually gain anything from the project. Also, my group project experience was unnecessarily stressful, with one of my randomly assigned group members taking over the coding in the end and not really explaining any of his work, leaving the rest of us to try to figure out what he meant in order to complete the write up. I think having more extensive modeling homeworks, potentially even ones where we choose our own data set, would be a much more valuable learning experience. ",
