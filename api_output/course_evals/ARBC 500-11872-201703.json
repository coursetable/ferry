Students were given chance to practice speaking, reading, writing, and listening in class, they were all very helpful. \r\n\r\nI would like to practice more on Shami, although I acknowledged that Shami is a spoken dialect, I found it difficult to speak immediately after hearing from the video, it would be helpful if we could have the written form and the set of grammar rules.
