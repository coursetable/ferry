            "\u00a0The EU and the Euro remain dizzying concepts in my head, but approaching the subject now is less daunting. I did not receive the deep understanding promised in the syllabus, as the course felt more like an econ class than a poli sci class, but exposure to the topic was full and nearly comprehensive. I better understand what the EU is, what the Euro Crisis is, which countries were involved, and what the trajectory of the EU is. ",
            "\u00a0Each country's involvement in the crisis, the european union's institutional weaknesses and strengths, the future of the european project. ",
            "\u00a0The course helped me better understand the global economy in a political context. Due to the specific focus on the Euro Crisis, we were able to really flesh out multiple aspects of the crisis and understand the interactions the crisis had with EU politics. ",
            "\u00a0Analytical reading skills, discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the economic crisis in Euro ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a fascinating opportunity to learn about international organizations, global financial systems, and monetary policy through the lens of the EU. I wanted to push myself to understand Econ better and this class was a really interesting way to do that since we discussed a relevant and interesting context. ",
            "\u00a0Helped me with reading and writing social science papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the structure of the European Union and its financial organizations. Additionally, I learned a fair amount about general macroeconomic terms and concepts that applied to the Euro Crisis. I learned a bit about writing political analyses and definitely became more comfortable with reading them. "

            "\u00a0Strength: level of engagement was high. Aslanidis is patient, recognizing that he often moves too quickly for some of us. Aslanidis also offers insightful discussion and perspectives through which to approach these concepts. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the class was overwhelmingly econ-heavy, such that it was very hard to follow along. If you're comfortable with macroeconomic concepts applies to real world events, then this won't be a con for you. The class was also very academic, such that at times the discussion felt unapproachable. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was amazing. I learned so much and really came out of the class with a greater understanding of the EU and the Euro Crisis ",
            "\u00a0Very intriguing material and very well presented. Expectations of assignments are very clear. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured and the workload is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were in the amount of knowledge I gained - I know so much more about the European Union and the Euro crisis than I ever thought I would.  The discussion was extremely well facilitated, Professor Aslanidis is one of the best seminar professors I have ever encountered.  He also lectures well when it is appropriate.  Parts of the seminars deviated into lectures a little too much, and the course could be improved with perhaps slightly more discussion in the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0There could have been more discussions about the future of EU and how EU relates to other regions ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter is fascinating and I think Paris does a great job of selecting the readings for each week. The workload was manageable. I wouldve preferred if the seminars were more discussion-based. When we did have discussions they were very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0More feedback on writing would be good. I also would have liked if the writing assignments were more balanced throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of this course were its generally interesting and pertinent topics, the freedom of topic choice for the final paper, and its overall structure. Some weaknesses were slightly intimidating discussions, some tedious readings, and unclear paper expectations and grading. It could be improved by more focus on how to write/improve your papers. Some sort of peer/professor review would definitely help for people unsure of what to improve on their essays. "

            "\u00a0Yes, the class is difficult but Aslanidis is a good professor and will devote the time to helping you get through the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's such an interesting topic and ties into so many facets of academia. If you're interested in European politics or the world economy, this is the course for you. Professor Aslanidis is tough, but his teaching style is pedagogical. He really pushes his students to do their best work and is clearly very passionate and knowledgable about the subject. It's a tough course, but I feel like I really grew as a student ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It was a very interesting class and the professor is engaging. The discussions are interesting and relevant to current issues. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  You do, however, have to be willing to do the readings - this course is largely what you put in is what you get out.  There are a lot of readings, and many of them are quite dense, but they are very important to the course if you want to get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about monetary and fiscal policy, as well as how international bodies attempt to shape nation state decision making, this is a great class for you regardless of whether youre interested in Europe in particular. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I would tell another first year that it was much harder than other classes I took. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Aslinidis is amazing and genuinely cares about his students, and loves the topic hes teaching. The class is engaging and informative, and the assignments are very manageable while also making you feel like you genuinely learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in European politics and economics. It is an engaging and far-reaching curriculum that covers many current topics in the field. However, I might advise them to have some background in both fields or else be prepared to spend some extra time learning terms and ideas. I would say to be wary if you do not have experience (a.k.a non-major or first year) in political science and economics, as you may not know how to write/discuss them to the expected level. "
