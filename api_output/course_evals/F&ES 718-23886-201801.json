            "\u00a0I gained greater confidence in reading and synthesizing scientific literature and a greater understanding of the effects of climate change at a global scale. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most scientific literature I've read in one course, not counting textbooks. I feel like my ability to process such material has improved. The technical side can still be tough, but I'm getting better at being able to understand the conclusions and broad outline of the methodology without getting bogged down on the details that I don't understand. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a wide range of topics dealing with the effects of climate change, some that I had never even heard of before or learned about in other classes. Taking the class also reminded me that just because I may come from a science background, it is still okay if I take awhile to read and understand scientific articles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not to be afraid of talking to scientists. I became more confident in reading scientific papers, and I don't think I will be as anxious when reading scientific papers in the future because I learned that my classmates are generally just as confused as I am when I read them! I learned about inland water greenhouse gas emissions, hurricane intensity, drought and fires, etc.---all in reference to climate change. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading and querying of scientific articles on various climate change topics\r\nGreater confidence in speaking with authors and researchers on their work\r\nAn appreciation for the range of questions and topics that can be touched on for a chat/interview with an author/researcher\r\nNew knowledge of emerging science and revelations related to climate change\r\nAn appreciation for various journal article writing styles, layouts, vocabulary - and how publishers, editors, etc. may influence these ",
            "\u00a0As a student with a social science background, this course helped me learn how to read, translate, and understand scientific papers in various climate change subjects. ",

            "\u00a0I expected to gain an understanding of key climate change subjects, but I did not anticipate that Pete would arrange for students to gain a deeper understanding of the scientific papers by interviewing the authors of the papers. This was a really invaluable aspect of the class that exceeded my expectations and made the experience more meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very difficult course for me as I don't have a research background, however after a couple of weeks I started to feel more comfortable reading the papers. The Monday discussions were very useful to better understand terms, concepts and to clarify doubts. I was expecting to learn new concepts, and to get a scientific perspective  of climate change-related issues. Trough the course this goals were achieved. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: I love that we could speak with scientists who live anywhere. This was a great use of technology in the classroom, one of the best I've seen!\r\nWeakness: I'm not sure the work we turned in - just writing two paragraph summaries - really helped me learn that much. It was just busy work. While I like having an easy course and I'm sure Pete benefits from having less to grade while doing his research, asking us to write a four-page paper on some aspect of the class might make sense. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include being able to communicate with the authors of the papers we read over Skype, and being able to ask them questions about their research. I don't know of any other classes where you do that, and it felt good to put a face to these scientists. It did feel a little intimidating to ask them questions about their work, especially if one of the questions you had came from a lack of understanding about the subject matter. So in this case, sometimes I felt obligated to choose my questions carefully. But I felt the professor was very understanding that a lot of the students did not come from science backgrounds, and therefore may not be familiar with the subject matter. Or even if you did some from a science background, it did not automatically mean you knew about the subject matter. It was also nice to hear the professor themselves admit that they didn't always understand the subject of the paper, and had to look up things within the paper they were uncertain of.\r\nThe class was very laid back, but that does not mean we did not discuss a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that you get to see how your peers interpret the same scientific material that you read. You also get to hear how the instructor analyzes information. It's great to see how other people process the material. The course could be improved by recording the lectures with the scientists and putting them up on Canvas. Several times over the course of the semester, I wish I could have watched a video recording of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- small class allowed for more open interaction among students in weekly discussion\r\n- new topics each week broadened/deepened my understanding of these areas over a short space of time\r\n- interviewing skills building ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are Pete's instruction and commitment to helping students gain an understanding of the subject matter. Pete always slows things down for questions and engages well with students. Pete understands that not all students come from a scientific background, but also built the syllabus around papers that students wanted to read/subjects that students wanted to learn more about. There were no real weaknesses to this course. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the variety of the topics. Having a different one every weeks made the course very interesting. The opportunity to have a conversation with the authors of the papers was highly valuable and having classmates with different interest and backgrounds was enriching. However, regarding the topics, I would have liked to read more papers related to adaptation to climate change. Also, some of the paper were highly technical, thus, it was very difficult for me to get the main points. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- The professor makes a good job on helping explaining technical questions\r\n- The weekly presentations of the guest scientists are very interesting and often the content gives you better understanding of the topic\r\n- Scientist presentation include additional graphs\r\n- Workload is pretty mild\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes the topics are very hard to understand without the appropriate background\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n- Perhaps choosing a topic of interest at the beginning or middle of the semester and doing a little bit more of digging into that topic. Find research for the topic and contact the scientist with the professor's support to create a short paper or summary, or do a presentation to the class. "

            "\u00a0Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Even if you don't plan to focus on climate change in your career, I think this would still be a good course to take in order to gain a better understanding of the subject matter. I also think this is a good course for those coming from a non-science background, and don't have a lot of experience reading scientific literature. Because we only read one paper a week, it gives students the chance to focus on reading that paper as many times as they need to fully understand it. And any questions they had about the content, they can ask the professor about. If the professor does not know, then he may suggest asking the author about it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to learn about climate change if you are from a non-scientific background. ",
            "\u00a0Take! This is an excellent seminar for students with an interest in the science and emerging research underpinning our currently knowledge of climate change, in a relaxed, open environment that facilitates discussion of perspectives, but also of our uncertainties (with respect to our own knowledge and interpretation) of the weekly topics and concepts. The class presents a rare opportunity to directly interact with authors of recently-published papers, and to have those authors describe their journey, their work and their outlook going forward. The weekly workload is very manageable, but for students largely uninitiated in the physical science basis, the course will teach a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to read concise, yet dense scientific papers that may take 2-3 reads before the methods and science become digestible. It is very important that you ask questions when needed as the material is highly technical. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend reading the paper several times and it is very important to read it carefully before the Monday session. The discussion sessions are key to get answers to questions that might be basic and to get a better understanding of basic concepts, so don't miss them. Be prepared for the live sessions with more than 2 questions to ask the speaker. ",
