If we had everything set up about 10 minutes earlier, that may help to streamline the process. I remember one day a good number of students had arrived early and sat down, but the sign-in/food were not available. Then we had to exit the room to get into the line for food and sign-in which took 10 minutes or so. Otherwise, I think everything is working well! ",

My only criticism is that I wish that we had more frequent speaker sessions. I think we had 3-4 speakers this semester, and I would have loved the opportunity to attend more! ",

There should be more focus on social determinants of health and how those intersect with chronic diseases. I think conversations on social determinants of health are very important in public health.

But the exams might be a little bit rigorous, emphasize much on distinguishing concepts(different study design) or using the formula, I would prefer to spend more time doing homework or reading some contemporary articles in this area instead of spending much time preparing for exams.
