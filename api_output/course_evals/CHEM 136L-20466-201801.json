The quizzes are not difficult, but often students performed poorly because they simply had no idea about what to study. Grading is harsh and nit-picky, and labs consist mostly of titrating and waiting. \r\n\r\nOn the positive side, you will encounter an active and supportive network of teachers and TA's who will bend over backwards in order to help you understand something better.

They will take you hours and hours to write and you will be marked down for the most minute and irrelevant things. Prepare to be extremely frustrated with the grading on reports! Basically all the points I lost had absolutely nothing to do with my understanding of science or lab skills, but my choice of formatting. The quizzes are also pretty difficult but generally fairer than the lab report grading (except the sig figs, which are way overemphasized for no apparent reason). Dr. G is extremely set in his ways, so I would say there is no point in trying to reason with him. ",

The strengths are the engaging lecture and the ability to do hands-on learning. The biggest weakness is the time: you can get the experiments done on time, but a few were very stressful, which may lead to lower accuracy. ",

I think its borderline criminal that Yale only gives 1/2 credit for a course that meets 4 hrs per week. Dr. G. will argue that he makes it a point to say on the syllabus that we should not be spending hours of time on lab reports, but in order to meet such specific standards, the lab reports require (at least) 8 hours of additional work, which is simply not fair. Additionally, numerous TF's seem to have this weird superiority complex that they have developed as first year grad students, which I find utterly hilarious--they nitpick lab reports, and often fail to understand the lab manual and procedure. Quizzes are also weirdly worded (but I'm glad Dr. G. listened to us last semester about how much they should be worth). Pre lab lectures don't need to be almost an hour. I'm sorry, but the concepts and lab are not so complex that we need to go on a 10 minute tangent about Gibbs (and how the CRB should be changed to the \"Gibbs Chemistry Building\"). This length for pre lab lectures wouldn't be an issue if we weren't so crunched for time in all of our experiments--literally every single week. ",
            "\u00a0Strict grading on lab reports. Pre-lab quizzes were stressful but the pre-lab lectures were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the labs go complement the lecture course fairly well and do help to understand more of the complex research concepts we can't really go into in lecture.\r\nWeakness: it is designed to make you fail and hate STEM at Yale and stay up late the night before every lab and stress and not get enough sleep. Sure it is only a half credit and doesn't count that much toward GPA but the majority of students taking this course are pre-med and are very high strung when it comes to grades. This class, although it does help to teach concepts, is extremely detrimental to mental health. The lab conduct grading system is also extremely dangerous for students health because if they make a small mistake in lab that could potentially put them in danger, they can only ask for help at the risk of getting a grade deduction. Instead of creating an environment that allows for mistakes and is safe for learning, students are in constant fear and strive to hide all mistakes from TAs and the professor. Deducting points for spilling chemicals should not be allowed because it discourages students from asking for help. ",

I understand that one of the class's purposes is to teach students how to write a formal lab report, but I feel that taking off points for small errors, such as lacking tick marks on graphs, is a bit excessive and will drive a lot of students away from the field of chemistry. The lab reports usually took hours to complete outside of the four-hour lab, but since the course was only worth 0.5 credits, it seemed like a lot of our hard work was for nothing. The course should be based more on our knowledge of chemistry rather than our ability to use Excel. Furthermore, points would sometimes be taken off on lab reports without any further explanations than an abbreviation for what type of error it was (for example, SF for sig figs), and because the scores wouldn't be posted on Canvas until several weeks later, it was hard to improve on the later lab reports without knowing what to improve on.

While there are days in which we do not use the full lab time, enough of it is used to still feel as though it is more than half a credit once the hours per one lab report and quizzes are factored in. We learn lab practices and what not just fine, but psychologically, it's annoying when you're told all this work is half a credit. I don't even care much that it is half aside from the knowledge that the workload itself is not reflective of that, and even an acknowledgement that this course is work wise more than half credit while keeping the system the same would make me feel better.

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is how it complements what is learned in general chemistry lecture and design of the lab procedures. The weakness is basically every other aspect of the course. The grading is inconsistent, often with insufficient feedback or reasoning. The grading system itself is oftentimes very arbitrary and not adequately communicated. I fundamentally disagree with the things that are emphasized in labs and lab reports (as in the meticulous detail concerning graphs, accuracy of data, etc.). I also feel that pre-lab quizzes do little to aid my understanding of the lab or understand the calculations. Rather, they are just exercises in brute memorization of lab calculations. These concerns were raised to Dr. Ganapathi at the end of the 1st semester. In his 1st lecture of the 2nd semester, he said he received this feedback (especially that regarding lab quizzes) and would make no changes because he disagreed with us.\r\n\r\nI think this class could be infinitely improved in three ways: 1) by standardizing a grading system where individual aspects of the lab report are worth points and you gain points rather than lose them for mistakes, 2) by focusing on self-reflection and procedural analysis in lab reports, and 3) by eliminating or fundamentally changing the quiz system.\r\n\r\n1) The grading system as it stands now is arbitrary, poorly designed, and poorly communicated. Although many of the mistakes that will lose students points are detailed in the syllabus, those mistakes oftentimes are arbitrarily ruled on. Sometimes, I'll lose 1/2 a point for a mistake in the purpose section of a lab report if the mistake is deemed minor. Sometimes, I'll lose a full point if it's deemed major. That is outlined in the syllabus. What isn't outlined is losing 2 points on a mistake deemed \"super major.\" At multiple points this semester and last semester, I'd lose arbitrary amounts points for mistakes that are outlined in the syllabus. Sometimes, I'd lose as many as 4-5 points out of a 50 point lab report for making the same mistake (not adding tick marks to my graph axes) multiple times, as if I was supposed to realize I was making the mistake while I was doing the lab report. And all the while, I was losing points for mistakes that aren't outlined in the syllabus as well (like accuracy of data). To fix this, Dr. Ganapathi should apportion points to individual parts of the lab reports proportional to their overall weight in the lab report. So, if there are 7 major calculations and graphs in a lab report, each would be worth five points with the purpose, data sheets, and general formatting of the lab report being worth 5 points each. And the scale would shift depending on how many calculations and graphs there are. That way, you can't lose more points than a section is worth (which has happened on a few occassions for me). Adequately communicating to students what will be graded and how harshly is also essential. Finally, graders must stick to the grading system.\r\n\r\n2) Very rarely does a lab report ask me to analyze procedure and look for potential errors in procedural design. Troubleshooting and looking for where variation might be introduced into data is what science is about, not formatting graphs to one person's liking. More time and points should be allocated to this pursuit rather than to how things should be formatted.\r\n\r\n3) The quiz system is terrible as it stands. It should either be eliminated (since it causes an undue amount of stress for a 0.5 credit course) or revamped so it actually tests familiarity with concept and procedure rather than brute calculations. Asking students to read through the protocol and note 2-3 points where variation could be introduced would be much more useful than the current set-up.\r\n\r\nI doubt any of this feedback will be incorporated. Dr. Ganapathi has demonstrated an unwillingness to incorporate constructive feedback. I hope this will help to change that or at least bring attention to the problem. ",

I also think the lab reports are not always designed in a way that helps me actually understand the material (for example, a large part of one of the lab reports was just marking things on graphs, which felt silly to me because I understood the concepts but making so many little lines on excel was the time consuming part). ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths were Dr.G's pre-lab lectures. I thought they were very direct, clear and helpful in conducting the experiment as well as writing up the lab report. However, one tiny weakness of this course was the points they would take off for the purpose of the lab reports. A lot of the time I thought the grading of this was inconsistent and unfair. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to drop your lowest quiz and lab score is very useful, especially because some of the quizzes can be quite tricky. However I think the final lab and exam should be worth more than what they currently are, so that you can have a chance to improve your grade at the end of the year with a good score. \r\nIf the course has one weakness, it's that the lab reports need to be very detailed, and formatted in a specific way. If you do it wrong, or miss some things, it can really hurt your grade for that lab. ",
            "\u00a0This course prepares students well for basic laboratory chemistry. Beyond that, I think there's a tremendous amount of busywork. The workload for this course makes it feel like a full credit. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course's strengths is the bonding of students. Since it is rigorous, students bond over lab days and lab reports. It's weaknesses is the lack of fun material. The course is very dry. It would be better if the labs were more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Dr. G is a great lecturer and I got better understanding of chemistry concepts from this course than I did in actual 165b lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the Lab Reports can be way too difficult sometimes and are graded harshly by some TA's and much more generously by others. ",
            "\u00a0The class helpfully covers topics that you need to understand before progressing further in biology or chemistry. At times, it's more focused on concerns such as percent error and cleanliness of glassware than on grasping more basic concepts like the reactions that are occurring in the exercises, but I understand why those topics are still included in the curriculum. I think Dr. Ganapathi has too much responsibility for too many aspects of the class. It would probably be more enjoyable if more of the responsibility was delegated to TAs and he was free to be concerned about teaching the concepts -- this would allow him to focus more on the really important aspects of the material while leaving the housekeeping aspects of the course up to others. He is a good lecturer and gives clear explanations, in addition to being helpful to students, but the class forces him to be spread too thinly. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is its relative compatibility with CHEM 165. It really helped to learn the concepts in lecture and then go to lab to experiment on these concepts, so I would know what to vaguely expect during the experiment. A weakness of the course was the variability of the lab report grading. Since a different teaching fellow would grade the lab reports each week, I could never expect what would be counted against. I would highly recommend if the lab report grading was as consistent as the quiz grading. ",

            "\u00a0Everyone takes this class in order to fulfill a prerequisite. Better put: no sane person takes this class unless it is necessary. Beware harsh grading, disorganized content, poor instructions, long hours, and a large workload.\r\n\r\nThis class is very formulaic. You attend pre-lab lecture, you take a quiz, attend lab, and complete a lab report. This seems fair up front, but it is not. You will be performing egregious amounts of work for half a credit. Grading is very strict, and the material does not always correlate with class. Be prepared to lose 15/50 points because your graph was too small, or receive 0/50 points because you wrote something in pencil, not pen. The labs themselves are easy to complete, but you will still spend three to four hours doing repetitive tasks. Heuristic learning has its benefits, but a worker on the assembly line doesn't gain vast knowledge about how their product functions. And that is what you are: a worker on the assembly line. You will be titrating, measuring, measuring again, and waiting. Rinse and repeat. \r\n\r\nHere is some math. To be generous, let's say every week you spend from 2:00 to 5:00 in the lab. In reality, this is more likely to be 1:45 to 5:00. On average, you are spending 3 hours in the lab. There were ten labs this semester. Simple multiplication: 30+ hours a semester in the lab. Initially this seems innocuous, even like a small amount. But then break it down. Those are 30+ hours of your life that you will stand in a dry room, stirring, pouring, and waiting, utterly unstimulated. Now take into account the lab reports. To be very generous, let's say that these are about 10 pages long. Google tells me it takes approximately 45 minutes to write a page. So then 450 minutes per lab report, 4500 minutes for the semester, that's 75 hours. Now we're looking at 105+ hours for the semester. Adding on pre-lab lecture, this comes out to about 115+ hours, excluding any personal time you wish to take to study. This is a significant time commitment for a 1/2 credit. I leave it up to your discretion whether you believe that this is worth it. \r\n\r\nI mentioned outside studying. There will be times when you need to learn material outside of lab in order to perform well on the quiz. For the final, you will be expected to memorize random details from your labs throughout the semester and regurgitate them. By random details, I mean mole ratios and the formulas of obscure molecules that you then need to balance. \r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, it's not \"that bad.\" The class is perfectly doable. You might even find solace in the camaraderie between classmates, or fun in trading jokes with your TAs or Dr. G. However, Yale is expensive. If you were to take five classes a semester each semester (as of 2018, tuition is $53,430 excluding room and board), then each class you take will coast about $1335.75. That same money could get you a new laptop, phone, 2 tickets to a 3-day astronaut simulation, 267 five-dollar coffees, etc. My point is that we are at an incredible, life-changing institution that affords us boundless opportunities everyday, so why spend so much time doing something that you do not find interesting or fulfilling? One thousand dollars can get you a lot. Don't waste it on this class. ",

            "\u00a0No, but its the only option for most STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to another student because it is tedious and I don't feel like I learned that much at all in terms of chemistry, only doing little tasks in the lab. The hours are terrible, the grading takes forever, and Dr. G isn't a good instructor at all. The only reason I took chem lab was to fill a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to familiarize yourself with lab equipment and procedures. Dr G is very knowledgable and willing to help at any moment. ",
            "\u00a0NO, DO NOT TAKE IT! Take it in the summer with a decent professor!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it. It's required if you want to be pre-med. ",
            "\u00a0If your major does not require this course, I would consider taking it only if you are very interested in chemistry or are thinking about doing chemistry or biology research. With that said, if you pay attention and work hard in the lab, it really isn't too bad. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if its required. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they were interested in chemistry. I would not recommend it to someone who was looking for a laid back class and wasn't planning on pursuing something in which they needed these skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would say they shouldn't take it unless required for a prospective major. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you have to take it. It provides some useful knowledge for anyone who intends to continue in biology or chemistry, but it is not in itself a particularly interesting or enjoyable class. It helps explain some of the concepts that are important in general chemistry but is not fulfilling on its own. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this class unless you needed it for your major/pre-med. The grading is pretty subjective, the lab reports are lengthy, and 4-hour labs are generally not the best way to spend your afternoons. However, I would say that this class is better than Gen Chem Lab I. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is required for premed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course so that they get a foundational chemical knowledge that they can apply in the laboratory setting. ",
