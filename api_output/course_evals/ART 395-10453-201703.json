            "\u00a0The course is set up to allow art majors to practice being \"artists,\" this includes readings and discussions about how to view and talk about art, how to write artist statements, and emulate other artists. ",
            "\u00a0A stronger understanding of the process of artistic feedback and the nature of critique. ",
            "\u00a0This class developed my ability to critically consider and evaluate art, both my own and that of others. I was exposed to a variety of artists and their work and also got the chance to interact with students from other artistic disciplines than my own. "

        [
            "\u00a0It's good to have all of the juniors in the art major in a seminar together and Weinberg asks the right questions to facilitate conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't think the course gave very much incentive or motivation do put a lot of effort into each assignment. The class is structured for art students, but half of the class was design students. It had a weird dynamic. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussions were very interesting but I wished there was more time spent on actual discussion (not lecturing). ",
            "\u00a0Debate and seminar driven, but occasionally too decentralized. ",
            "\u00a0This course forced me to think critically about my own work and the future/direction of my practice. It definitely does a good job of developing a student's ability to think critically about art. It also exposes students to other students from variety of disciplines (painting, sculpture, graphic design, etc.), and was especially helpful for getting the computing and the arts majors to interact with/get to know the art majors. I really enjoyed the fact that the course involved so much interactive discussion.\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of this course were the small projects that we did, such as the reimagining of the David Wojnarowicz piece. I wish that we had incorporated more small projects like this into the curriculum, as I think being pushed to interact with subjects/mediums that we may not usually was a good creative exercise, and helpful to the overall purpose of the course.

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to any non-majors. This course is only meant for art majors and computing and the arts majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Must take for art majors ",
            "\u00a0This course is a requirement for the art major, and I don't believe non-art majors typically take the course so this is not as much of a recommendation as a commentary. This was a great course if you take the time to put the work into doing the final project well and completing the reading assignments. Otherwise, it is easy to get through but you will not get much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Required for art majors, but still a valuable way to understand and interpret artistic criticisms and understand discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It is an excellent chance to interact with and get to know the other students in the art/computing and the arts majors. Moreover, it engenders a good deal of personal and artistic growth with a relatively light work load (comparative to other Yale courses), which makes it a worthwhile course, especially during a somewhat hectic semester.
