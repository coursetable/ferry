            "\u00a0My essay writing improved significantly. This meant improving my close reading and annotating skills, as well as my general engagement with the texts, improving my structuring of my essays, and even improving the process by which I write my essays. I learned to write more clearly and concisely and to make my points with greater clarity, particularly when it came to philosophical jargon or terms peculiar to an author. My participation in class also improved in that it became a lot more grounded in the text; I learned to instinctively search for a passage whenever a classmate had a question. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading of philosophy, closely working through and interpreting an argument, crafting thoughtful criticisms of arguments ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to think critically and philosophically. It also greatly helped me improve my writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed writing and critical thinking skills by taking this course. Professor Fine has given detailed and constructive feedback on our papers (comments on ways to improve introduction and structure of the essay were especially helpful), and have also given us assignments to work on editing and rewriting passages from previous papers. The assignments and office hours proved to be very helpful in helping me develop these skills.\r\nI have also learned about important philosophers and their arguments. This course has also helped me develop relevant skills and methods in philosophical critique and close reading. The philosophical knowledge that I learned from this course and the skills I developed along the way has also encouraged me to consider continuing taking more courses in philosophy in subsequent years. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills; I learned an overview knowledge of Western philosophy since 1500. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking regarding knowledge itself; how to build a cohesive and concise argument in my papers; general understanding of modern philosophy that has led to my own reimagining of my purpose in life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to approach philosophy in both text and idea form -- something I have no experience with. I learned how to shape my reading of these long texts into specific questions and connections with other texts, and how to identify holes in arguments that are buried. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are too many to count. The course could be improved by making our readings shorter and more manageable (although our professor helped with this). ",
            "\u00a0Too much reading at times to read thoughtfully, but a really great introduction to philosophical thought and writing (Murdoch and de Beauvoir each need two sections, Berkeley maybe could be less) ",
            "\u00a0I think that a strength of this course is how much you cover. That same strength, however, is also a weakness because we had to squeeze in the only two women philosophers into one week while we gave Immanuel Kant alone 3 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was very good. I appreciated the small seminars and emphasis on building writing skills. This works well with the current 10-12 person class size with 3 essays. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very rigorous, which comes with benefits and weaknesses. The final exam portion is the most worthy of criticism, as any quote based examination is asymmetric with the rest of what DS is about and should be reexamined. For instance, the final could consist of more essay questions or there could be a final essay for each DS course rather than a strangely formatted final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: every student (and professor) was passionate about what we were reading and it really showed, the books were super cool, and the lectures gave overall insights that drastically helped in understanding some of the obscure arguments\r\nWeaknesses: very high expectations for very little time to complete assignments "

            "\u00a0Yes, given that they are interested in philosophy; it is an extremely rigorous but extremely rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course has changed not only how I view the relationship between the world and philosophy, but how I should critically assess the nature of a subject as well. ",
            "\u00a0YES - so engaging and really well connected with all of DS ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend. This course has given me an interesting and impressive introduction to modern philosophy and has also encouraged me to pursue my study in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a part of DS as a whole. Without the rest of the context of DS, I'm not sure I would take it it overlooks too much important stuff if not supplemented by H/P. Luckily, if you're doing DS, you have to take both, so I had a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Directed Studies to students who are invested in a multidisciplinary approach to the western canon, but perhaps not to those who are only interested in one of the subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, because it truly opened up a love of philosophy that was dormant in me all throughout high school, when there was no outlet. I learned how to think critically about simply the objects around me, what I take to be true, and what a human self can conceive of. I had so much fun in class every day, and genuinely was excited to go. "
