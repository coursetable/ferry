            "\u00a0This class is unique in that it introduces a completely new way of looking at biology processes. Would love for there to be more classes about biophysics! ",
            "\u00a0It was a good course. I learned a lot about stochastic processes that govern biological phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of important statistics and modeling techniques. This class was very computation heavy, and we were free to use Matlab or Mathematica, so having prior knowledge is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how one can mathematically model a wide range of biological phenomena. I also learned how to simulate stochastic equations, which was both fun and a useful skill to have. ",
            "\u00a0A more quantitative approach to certain biological phenomena such as diffusion, actin polymerization, blood flow, and regulated and non-regulated forms of DNA transcription. Unfortunately, not as much \"physics\" as I would have liked, more like statistics in a way. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a limited introduction to several topics in biophysics. It gave a sense to how physics can be used to describe several biological phenomena, but not in much depth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a lot in this course about how real physics can be applied to biology. I loved that there was a different topic every other week or so because it provided more insight on what type of work exactly that a biophysicist might do and what types of problems they might be working on. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: collaboration with other students, diversity of students (gender, grad school vs college, race), approachability of the professor\r\n- the class was structured in a wall that fosters learning while decreasing stress (challenging psets but doable exams with exam corrections)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the time of the class (right after lunch) ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the content very much! Definitely more focused on the physics and math than bio, but the context of the Psets was with basic biology, so it was nice to see some applications. The Psets were extremely time consuming and often difficult, but Prof Mochrie is a gem and is very willing to help. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized. Like many classes, an outline for the class was given at the beginning of the semester. Unlike many classes, we stuck to the curriculum and shifts from topic to topic were well punctuated. As such, I never had any doubt about what I was learning. Also, learning the Gillespie algorithm in a context that didn't require any coding background was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mochrie was always willing to help and a great resource, but I think the class could've been better by choosing a TA who had previously taken the course or simply just having an undergraduate peer tutor who has taken the course. Our TA was very friendly and willing to help, but it was clear that biological physics wasn't exactly has area of expertise, so sometimes it felt as though we were kind of flailing through the content alongside him rather than him actually helping us. The other thing is I really hope that Professor Mochrie types up ALL of his notes in the future. There was a chunk of a few lectures (not many, maybe just 4) where the notes were genuinely unreadable (since they were handwritten). As someone who struggles to keep up during class and therefore has to reference the notes after class every week on my own, those couple lectures kinda wrecked me (I don't know that I will ever really understand how to use a generating function or what it does). The final thing I hope Professor Mochrie does is really take the time to go through each and think through whether he is being sufficiently detailed with his explanations. Often times, class just felt like copying down notes I didn't really understand because he would either skip steps or simply write down equations without explaining where they came from. This does real harm to the quality of learning students get out of the class, since some of the content, while very important, does not appear on the psets/exams so then students feel like they can get away with not really learning it at all (like, as previously mentioned, the generating functions!). All in all though, a decent class with a really caring, fun professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be a lot more interesting if it required a higher level of physics background and concentrated on only a few topics in detail. The problem sets weren't incredibly difficult but tended to be quite long and repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is the best course Ive taken at Yale so far. Some people might not enjoy the lectures all that much, but I thought they were fun. The study sessions are definitely the best place to go to get help and I feel the course is structured really well, especially grade-wise to encourage learning. There is no competitive curve. Homework is 40% of the grade and you can do corrections on tests for up to 40% of the points back. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in biophysics. It's a very cool class that gives an overview of how physics can be and has been applied to biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you took 260 and don't want to take 261, this is a nice alternative. I would recommend it but be prepared to put a lot of time into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend taking Biological Physics with Prof. Mochrie! The material was not too difficult to pick up with a physics background, and Mochrie clearly does not care about drilling the nitty-gritty of the biology that we learned. For example, he often didn't remember the names of basic terms from biology such as meiosis, even while discussing models on that very topic. I suspect he did this as a joke, but either way it set the tone, and made it clear we didn't have to memorize annoying terminology. Overall, I think we covered some truly remarkable models of biological systems. The fact that these systems can be modeled at all is somewhat surprising, and then the fact that, often times, the results are relatively clean is even more mind-blowing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Its a really great course for discovering what a biophysics career could look like and for learning some practical applications of physics for biology if you decide you want to biology research in the future. "
