            "\u00a0I learned to examine poetry carefully on a line-by-line basis and to trace the trajectory of English poetry in terms of influences on the canon. I also learned to discuss the canon more generally, and the place of specific works within it. ",
            "\u00a0I sharpened my inclination to understand a work in both its literary and historical connections to other works surrounding it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the later half of english poetry ",
            "\u00a0A great class that really expanded my knowledge of the poetic cannon. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to close reading a poem, I learned about various poetic traditions and forms, and was able to read some of the best poetry written in the English language. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Easily accessible to students who havent really studied poetry before. A lot of the readings are dense though so its not for everyone ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course is at its best when instructors are able to choose the poets that they are teaching -- I found that it was rather easy to tell when we were reading a Yale-mandated poet versus a poet Prof. Levine had chosen, as class discussions regarding the poets Prof. Levine chose were always more interesting/seemed more relevant to questions of canon, etc. That said, I do understand the format of the course. I think it was helpful that we were reading poets in order and examining all their works at one time as opposed to breaking them up through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Class was often very structured, organized, and directed by its historical and contextual introduction. The assignments were always given with sufficient time to contemplate and complete. The readings were very manageable, and perhaps even scant, so I could see that being revised. ",
            "\u00a0The omission of Paradise lost I think helped the course, because as it formerly was the course starts off with glossing over Paradise lost as fast as possible, and now it feels more balanced and we revisited each poets works enough that I never felt like we moved on from something too soon. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class, though the students could be pushed a little harder to participate fully in the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to English poetry that does not overwhelm. The writing requirements gradually increased over the semester at a manageable pace. The readings were beautiful and Professor Levine was an excellent instructor. In terms of weaknesses, nothing really sticks out in my mind. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially with this prof ",
            "\u00a0If you're an English major, you're probably taking this course to get it over with, but I do think there's a great deal of benefit to be had. I didn't take 125, and I was coming into 126 absolutely dreading it, with little to no knowledge of poetry. That said, I feel as though I learned a lot; Prof. Levine in particular is adamant about providing context to the poems we read, and I cannot emphasize enough how helpful that is. She is also an extremely careful facilitator of discussion and I really enjoyed the poets she selected for us to read. I would recommend her section in particular -- I really enjoyed myself, and was pleasantly surprised. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The syllabus was very cohesive and engaging. The different poets came together very interestingly, and the structure of the assignments facilitated understanding of this larger picture of artists reconsidering, defying, respecting, and harmonizing with one another's thoughts and concerns. The amount of material that needed to be covered balanced well with the amount of students and their thoughts on it as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is among the intro course requirements for English majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I found it valuable and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student wanting an accessible introduction to poetry. The reading load is light but enjoyable. If you can, take the course with Professor Levine. I especially appreciated her focus on Victorian poets like Barrett Browning and Tennyson. She's also very helpful and fun to talk to in office hours. "
