            "\u00a0I learned how to use library resources and I think I improved my essay revision skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt just how much depth an exploration of the self can have through a synthesis of so many different fields I never expected to learn about, such as philosophy and neuroscience. I also learnt how to write strong academic papers without making them sound too dry, and without discarding my creativity. Although this was an English writing course, it truly showed me how such vastly different fields can intersect with each other in the realm of something as fundamental as the self. This class also helped improve my general reading and writing skills over and above those pertaining to academic papers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insight into what it means to be \"me\". I also learned about the importance of nuance in essay-writing. ",
            "\u00a0I discovered an incredible amount about my personal interests in psychology, philosophy, and writing. Now, I have been inspired to take more classes in the humanities that I hadn't considered before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different philosophies of the self through the lenses of everything ranging from Cartesian philosophy to modern concepts of artificial intelligence. Since this was also a writing course, I learned how to really expand on my claims and challenge my own ideas in my writing. I also learned about the importance of crafting an interesting argument for any given paper. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned more about creating strong academic writing, the revision process (creating drafts, editing with peers), reading and discussing philosophy, and writing creatively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write the required writing courses for an English 114 class. I also learned about the self and how to write an essay about a film. ",
            "\u00a0I developed far more in depth writing skills than I previously possessed. I now know how to better construct and defend an argument based on real sources, and I have lots of practice doing just that. \r\nI also had the opportunity to reflect on the concept of identity and existence far more in depth than I have ever done before. I'm glad to have had this setting to learn from real sources rather than just rely on my own existential ramblings. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly believe that I honed my writing, reading, and overall analytical skills. This class taught me to think very deeply and abstractly, which I think prepares me very well for the rest of my time at Yale. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought the class was fun and interesting but it did have some pitfalls. The first half or 3/4 of the class was centered on philosophy which was not very interesting. I don't think I really got much out of them and especially not from the movie. I also wish we had more classes focused on improving our writing. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths is that there is a lot of interesting material from the readings that you can draw on and the topic itself is so engaging that the prospect of writing the papers doesn't seem as daunting. The papers get progressively harder, drawing on new skills as you learn them, but the last paper is shorter and easier in some ways, which gives you some breathing room as finals approach. However, I would have liked it if the readings were a bit more evenly distributed with other fields giving us a break from philosophy once in a while. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a low workload apart from the essays, which was very good. I also enjoyed in-class discussions very much as they were very philosophical. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course came solely from the professor. He was capable of listening to his students, keeping a structured agenda, and sparking interest in every individual. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was the interesting nature of the topic. This made the readings enjoyable, the class discussion engaging, and the essays thought-provoking. One weakness of the course was the way that the writing skills were taught. In my opinion, the days when we focused on writing skills were pretty bland and not altogether too helpful if the specific topics didn't apply to you. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of ENGL114 is that the most important and work-intensive paper is assigned toward the end of the course, but not at the time of finals. It allows us to build off our skills, and feel more relaxed during finals. ",
            "\u00a0There was great feedback from the professor in the course. I just wish there was a larger Artificial Component of the course because that is what the course titled suggested. However, the focus was primarily on the self. ",
            "\u00a0Topics covered were all interesting and related well to the overall course topic. In class discussions were engaging, and assignments were productive.\r\nLength and difficulty of readings is a bit inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0I really do not believe there are any weaknesses. I thought the material was very intriguing, and that all the assignments were fair and pushed us to the best of our abilities. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think if someone likes philosophy and really wants to take an English 114 then I would recommend this course but otherwise probably not. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course for 2 reasons - the content and the instructor. The topic is super engaging for people interested in just about any field and Craig makes sure the readings are relevant but also interesting. His own insights on the readings facilitate great classroom discussion and because there is an intersection of so many fields, it allows for a variety of opinions in the room. Although the class is intended to work on your writing skills, it never feels like you are learning just the mechanics of language and without learning anything else interesting. Craig is super helpful with his feedback, really laidback, and also flexible with his deadlines. He wants your best writing with you putting time into it, not your frantic 1-hour-before-the-deadline work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was a very fun, interesting course which is a nice context in which to work on your writing. However, it is very hard to get an A in the class, even though the workload is not bad. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although ENGL 114 is so dependent on the professor. There is a generally negative stigma around this series of classes due to the discrepancies across each individual class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to others. I took it as a first-year, and it was a great way to become familiar with the college writing process.  The topic was really interesting, and the readings were enjoyable and not too lengthy for the most part. It might be worth noting that the first half (and maybe even more than half) of the course really does not focus on artificial intelligence or technology at all, but if you think you would like a brief introduction to some philosophy in an informal setting, then this course is definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend section 29 (Me, Myself(ie), and AI) to students interested in philosophy, neuroscience, or AI, and students who like to participate in seminar-style discussion or who want to learn to create stronger academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend any English 114 course to students, especially if you are a STEm major! It is worth the time and effort to improve your writing skills in a professional course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. For anyone interested in any form of writing, I would say that this course not only teaches great fundamental skills that can be applied pretty much universally, but also provides an opportunity to discuss some really cool topics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The class was very unique in its insight, while also providing a very good introduction to our future writing courses at Yale. "
