            "\u00a0We discussed power balances and dynamics, focussing on the New Haven area, but also expanding it to the nation/globe when relevant. We had lots of guest speakers, who were all incredible community organisers, and took lots of field trips. The course was fabulous. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the history of community organizing and the different ways activists have worked against institutional powers to create real and positive change. Learned how to think critically about institutions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ways in which cities are constructed socially, physically, and politically to benefit certain people and silence others. And I learned about the tactics people use to organize collective action to fight for justice and voice. ",
            "\u00a0Organizing theories fluency, comfort discussing complex political matters ",
            "\u00a0How to organize, why to organize. I learned a new way of thinking about power tied to material conditions and immediate political goals. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about New Haven; power dynamics within urban areas; and how organising, activism works to combat these dynamics. I enjoyed the skill of pursuing personal research ",
            "\u00a0We talked about various issues relating to activism in New Haven "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think the readings were a bit on the high end, but we did discuss this with Prof. Crumlish and he was very reasonable about it. Otherwise, the course was excellent  the discussions were engaging and everyone brought such incredibly unique insights to the table. ",
            "\u00a0Heavy reading, could be lighter. Great discussions and great site visits. ",
            "\u00a0The course was too lecture heavy at the beginning and based on somewhat poorly defined projects. For the most part, as people defined their projects and got comfortable taking ownership of the classroom, the course improved exponentially. Perhaps the beginning was intentionally frustrating, but I think we could've engaged more dynamically with the readings from early on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Crumlish is great and the class dynamic was too. great readings and interesting assignments ",
            "\u00a0The course engages with a set of diverse questions and interesting reading materials. However, I wish we had discussed more about Prof. Crumlish's own background in terms of community engagement and social justice. ",
            "\u00a0There definitely needs to be more structure for the final project. We kinda got to the last few weeks of the course and were like final wut..? But I think Prof Crumlish got this and will try to structure it better in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be much more focused on reading the work of organizers of color/female organizers. The class was way more urban studies focus than I expected and I don't think I learned very much about how to actually organize which was very disappointing. Class discussion/engagement could have been a lot better. ",
            "\u00a0Allowing more time to read books would have helped deepen the discussion. Also, providing specific chapters to read would have been helpful. Walking tours were very good, as well community visits. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fieldtrips, interviews and activities with New Haveners. The way we could pursue personal interests and listen to the personal interests of other students. \r\n\r\nWeakness: A slight lack of class structure. Too many readings and sometimes we never discussed whole books that we had to read, so maybe directed reading is better. Also slight lack of clarity on assignments from Crumlish. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely the visitors we had, even though there were only two and they came at the end of the semester. Listening to our visitors was really interesting and eye opening. The weakness was class otherwise. The reading seemed sort of irrelevant, and hard to complete, being a book per week. More directly related hands on activities about New Haven would've made this a better class. "

            "\u00a0YES!! if you're interested in New Haven, or how power structures form, or how people organise into protest movements -- 100% apply to this. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely  I learned so much and got a newfound appreciation for organizing and also made great relationships with my peers. ",
            "\u00a0The students really made the class, and it was an excellent place to think critically about the role Yale plays in New Haven and how we should think of ourselves as part of that system. I would absolutely recommend the class to students who haven't gotten to think about that much or who are interested in refining their understanding of Yale in New Haven and their role as student-activists. Also a cool class if you're interested in the history of New Haven! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale! This class is really interesting for anyone interested in urban planning/urban studies, organizing, city development, learning more about New Haven and discussing the Yale/New Haven relationship, take this course. I especially loved all of the guests visits with New Haven organizers and the emphasis placed on student-led discussion during class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with some reservations. The reading load is heavy. You can get away with not doing it but you wont learn as much. I think Prof Crumlish might be reducing the readings in the future tho, so ask about that. ",
            "\u00a0I don't feel like I learned a ton from this class. Take it if you are interested in cities and city planning but not necessarily if you want to learn about on the ground organizing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! there are few like it. Professor Crumlish is a very different kind of Yale professor. Will give you a good idea of how to change power from existing institutions. ",
            "\u00a0Learning about New Haven should be essential and there are very few classes to do that! A lot of important aspects of urban life, from space to government to community organisations, are discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe, if you're really passionate about activismthis is a great course for activists. But otherwise, it may be boring for you and you will receive very little feedback on your essays. "
