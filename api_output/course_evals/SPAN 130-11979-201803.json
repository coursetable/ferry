            "\u00a0It's a continuation of Spanish II. I like that the curriculum goes over what we learned in L1 and L2 and builds upon it rather than just throwing new material at you. Overall its a decent course if you are interested in the Spanish language. For those who aren't, however, or just taking it for a requirement this course, like most language courses, can feel like a bit of a slog with a never ending todo list of activities and time consuming memorization. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course is the same as any Spanish Course: the Spanish language department. I have found the department to be less than useful throughout my time here at Yale. They tend to be very obstructionist and unwilling to work with you. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course has good material to make you learn the language and understand it thoroughly, but I think the examinations could be spaced out better. For a while it was like we had something every few days, but then sometimes we wouldn't have much for a bit, so more balance would be preferable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that more emphasis could be placed on speaking, even if it's often the last thing that students want to do because that's really important in learning a language. the variance in activities, reading stories, etc was good ",
            "\u00a0It's too focused on the textbook.  The worksheets feel a bit petty and narrow, and don't promote actual conversation. ",
            "\u00a0My teacher was amazing and made class so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a pretty good system of teaching Spanish fundamentals,  but sometimes the grammar is harder to use naturally without a lot of outside practice and exposure because it's learned in such a linear way. The readings and films definitely help out, but more exposure to especially auditory Spanish spoken between people outside a classroom context may also help improve confidence with speaking in class. Also, the homework load should be way more balanced because sometimes it's just Supersite or maybe 15-30 min of work, and other days there's longer readings coupled with other stuff that falls on nights students might also have other things to do. Besides that though L3 is a pretty good course. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments and expectations were fairly straightforward. With all of the textbook work and VHL assignments, it kind of felt like a high school Spanish class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, very helpful if you want to learn a foreign language. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course that requires a lot of partner and group work and conversations, but the homework is mostly quick to do. "
