            "\u00a0In this course I learned a highly mathematical approach to modeling vascular mechanics in a manner which could be readily translated to a computational modeling platform. ",
            "\u00a0A very interesting and engaging look at the biomechanics (and mechanobiology!) of the human vascular system.  I learned how to apply principles from classical mechanics and fluid mechanics to a biological system, which encompasses exactly what I want to learn as a biomedical engineering major. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie primarily in the instructor, who is clearly an expert in this field and demonstrates compassion when teaching to the class and in responses to questions. \r\n\r\nI would say the weaknesses of the course are that it seems to be presented in quite an abstract fashion. Particularly for students in the course not well versed in principles of engineering it was often both difficult to keep up and relate what we were learning directly to the biology. Though, I of course acknowledge this is a senior level biomedical engineering course at Yale, and the professor should rightly take prerequisite engineering courses somewhat for granted. Additionally, there was ample support outside of class time for students to catch up in they felt behind. \r\n\r\nI would say it is reasonably clear that Dr. Humphrey recognizes this issue as nearer to the end of the course and briefly during the middle there were some lectures devoted to the biology. However, I would add that the level of difficulty of engineering material is far and above that presented from a biological standpoint. Perhaps it is not the intent of the course, but I would have found a heavier focus on advanced biology commensurate to the math informative and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly engaging, best class I've taken this semester.  I love classes that take one problem and dive deeply into it from multiple angles, and this is definitely one of those classes.  A great balance between physics/math derivations of biomechanical problems, and biology/pathology of the vascular system in general.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very challenging and math-heavy.  The class is full of grad students from Humphrey's lab which is a little intimidating, but it's also an honor to learn surrounded by so many experts and at such a high level, so I guess it's also a strength.  Especially since Prof Humphrey and Jason were happy to help us work through the material. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the math behind the biology. This course is math and engineering heavy, but it an extremely engaging and interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0Take anything taught by Jay Humphrey!  One of the best professors I've ever had at Yale, if not the best.  He will explain the most elaborate concepts (about which he has written textbooks) in the most elegant and engaging ways.   This class is tough especially if you are an undergrad and especially if you are not as strong in your math/physics skills, but it's definitely doable and the challenge is not only worth it, but super rewarding.
