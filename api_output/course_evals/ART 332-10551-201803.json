            "\u00a0Learned new ways to apply oil paint, think about composition in new ways, deal with painting in short periods of time. ",
            "\u00a0Painting outdoors ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to paint with oils - i've never done that before and the professor was super helpful. I also did a lot of plein air painting and got better at it. ",
            "\u00a0Greater knowledge of tools to create space in painting ",
            "\u00a0How to paint from life rather than a photograph. ",
            "\u00a0-Painting backgrounds and from real life ",
            "\u00a0I just got an invaluable blocked out time each week to paint and work which is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different techniques in painting: using oil, palette knife, tempera, oil ground, etc. Other than techniques - to read about artists and look up their work; to research how others approached the subject I wanted to explore. Also, how to accept critique to grow. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to incorporate different mediums for my oils paints as well as how to experiment with laying down different grounds for my paintings. The course helped me adapt to passage of time and improve my observational skills ",
            "\u00a0This was a really great course that taught you all about landscape painting and observational painting. Although the main focus is put on portraying the natural world through oil painting, there is definitely room to incorporate using watercolors and the human figure during this course. Samuel Messer is a great teacher and genuinely wants to help you improve your painting. This class really helped me develop confidence in oil painting and my own style as well. I love oil painting even more after taking this class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Freedom to paint two times a week! I would have liked more guidance throughout the time we spent in class though ",
            "\u00a0The class is overall really great. You learn some new techniques (oil paint, egg tempera, using a palette knife) but you're given a lot of space to experiment on your own. Carrying the giant easel around campus got a little annoying (especially in the cold) but otherwise it's good. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course. Perhaps one more larger assignment to be carried long term ",
            "\u00a0Strength: it is fun\r\nWeakness: it's meant to be until 7:20pm on Tuesdays, but often it would get dark before then so we stop painting. I didn't really mind ",
            "\u00a0-Samuel Messer is a fantastic teacher with a vast knowledge on art history, techniques, and everything in general. His advice was always helpful and kind, and pushed his students whenever he could. The course was solely focused on practicing your painting skills, which I really loved. I wish more classes were like this one. \r\n\r\n-One of the weaknesses of this course is honestly the cost of the materials. The amount of canvases, brushes, and paint we needed to buy was very expensive. Hopefully this can be subsidized in future years. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course achieves its goals. Maybe there could be more focus on doing larger projects? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of opportunities to experiment and learn. Professor and TA are great sources of information and willing to help.\r\nWeaknesses: learning can largely be self-driven (not necessarily a bad thing..) and sometimes in order to receive feedback you have to actively seek it. Wasn't really sure how I was doing in the class at times because of the lack of evaluation, other than the midterm review and final review. ",
            "\u00a0I extremely enjoyed going to different places every week to paint in a new environment as well as the demonstrations. I wish that there were more one-on-one instruction while painting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the professor and the fact that most of the painting is completed during class time. Samuel messer also goes to great effort to organize interesting environments and subjects for you to paint such as rare birds in the Peabody museum. If you are not an artist who likes using oil paint or painting for hours outside the studio every week, then I would not reccomend this class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! So fun--it isn't a class where you spend time to learn techniques in the studio, but we all definitely grew as artists in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you just want to spend some time to develop your painting skills! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants a relatively low workload class to learn some new techniques and hone their painting skills. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class as it stands out from others at Yale in teaching style etc ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to be a better painter. Sam is an excellent teacher ",
            "\u00a0If you have previous painting experience, you must absolutely take this course. It's one of the best at Yale for art students.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the exercises we do during class are quite difficult and overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Ya if you love to paint this is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course for art majors and non-art majors. In painting from life I think you learn a lot about what sort of composition and style you learn forward, and the task becomes how to push forward from what you're comfortable with. Because we make at least one painting per week there's a lot of room to experiment. Observational painting doesn't have to be boring or flat, I think it's a chance to try new styles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was excellent in improving my painting skills as well as being able to provide experiences that can not be achieved nowhere else on campus (such as going to the morgue, the Peabody museum inventory, the Payne Whitney pool). "
