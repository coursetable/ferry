            "\u00a0The reading passages were very engaging. It was useful that we spent time in class going through each translation sentence by sentence. I thought the strength of the course was the attention to language in the translations. The instructor was also extremely helpful in office hours. The course was thoughtfully designed and assignments were interesting and valuable. I think perhaps the coverage of grammatical rules in class could have followed a clearer structure. It did not always feel that class related closely to the textbook readings. I would have felt more engaged had there been a closer correlation. ",
