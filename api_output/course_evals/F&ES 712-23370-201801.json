            "\u00a0I have not only increased knowledge of the science, policy, and management practices around water in the US and internationally, but also improved my systems thinking. This course engaged interdisciplinary thinking and professional skills in a way that was interesting, engaging, and meaningful. I want to take it again and again!! ",
            "\u00a0Extensive overview of the history and current status of water resource topics and challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I got an introductory understanding of many key water related issues across sectors. ",
            "\u00a0Very valuable knowledge on water resources ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a variety of different aspects of water management, from the more technical and scientific to the social and political. We explored several themes that framed the course, for example the hard vs soft path for water management. I also gained experience in writing a case study of a particular issue with constructive feedback from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broader knowledge of water management issues, adding to my relatively narrow expertise. I appreciated learning about a variety of solutions that can be applied to different problems in different ways, with the understanding that the same solution will not work every time. ",
            "\u00a0Water resource management, water quality, water use and allocation policy ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive view of water management across a variety of domestic and international contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This course approached water issues from a wide variety of perspectives and lenses, most of which I hadn't previously considered. I feel like I can go into the world and work with water with a much deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding water and society. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of different aspects of water resources management. I'm confident that I'm now competent in learning additional knowledge and skills on the job around any of the topics covered in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar-style in which this course was designed and carried out, helped me draw from previous courses and professional experience to provide solutions to real-world problems. I really enjoyed the case studies presented in class -from U.S. and also from other countries around the world- as well as Shimi's extraordinary guidance and passion for the subject of water management. \r\nThis course gave me a perfect balance of social and scientific tools to better manage water in times of scarcity, as well as in times in abundance and even in conflict. \r\nBy looking at current U.S. water-related laws and several international projects concerning water management made me realize the importance of working collaboratively to understand and then to propose solutions. A very clear takeaway from this course is the need to implement several methodologies and techniques to cope with the seasonality and variability of water, especially in the era of climate change. "

            "\u00a0My expectations were far exceeded, particularly the expectations I had for the project/paper portion of the course, which I gained much more from than I anticipated. Synthesizing the multi-faceted topic from the many angles we were introduced to through the class and conducting research that included engaging with relevant stakeholders was rewarding and demonstrated that gaining expertise and playing an important role is these types of issues is rewarding and purposeful. ",

            "\u00a0The fact that this course is considered a middle-level applied course, really fulfilled my expectations, due to the content related to present and actual problems in the world of water. \r\nWith the help of the Teacher assistant and with Shimi's guidance on the final paper, the class learning were robust and very comprehensive, starting from a very theoretical background of water measurement to specific examples were management of water has been successful, and those that failed.

            "\u00a0I think the course is very well done. Shimi has clearly put a lot of thought into crafting each topic area. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how the class was separated into topic area, so that each seminar could focus in depth on specific issues. It was engaging and called for participation, so I got to learn a lot from my classmates as well. The schedule made the class feel a bit choppy at times because we missed a number of classes for spring break, and some unexpected reasons (illness, travel, school-wide events). Since it is likely moving to a twice a week class, it will be easier to form a sense of continuity. Also, with shorter class sessions, perhaps watching the films on your own time and devoting the class schedule to discussion/lecturing would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Good class overall ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured. The quizzes and homework assignments reinforce material in a helpful way and the case study project enables students to delve deeper into the content as it relates to a specific location. I really liked the guest lectures, especially for the Indian water settlements and WASH classes. The field trips are also great. The only suggestion I have for improving the course is to provide clearer guidance on what students should include or focus on in the reading responses. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The field trips, visiting lecturers, and group discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course meeting time was entirely too long and should be split between two days. I became disengaged after 2 hours in class, and often struggled through the last hour. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course is also its strength--the lectures, field trips, and other content are all great, but there's isn't enough time to cover everything in the depth it deserves, even with nearly 4 hours of class per week. Shimi is a great lecturer and very receptive to answering student questions and fostering discussion...but there just wasn't enough time to discuss everything! With the format changing to 3 credits for next year, is it possble to turn this into 2 semesters of 3 credit classes? ",
            "\u00a0Strength: 1. Shimi's lectures are very clear and well-structured. 2. The field trips were great learning experiences.\r\nWeakness: writing the term paper with a partner who didn't seem to care as much about the topic as I did was very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Although I was aware from the beginning that the content had mostly domestic examples -from the U.S.- , I would recommend to enrich its content by the additions of previous-years student projects into the curriculum of the course\r\n\r\nA definitive strength of this class is the wide-range of educational tools that it provides, ranging from field visits, to readings, discussions, formal presentation of a topic and the delivery of a high-quality final paper.

Anyone interested in water, agriculture, energy, climate change, indigenous rights, and/or urban planning should definitely take this class.

            "\u00a0Since it is a 4-credit course it involves a lot of work. Do not take this class along with other high-reading-demanding classes and/or other 4-credit courses. On the other hand, the discussions are very rich, and depending on the level of engagement of other students, the weekly discussions and final project can provide an invaluable insight to water management around the world.
