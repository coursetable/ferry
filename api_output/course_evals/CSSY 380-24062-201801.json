            "\u00a0I learned how to approach looking at legal trials in the context of time and place, among many other skills! ",
            "\u00a0I learned loads about trials that I've heard of but never had the chance to actually study and learn about. I learned how to asses trials and look at things beyond the facts of the case that may have influenced how trials turned out. ",
            "\u00a0This course will develop your critical thinking about the American judicial system. It looks at every case from several different perspectives, which gives you a broad understanding of legal processes. ",
            "\u00a0This class took an in-depth look at landmark cases in American history. We didn't just read the highlights, we discussed historical context, and the legal, political and public variables that affect the case before and after. ",
            "\u00a0I had very little knowledge of the judicial system before the course, but I appreciated that Professor Ford didn't really expect any prior understanding. He preempted questions by explaining intricate themes of that class from the get-go and was always receptive to discussing what we were confused about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about each case we covered and learned how to ask the right questions to understand the circumstances at hand- the time and place. I found the hypothetical scenarios intellectually and ethically challenging in the best way possible and also very relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The course was especially helpful in learning how to contextualize historical time and place into legal and moral arguments. I really enjoyed thinking through all of these cases. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Its a long seminar. 2 full hours. And Prof Ford does a lot of off-topic talking sometimes which makes it hard to stay focused. But when the class is all communicating and participating or when Prof Ford is talking about all of his experiences, its super cool. He knows SO much which is a huge strength. The final paper is longer than necessary though: 15-20 pages, which usually isn't bad, but for the prompt it really should be a 10-12 or 12-15 page paper. ",
            "\u00a0It is a really great all around course. It creates awesome discussions surrounding hypothetical situations. ",
            "\u00a0In the class, Jack actively encourages students to supply both sides of an argument, regardless of your personal viewpoint - which is lacking in many Yale classrooms. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely amazing in how Professor Ford sets up the class and the whole discussion regarding each case. Nothing negative to say at all. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is currently thematic, but I think it wouldve been easier to talk about historical context/trace those themes if it was more chronological ",
            "\u00a0I loved the videos that we watched for homework, and I found the assessments to be very reasonable. I was a little confused, however, about the organization of the course. I would have preferred to track cases by time rather than by theme, as we never really connected the themes from one week to the next. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent as it is. One of my favorites at Yale. "

            "\u00a0A fantastic capstone course to a Yale college career. Jack Ford is wonderful, and getting the chance to listen to him every week was the highlight. ",
            "\u00a0YES it's a Yale must-take. Prof. Ford is insanely knowledgeable and seminar is extremely engaging and interesting. I looked forward to coming every week. ",
            "\u00a0Abso-freaking-lutely. This class is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale and was the perfect ending to my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0You must take this class if you can get in. Truly fun material with an incredibly engaging professor who has some pretty awesome stories to boot. Best senior spring class ever. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn more about the most important trials in American history in the last century. The homeworkreadings and videosthat was assigned was a joy to complete, and I feel like a gained crucial knowledge of some of the cases that were hugely significant in American culture. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, my favorite course I have taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a great course if you're interested in landmark cases and want to learn a new way to look at them. It's also not too difficult, which can be great for second semester seniors. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS - BY FAR THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE! If you get in, this class is a wonderful experience and you will enjoy every part of it. Professor Ford is incredible and extremely knowledgeable so his anecdotes are so cool to hear and his experiences overall with each case are unparalleled. Each class is more lecture style than discussion but each discussion is thought provoking and adds to the class. Midterm and Final are truly enjoyable to do and are not meant to trick you up. Take this class, trust me you won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an entertaining and informative senior seminar class. Professor Ford is very knowledgeable and engaging and really makes the class. I would recommend to a fellow student as a fun senior spring experience. ",
            "\u00a0The cases we studied were fascinating. As a STEM major, I found the course very accessible and I also learned a lot. The discussions are very directed, but I really liked that, because we got to explore the most interesting topics in depth without wasting time with a meandering discussion. The professor was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Trials of the Century was one of my favorite courses ever, and Professor Ford is so fun! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you can take this course before you graduate, definitely do. "
