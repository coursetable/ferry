I also learned a lot about using radio data which I had never worked with before. ",

I also liked the weekly paper reviews because they were often related to topics we discussed that week in lecture so it helped to be able to learn those concepts in class but then learn how they have been applied to current research in the field. ",

Radio astronomy part and handling of data might be difficult for the first-timers. My suggestion is to give them suggested reading and resources to prepare them before asking them to do the data questions in the homework. "
