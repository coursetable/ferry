            "\u00a0I learned the fundaments of Classical Chinese grammar and vocabulary, and acquired a plethora of strategies for interpretation and translation. Having completed this course, I feel prepared to advance to more difficult Chinese texts of a variety of genres, and have a systematic understanding of Classical Chinese grammar. ",
            "\u00a0A solid foundation in Classical Chinese grammar and 850 characters' vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to read 850 traditional Chinese characters that were relevant to different stories we read from the textbook. We started out with proverbs, but quickly branched out into various pieces of didactic literature. Through reading and translating, we were able to pick up several grammatical forms important for reading literary Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Significant insights into literary/classical Chinese. Strong translation skills, great grammatical analyses ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze ancient Chinese language and some Chinese culture and history "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was generally strong; its only deficit was the grading scale of its quizzes, which I would have preferred to be graded on a 1-40 scale rather than a 1-20 scale. This might have allowed for more nuance in the comments on our work, while cutting the students a little slack. Beyond this point, however, the course was excellent in all aspects of its design. ",
            "\u00a0The progression of the course is fast yet consistent--very effective in this sense. In-class time is used effectively to work through nuances in grammar and vocab. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-organized. We spent the first several weeks acquiring a grounding in grammar and then shifted to focus on translating longer texts. The weekly quizzes were tough at times but very fair, and preparing for them really solidified my knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary we were studying. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the current seminar size of this class and the participation of everyone had been great. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend that students interested in studying Chinese literature or any aspect of premodern Chinese history take this course as soon as possible. ",
            "\u00a0This language is unlike any other; it is a unique challenge and I recommend to all interested in reading premodern texts--East Asia has some of the most diverse and interesting sources, especially ancient. The course also provides a lot of insight into how modern Chinese came to be. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to broaden their language study, or who is interested in pursuing the Chinese canon in greater depth than the scholarship and translations available in English. You really get a greater feel for the nuances of translation when you take this course; you find out that it's no easy task at all to decide how to translate things. I wouldn't recommend it, however, without any background in modern Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a serious student of Chinese, take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the most interesting and best-taught classes I've taken at Yale so far. The texts we translated were interesting and the language was often very elegant. Learning literary Chinese also enriched my understanding of modern Mandarin. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with a background in East Asian languages. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are fluent in Chinese already because memorizing all the characters can be challenging. "
