            "\u00a0The strength of this class was Professor Hammes-Schiffer.   She was amazing and it was evident that she put thought and energy into this class.  She really seemed to care that everyone understood and gained a solid understanding of quantum computational chemistry.  The assignments for her quarter were very well organized and I learned a lot about the methods going through them.  The assignments weren't too difficult that someone with no background was lost, but also not too easy that the assignment was irrelevant.  Her material was very well organized and structured.  (My overall assessment of her section is Excellent) (This quarter was well-structured) (We promptly received our grades back)\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was Professor Jorgensen.  First, he mumbles through the entire class and so you can't understand a word he is saying.  I moved from the middle of the room towards the front to try and catch and understand what he was saying.  It didn't help that he also didn't look at us very often.  In addition, the thought that he put into the class was minimal if anything, which was very frustrating.  The lecture notes that he gave us were poorly organized and it was obviously that he thought we were all idiots.   I was excited to learn more about the water method that he developed and I am coming out of the class not knowing anything definitive about anything he taught because his mumbling, lack of organized and structured teaching, and his obvious indifference towards the class made me dread attending the class because I knew it would be a waste of an hour of my life.  In addition, our exam had no correlation to anything we learned.  There were numerous questions about statistical mechanics that he lectured on for 20 minutes one day and only one question on the material regarding drug design that he lectured on for multiple class periods.  In addition one of our questions specifically asked for the names of people who developed various methods - which is totally irrelevant.  I am leaving his quarter of the semester knowing only a handful of things:  1. He thinks that his methods are great when they aren't even used at all in the field anymore.  2. He thinks that Science and Nature papers are not relevant (except for his own publications in those journals - obviously)  3.  He thinks that he is going to be getting a Nobel Prize.  (My overall assessment of his section is Poor) (This quarter had NO structure) (We got our 2 homework grades back on the last day of class) ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have a little more structure the second half. ",
            "\u00a0The first Quantum portion of the course was very well-organized versus second portion of the course was a bit disperse: instructions for using BOSS were not clear at times . ",
            "\u00a0The first half on Gaussian was great and comprehensive. The second half on BOSS seemed useful, but could use more application-based tutorials/assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was everything organized by Dr. Hammes-Schiffer and the weaknesses were everything organized by Dr. Jorgensen. This course would be much improved if Dr. Jorgensen didn't teach it. I also was surprised that graduate students and undergraduate students did the same exact work. It was not as rigorous as a graduate course should be. If the department wants to keep it a mixed level class then the graduate students should be expected to do more. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are usually informative and friendly to those with no computational or little physical chemistry background. Problem sets and exams were disjointed, which was especially true in the second half of the course. Also, it was not easy to find help when I ran into problems on the problem sets in the second half. Josh the TA from the first half of the course is super helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the first half of the course was very well organized and clear. I wish more quantitative details had been presented, especially for the basics of Hartree-Fock approximation (why only one and two electron integrals are non vanishing etc etc)\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the course was very poorly organized and lacked any clear sense of direction or motivation for covering different topics. Some less-important topics in MD/Monte Carlo were covered in depth while extremely important ones were left out. For example, there was an entire lecture on virtual screening of small molecules, but the velocity Verlet integrator was never presented, and neither were the main thermostats.\r\n\r\nThe lectures in the first half were much more engaging than those in the second half. ",
            "\u00a0Gaussian half is great, very comprehensive and useful information. BOSS half is also quite interested but a bit less organized. "
