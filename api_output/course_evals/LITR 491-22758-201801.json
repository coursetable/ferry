            "\u00a0I felt like I was able to do research for something that I actually cared about, so it didn't feel too painful to do research/translations. I'm not particularly good at sticking to a thesis, so this challenged me to actually keep my papers from going off on tangents. ",

            "\u00a0Having us  turn in a full draft was hard in the moment but it really did make me do work early which paid off in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Excessive micro-management by the Senior Essay Coordinator. At least for the term-long Senior Essay, the minimum requirement is only 25 pages, which is barely longer than the standard 20 page research paper required for your average seminar. If you haven't learned to write a 20 page research paper by senior year, probably your senior thesis isn't going to amount to anything anyway, no matter how much administrative support you get.\r\nMore specifically: does it really make sense to require a FULL (= 25 page) draft of the essay by 6 weeks into the term?? That's not a term-long essay; that's a six-week essay. And if I were able to write a full thesis in six weeks, what would I need the rest of the term for?\r\nAlso, I think the major should encourage its students to begin the official thesis process much earlier than fall of senior year or even late-spring of junior year. In terms of finding an advisor, deciding on a topic, deciding on a specific angle of approach or research method, and maybe even beginning to research/think about your topic, I think this really needs to be finalized by early/mid Junior Spring. Otherwise, the beginning of the process senior year is too harried and cuts too much into your actual research time. "
