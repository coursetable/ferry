I also learned a lot about the Gulf Plain ecosystem, different approaches to longleaf pine forest management. It was a great experience to see how different social and economic values influenced the types of approaches used to manage these forests. ",

            "\u00a0Incredibly packed itinerary that offers students a tremendous opportunity to learn about the various aspects of southern forests. Perhaps some built-in time for rest would be helpful, but I like how full the itinerary is. ",
