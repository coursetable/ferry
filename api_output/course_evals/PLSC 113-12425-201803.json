The readings provide interesting evidence in light of some of the commonly asked questions regarding the American political system (such as \"is the American political system broken\"?). It is not just an AP Gov class; it goes far more in depth, and the lessons/reading connect to each other in really interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my skills and speed in reading very large homework assignments. Over time, I learned about which parts of the readings were essential to read, and which parts could be skimmed or skipped. \r\nI also gained insight on how the political process functions in the US today, as well as why certain institutions are structured the way they are.

I loved being introduced to game theory through public and congressional voting models.

            "\u00a0Professor Huber is an excellent lecturerenthusiastic, knowledgeable, and brilliant. The discussion sections felt less helpful/engaging. That is not a criticism of my TF, who was great. Rather, since I understood most of the lecture/reading material on my own, I did not feel the need to have the material reinforced via discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a broad overview of the essential aspects of institution structure, political bargaining and policy-making, and the role of different groups of people in politics. The lectures presented and adequate but not excessive amount of information.\r\nI did feel, however, that the assigned readings were sometimes way too big. I felt that I often could not read all the assigned material in depth if I wanted to do the homework in a reasonable amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0strengths is professor huber's way of lecturing, very engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Huber is a great lecturer. The course readings can be dense but are extremely interesting and the class as a whole is very well organized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt a little bit basic at times and started out somewhat slow. ",
            "\u00a0I would say the strengths of this course is definitely the lectures by Professor Huber. He has a way of explaining complex ideas in a detail-oriented manner. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course really stem from the readings and weekly section meetings. The assigned readings for this course can pile up quickly and be difficult to manage, but the material is beyond a superficial understanding of \"what things do\" and more of \"why do these things happen.\" Additionally, weekly section meetings brought great energy to discussing the course material and debating different interpretations and implications of course concepts. One thing that should be improved, however, is the ability to clearly comprehend the readings. As an introductory course, many students are taking this class as their first political science course and some of the readings (ex. Tocqueville), especially towards the beginning of the year, are very difficult to wrap one's head around. Moreover, many of these readings are tested on weekly quizzes when students can't even comprehend them in the first place. I'd just suggest some small tweak that allows an easier engagement and comprehension of course readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very engaging. Pretty easy to do well in if you put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0One thing that Professor Huber emphasized the first couple of classes which I think definitely held true was that this is not just AP US Government. The course focuses more on how the political systems within government work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic TF's and interesting readings. Prof Huber does a good job explaining how the system of government works.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were dry at times, and during reading week, the class was portrayed to be a lot less like U.S. Government in high school than it is. Would still recommend because it is more in depth and focuses on political science studies than U.S. Gov does, but know that this course will mirror that a little. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: manageable workload, engaging lectures\r\nweaknesses: if you don't get a good TF then section is excruciating, would've loved more real-life examples of the concepts we discussed or cases to see the mechanisms we discuss in action ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course did a nice job covering a range of important topics for students beginning to study the US government. It was structured in a way that allowed for a pretty comprehensive understanding of each topic, but I felt that it always moved onto the next topic at the appropriate time to remain engaging. I would say that the readings were for the most part pretty interesting, but I found many of them to be unnecessarily long, almost to the point that I couldn't get through them. ",
            "\u00a0Section assignments varied greatly between TA's. A more structured section system, in the sense that all sections have similar expectations, would make the course seem more fair. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings were very technical and had a lot of math/statistics ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Huber is an incredible lecturer\r\nWeaknesses - the reading check quizzes were challenging, even if you did the readings ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Huber is without a doubt one of the most knowledgeable academics in his field and his lectures provided tremendous insight into the issues that face our nation today as well as their relation to past political events. The TA's for the course, however, were, in my experience, in over their heads in terms of workload. My personal TA seemed almost obligated to be in their position and lacked a sense of commitment. ",
            "\u00a0This class discussed important issues in political both in the past and today. It was a super interesting and relevant course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course offers a very interesting view of today's politics. Other than learning how government works, you also learn why it works the way it does. ",
            "\u00a0One strength would be the open note exams. One weakness would be the slow discussions in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: lectures were very interesting, section was great, and I appreciated the option of final paper vs exam and the open note exams. \r\nWeakness: I felt like many quiz questions were a bit obscure and I still got questions wrong even after completing all the readings, which was very discouraging. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the material we were given in this class, especially the textbook, was not always reflected in the examinations. For the midterm exam, I studied more on the structure of the political system rather than the findings of the modern political system. I also felt that the examinations count too much for the overall grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, TA provided awesome feedback on both papers\r\nWeaknesses: pop quizzes were not easy even when I read the material, too many readings that werent covered in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: touches many aspects of American political system\r\nWeaknesses: the course isnt cohesive ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course was the level of organization and the way the lectures were planned out. There were no real outstanding weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings are really interesting. I especially liked how the readings came from all different time periods, some of them were even from America's founding. At times the readings can be dense, with a fair amount of empirical data. ",
            "\u00a0SO much reading - in my opinion, too much. I really wanted to enjoy and absorb the reading but didn't feel like I could because there was so much to get through that I had to rush.\r\n\r\nSuch an engaging lecturer, clear and concise slides, many different types of learning facilitated (for example, choice between final paper or exam), loved how pertinent the topic was. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include excellent lecturer and engaging presentation and relevant course readings. Improvements could be relating material to current events happening in government and to provide answers to the practice tests before mid terms. I think it would help us get a better sense of how we are doing on the practice test and make us feel more confident going into the actual test. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of different material and definitely gives students a good insight into political science research. Its main weakness, I would say, is the weekly quizzes. Oftentimes, it felt that even when students did all the readings, it was still difficult to get a good grade on these quizzes. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course; for anyone interested in American politics, this provides a very solid foundation. Professor Huber is awesome. However, be prepared for a lot of reading; usually, for each class, there is about 40 pages of textbook reading plus 1 or 2 (usually very dense) research articles. And it's hard to skip the readings and do well in the class; there are pop quizzes on the reading, and you have to do a 1-2 page \"memo\" each week (basically a summary/analysis of the readings). But, overall, it is worth it; I learned a lot about the American political system, and most people I knew seemed to do well as long as they kept up with their work. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. By the end of the course, you definitely feel like you have a better grasp over American politics and the problems in Washington today. It definitely teaches you how to be a more informed yet skeptical consumer of political information and how to analyze the media carefully. Take this course if you have the chance. ",

            "\u00a0This course resembles AP US Government, but it digresses much more into the politics of the system, and analyzes political science research. I would recommend this course to an individual who is not confident in the American political system, as well as those looking to further their understanding of the political game played between officeholders. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are interested in going into politics. I feel that it made me a more conscious voter and that I understand \"the system\" a bit better. Might not help with the requirements for the Political Science major though. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I learned a lot and I never lost interest in the class throughout the semester. ",
