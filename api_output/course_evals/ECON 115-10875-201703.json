Normally, section materials cover/prepare for the problem set at the end of the week so that you can do the problem set that weekend with advanced knowledge/practice. That extra Wednesday problem set was rough, and needed better preparation. A second weakness is discrepancy between TFs. For the final, some TFs emailed a final study guide to their section students, while others missed out completely or had to ask around to find it. Between sections and review sessions, there are some discrepancies or differences between what TFs say, making it hard for students to get exact help. ",

It is very clear that a lot of students already know a lot of this information, and I don't think that those students should be able to take this intro course. They greatly affect the grading/curve of the course in a way that often feels unfair to students who are new to this material. I often felt as though I was in a class well beyond introductory level. Despite learning a lot of new and useful material, I frequently struggled to keep up with the pace of the course. The grading of the course was subjective- particularly for problem sets. There was never any explanation for why you received a particular grade - no commentary from TA's. The expectations for assignments were unclear and the grading of psets seemed to have no structure. There was no way to ever improve performance. ",

The good thing is that so many people are in this class, that it is very easy to work with others on psets and studying. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of this course is its size. The fact that there were so many students make it difficult for the professor to attend to the needs of the individual students, so it was hard to learn during lectures. Also, since the class was so big, it was hard for the TAs to grade papers in time, so we didn't always have our problem sets back in time to study from. \r\n\r\nHowever, the material of this class is very interesting since it applies to our everyday lives, and it was interesting to draw comparisons between our lives and what happens around us. This class also extends far beyond the AP curriculum, which made it very engaging. Another strength of this course was all the staff available to help, especially the TAs and peer tutors, who had office hours every day. \r\n\r\nThis class was also organized very well. I particularly enjoyed how there were 5 semesters worth of old problem sets and old exams for us to study from, which was very helpful in providing good examples and comprehensive answers. ",

It was difficult at times to clearly listen to what Prof. Berry was saying, I wish there were captions or some way to listen to the lecture afterwards. ",

The only time we actually learned how to solve problems was in section, and lecture covered so much, so quickly that it was overwhelming and not very helpful. Very dry and not at all engaging.\r\nThis class would really be improved if it were divided into two intro micro classes: one for people who intended to major in Econ, which would basically just be Econ 115, and one for people who hoped to gain a practical understanding of the concepts of microeconomics and economic decision-making without having to do all the graphs, equations, etc. ",

Take it in the seminar format if you want to have a solid understanding of the material. Section was helpful for understanding certain concepts, but it was often hard to gain a solid grasp of concepts after listening to two mediocre lectures each week and going to a 50 minute section.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the TAs were often responsible for filling gaps in students' understanding, this class would have been a much more fulfilling experience if they knew how to teach the material better. Some TAs seemed genuinely surprised at the questions they got from students who were trying their best to understand completely new material; there seemed to be a lack of empathy among them.\r\n\r\nIn the future: offer more class tutor hours. The TAs were not very helpful with the problem sets. They could only give very vague hints about the material, which was unhelpful if the problem seemed very far removed from the material we had learned that week.

            "\u00a0This class is slightly disorganized. This is partially due to the size of the course, but this should be anticipated prior. The problem sets frequently had typos in them and had to be re-written. The problem sets were also extremely vague and unclear, causing them to be interpreted in multiple ways which proved problematic when they were graded. The problem sets were so unclear that multiple peer tutors had trouble coming to a consensus and answering them. When we received graded problem sets, they would simply put a cross through an incorrect problem without explaining what part of the problem was incorrect. The graders were sometimes quite picky with the problem sets and when I asked if I could find out what I did wrong, it proved to be very difficult as we had to track down the TA who graded it, often weeks after I had already completed the problem set. The problem sets should have been graded more promptly, especially before exams.\r\nDue to the size of the class, there were many TA sections, which differed greatly. People's experience in this class was highly dependent on the TA they had.\r\nBecause this is a recurring class, the old materials and practice exams proved to be extremely helpful, (except for the second midterm, which differed vastly from all the practice problems).

Even going to the CTL didn't guarantee much help from a TF because there were so many students. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught a lot in very little time and showed us many applications of the things we learned in order to help us understand. There isn't much weakness. Many of us were completely blindsided by the second midterm, and while the reason it was much harder made perfect sense, it felt as if we would have had a better learning experience had we known this and been able to study and prepare properly for the exam. Other than that, no problems. ",

I think it would be extremely helpful if we did the same in Econ. Many people still regularly attended the lectures in person. And having the complete lecture notes actually helped me pay attention to what the professor is saying. If I focus on writing extensive notes, I actually find that I have trouble paying attention to what's being spoken, since I mostly just focus on writing. \r\n\r\nTA AVAILABILITY\r\nMany TAs had office hours very early in the week when we just received the problem sets and when most people did not even have section yet. Only two Peer Tutors were available during the weekends. Realistically, most people finish the psets 1-2 days before they are due, so it would have been more helpful if there were at least one TA present during the weekend. If TA's aren't available on weekends. It would be helpful if we could have psets due on Wednesdays instead of Mondays. ",

Problem sets are assigned roughly once a week for the course and are usually more challenging than the material on the exams, which is good because it prepares students better for the exams. However, they can be poorly written or hard to follow at times. ",

Professor Berry does an excellent job of boiling down highly complex topics to make them easier to understand. In terms of improvement, lectures and most sections focused on the theory behind the operations we were asked to do on the PSETs and exams.

There were items on the problem sets that we never got to in class.  In section, my TA would set at the front of the room, tell us to do the problems, and give us the answers at the end.  I had to learn much of the material on my own, which was highly ineffective.  \r\n\r\nI wish we had gotten through the material in class so that I could understand it when I went to practice on the problem sets.  I am unsure of how to fix this, but I think we should teach TA's to teach effectively if we are going to offer sections for the course. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we did not get feedback on our work until after the midterms, which did not help me learn from my mistakes.

The other TA's should go to Eoin's sections or something before to see how to properly communicate a concept. That said, my main frustration was with the PSETs because it always seemed like the professor would teach the information after the PSET was due. Some type of reverse classroom situation the professor thinks is good for students to teach themselves or go to office hours, but when most of the TAs are imperious and unhelpful while Eoin only offers office hours for one of the days that I was never available, and sometimes you can't teach yourself something, it can truly make microeconomics a nightmare.

This study guide outlined what was likely to show up on the test, helping students who received it narrow down what they should study.

The tests in general are fair and representative of what was taught, what was on the psets, and what was on the practice exams.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is extremely sloppy, arbitrary, and unclear; the worst I've seen in 3 semesters at Yale. When I lost points, there was rarely any explanation given of why or even what part was wrong, and when there was an explanation, it was consistently unintelligible. Points were taken away for arbitrary reasons or because the grader just didn't bother reading through the whole solution, although this was somewhat balanced out by points not being taken away for things that were clearly wrong. The TA's who grade are clearly just trying to get it done as fast as possible and don't really care about doing a good job. I understand that there are a lot of students in the class, but there are a lot of TA's, too. On a similar point, sections weren't especially useful.

No, if you were like me and took Econ 115 hoping to get a better understanding of the economy so that you would be equipped for many possible majors and careers and to be an informed citizen generally, because this class is so theoretical that you learn very little about the real world, aside from understanding taxes and insurance (kind of). Steven Berry is a decent lecturer, but what really matters is which TA you get, and unfortunately that's just luck. You will learn how to do the kind of analysis and problem-solving you need if you want to take even harder Econ classes and then major in it, although you don't really learn these things in lecture, just in section or on your own while you study for the exams. The lectures were dry, dense, and not at all engaging. The sections were where I actually learned enough to be able to take the exams and do the problem sets. I don't think the content itself is unreasonably difficult, but it feels that way because after the first couple of weeks, the pace is insanely fast-- practically a chapter per lecture-- so there's no time to absorb what you're learning. I didn't feel like this class was optimized for learning. If you're not going to major in Econ, the theoretical nature of the problem sets starts to feel really pointless and it's hard to stay motivated.

If you are taking this as a QR credit or because you think it's good to know about economics for the \"real world,\" you probably aren't going to get what you want out of this course. It seems like it takes more than the intro level to be able to apply many of these theories to real-world scenarios. ",

It's not a terribly difficult class by any means, but the psets can be very difficult to understand alone so it might help to have a group of friends to talk them out with. Lecture can be extremelyyyy boring but Barry seems like a nice guy and cracks the occasional joke. ",

The workload and level of difficulty was moderate but manageable. The weaknesses of the course were frustrating at times, but nothing truly awful.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good intro to economics. I would recommend. ",
