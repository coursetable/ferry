            "\u00a0What CS research can look like and more in-depth knowledge about the specific field that my project was on ",

            "\u00a0Obviously there was domain-specific knowledge I learned in order to work on the project, but on top of that the biggest things were:\r\n1. Taking initiative in joining or proposing a project (in my case joining a project)\r\n2. Getting feedback, dealing with slip-ups or failures in the development process\r\n3. Time management and setting realistic goals for what can be done by the deadline ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me the opportunity to explore my interest in the intersection of legal and ethical questions surrounding computer science. I got to research a topic of interest and discuss my ideas with my adviser, who also found my topic and my research to be of interest. ",

            "\u00a0The language Coq, how to formally and mathematically prove things in code. I also learned a lot about the ethereum system, the compiler compcert, and how to build my own verified compiler. ",
            "\u00a0Doing a senior project was a great way to explore a field of computer science I was interested in and experience the world of research. ",
            "\u00a0This course is going to depend alot of who your advisor is and what your project is. You will learn a lot about managing a large project over the course of the semester. While you will learn how to do work on your own, meeting with your advisor is super important! Make sure to set up weekly meetings with your advisor to keep on track! ",
            "\u00a0Since I had the chance to work on a bigger project from start to finish, I was able to practice the process of research, design, implement, experiment, and iterate. I'm proud of the work I did and have a much better understanding of reinforcement learning now. ",
            "\u00a0My senior project has been a great learning experience. I learned about technologies I used to build my project such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. I learned how to write scalable and maintainable code to make debugging easier when I'm fixing bug or building new features. I also learned how to build a solid project architecture and develop a product from scratch all the way to deployment. ",

            "\u00a0While I do appreciate the federalist structure of the course, I think some overarching requirements/guidelines would be helpful for both parties (requiring professors to meet with students a certain amount of times a month, etc). ",

            "\u00a0I quite enjoyed the flexibility of this course - I got to study a topic of pertinence to current events. The course could use a little more structure - from my understanding, there were no clear intermediate deadlines, and there were other people in the course who did not know when their projects were due. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very loosely structured, but it's definitely a class that you can get alot out of if you choose to. You can also get very little out of it, so it depends on how you approach your project! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great flexibility to design a project suited to your interests. I definitely recommend this route because it makes the work inherently more interesting. "

            "\u00a0Very important to be smart about TIMING. Read all of the information about the department requirements at http://dus.cs.yale.edu/490.html EARLY to know what is expected of you. Consult with your adviser to set realistic goals for what you can get done over the term given your schedule. And have fun with it. The more work you have put into it over the term, the prouder you will feel of the result when at the end. ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend 490. I took it in my last semester and regret not taking it earlier. For anyone interested in research, it is a great way to get credit for learning about and working on a very specific interest. I recommend meeting with your advisor weekly if possible to give yourself deadlines that force you to accomplish intermediary goals throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0It's a good opportunity for some, and can be hard for others. It's very project/advisor dependent. "
