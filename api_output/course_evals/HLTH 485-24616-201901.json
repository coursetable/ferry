            "\u00a0This course taught me to expand my understanding of global health further and to incorporate more social justice frameworks into how I approach advocacy, research, and more. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an intense and deep dive into a number of topics in health inequities and health justice. It was a small-scale seminar class that met once a week and required a significant level of reading and interpretation of the readings from all of the students. Overall, you develop a deep knowledge of different topics in health justice and an appreciation of the multiple factors that go into creating health justice, as well as the ability to problematize a variety of factors in the current conceptualization of what health is. ",
            "\u00a0I did feel that I learned a lot about the health justice framework by the end of the course, although I was slower than most at grasping onto the collectivist nature of the framework. I really felt this was an essential course to keep in the GHS program - it takes all of the disease-specific issues we learned in previous GHS courses and gives us a larger picture of activism, policy, and accountability structures.\r\nI was also very proud of the paper I turned in at the end of the semester. Some classes, I feel I am turning in term papers at the end of the semester which I could have written at the beginning. But this year, I felt my paper was certainly not something I could have conceived of in the beginning of the semester and I felt a great deal of accomplishment in writing a complete work. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about health justice, different conceptual frames to approach health, health policy. We deconstructed different advocacy efforts and wrote a capstone. ",
            "\u00a0A critical lens with which to approach global health topics and debates - often yet unresolved. "

            "\u00a0This class does a good job of introducing new frameworks to understand the field of global health through. I have encountered these frameworks outside the space of the Global Health Scholars program and elated to see them being reflected in this space. I think this helped create a more robust conversation in class. I think all the participants benefitted from this class. I also loved our guest speaker, Cydnee Clay. I definitely think having more advocates come in and lecture could be a cool addition to the class. Another strength of the class was how the professors were not afraid to push students on their points. I think often at Yale, we get away with statements that we have not unpacked. This class encouraged us to look at the root of our statements. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure if the assignments of the class really served as impactful ways to implement our learning. The advocacy analysis was a good practice. The capstone project was frankly too much, especially as a graduating senior. It felt as if it was a second thesis and I was not quite sure the purpose of writing it. I think if the final deliverable could be changed to reflect something perhaps more creative or action-oriented, it would be better. For example, if you could have a creative project in which you were able to critique or explore an aspect of global health or global health justice. Presentations or research projects on this could be exciting for students who are not familiar with forms of global justice. I think at times the capstone projects seemed as though the issues of global health are large and perhaps not fully solvable. By focusing on movements, advocacy campaigns, etc. I think students can leave the class feeling inspired instead of feeling not sure what is next. ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely intense, and I think that is both a strength and weakness. The instructors expect all students to come to class ready to discuss the readings with a depth of knowledge that has been unprecedented in my own Yale career. While this is one of the greatest things about the class the expectations should be declared a little more clearly and the class could also feature a little more diversity of activities. The days that there were presentations or other visual aids midway through the class were some of the best because they refreshed us students and also made us demonstrate our thinking process in real-time; discussions had a tendency as well to be dominated by a few voices, and this wasn't particularly helpful especially when those voices flattened the viewpoints of others. The discussions were extremely freeform, and having some notions of what we might expect going into the class would have been extremely helpful in going through the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-teachers are very passionate and informed about subject matter\r\n-readings, although numerous, were very interesting and relevant\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-feedback was inconsistent, and often delayed (did not know first grade until after spring break)\r\n-grading policies were not transparent \r\n-classroom discussions seemed forced, and students were often time cut off \r\n-discussions were point-by-point analysis of readings, with very little attention put towards integrating the readings as a whole\r\n-student input seems to not have mattered\r\n-definitely did not feel like a seminar, more like a lecture \r\n-at times, professors created a very intimidating classroom environment in which students felt uncomfortable\r\n-unclear what the \"so what?\" is from the course \r\n\r\nImprovements: \r\n-making the course more centered on student discussion \r\n-more emphasis on integrating readings\r\n-a 3:7 teacher:student ratio is intimidating--easing this with different seating options (or even a different classroom) would eliminate the \"us vs. them\" mentality some of us had during discussion \r\n-willingness to hear students out before interruption ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this class could have slightly restructured the timeline - we had 8 very productive weeks of readings, but I wish that we had started our capstones earlier, perhaps turning in proposals in the first week or two, and having a first draft due before spring break rather than after. Regular drafting check-ins would also have been a good way to have us start thinking about our personal projects earlier and with regularity, relating them to the topics we learned in class. I felt the class already did have a good amount of work, but a possible assignment could be each week of readings accompanied by short written reflections on how the topics relate to our individual capstones. Overall, I wish that the program had moved up the timeline for thinking about our projects. As it stands now, I felt the capstone was largely relegated to the second half of the semester. I really enjoyed the in class peer review, though.\r\n\r\nThe last comment I have surrounds the GHS program in general. I really wish the program could be listed formally, either on our diplomas or some other form of recognition. I know of people who werenin the program but who dropped out before completing it and still can call themselves Global Health Scholars because they were in the program for a year. But if there were a mark of completion, thered be a standard for participation. ",
            "\u00a0the first and second halves of this course were very different -- the first half was mainly just reading of academic papers, and the second half was focused more on practical applications. the frame of health justice was nice, but seemed a little constraining for some of the student's interests. since it is a capstone class for global health, and students enter the program for very different reasons, it might be good to structure the class so that it's more flexible in the future. That said, the profs did a good job of accommodating a wide range of final projects this year! ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the readings and the peer-review feedback was extremely interesting! However, I think just knowing what the class is ahead of time in general as a Global Health Scholar will be helpful, because I felt I had done my capstone last summer and this was almost secondary to that. A surprisingly heavy workload which was difficult senior spring, so again just knowing what to expect will make the class better. Overall really engaging seminars and deep discussions. All three professor clearly have an immense amount of knowledge that I was glad to learn from! "

            "\u00a0If you are a student in the global health program, I would absolutely recommend you take this class. The level of instructor accountability as well as the challenge of problematizing everything you've learnt in past global health classes is extremely refreshing and will bring new clarity to your eyes about global and public health. That being said, be ready for a challenge: Professors Miller, Daryani, and Whitaker expect a lot from the students because they themselves contribute tirelessly to the class environment. You will receive better feedback than from any other Yale professors, but you will also be challenged more than you were by any other Yale professor. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would advise Global Health Scholars to take the fall semester capstone instead of this one. ",
            "\u00a0A very important topic in global health! A must-take if you want to have a fuller understanding of current advocacy efforts. ",
            "\u00a0if you're interested in health justice, it is a good class to take. if you are working on a capstone, but don't have original research to take the first semester course, then this is a good class to take. Pretty cool readings too! but if you're not in the global health scholars program, it may not be a good fit, since a lot of the work is structured around the GHS program. "
