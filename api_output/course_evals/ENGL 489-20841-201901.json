            "\u00a0Advanced training in playwriting. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to hone my skills in writing, revising, and reading poetry.  Perhaps more significant for this long term project has been the process of thinking about how poems feel as a unit.  I learned a lot about how to put poems together in order to enhance their individual qualities, which has provoked me to think more deeply about what it means to pull together a book or collection as opposed to merely writing poems as stand-alone pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I became a more thoughtful, musical, and serious poet. A wonderful opportunity to dive into an original project and work through your practice. ",
            "\u00a0The writing concentration allows for work on a long-term creative project on a larger scale than other creative writing courses. Students are able to receive detailed feedback and guidance from their advisers. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend that the creative writing concentration be broken up to facilitate more collaboration and community between students writing in the same genre. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course have of course been the opportunity to work closely with an advisor and to think and work intensely on a project I care deeply about.  I really don't know how it might be improved because the experience is so individuated. ",
            "\u00a0There should be a two-semester option. ",
            "\u00a0the writing concentration as a program in my opinion is not well-organized to facilitate writing community. there should be small groups in the different genres so that we can actually engage with each other's work! 5 mins a piece with no comments in between doesn't honor anyone's stuff. there should be food at the dinners not just an instruction to get stuff from the dhall because people aren't on the meal plan. more attention to how we can really be in community with each other and feel invested in what other people are working on.

It is so fulfilling to see the work come together and to have had the opportunity to reflect on how my writing has changed and grown over the past four years. ",
