            "\u00a0I learned new tenses, important vocabulary, some not as essential vocabulary like car parts, as well as gained practice speaking orally and building my confidence in the language that way. ",
            "\u00a0French improved a lot from first semester French L1 course. ",
            "\u00a0I advanced in french speaking skills, grammar, and vocabulary. "

            "\u00a0I wish the course packet had had the correct page numbers because that was confusing at times for us students. I did not use it as much this semester. Except for final review. It was good for that. ",
            "\u00a0This course will teach French fast and the faculty in the French department are great. There are no other strengths. The curriculum is terribly designed to make you an anxious overworked mess all semester. If you took french in high school, you'll be okay. If you have a natural talent for French, you'll be okay. If you're like me and have neither natural talent nor years of experience, you're absolutely screwed, despite the L1-L2 sequence supposedly being for beginners with no prior french experience. The workload is way too much, especially considering how much of the daily exercises are tedious. There is a test every single week, which meant I was studying for a minimum of 6 hours over the weekend(you don't learn all the testable material until the Friday before anyway), in addition to meeting with a French tutor for an hour weekly. Yes, I put a lot of work in and my grades were much improved from 1st semester. But that shouldn't have had to cost me my mental health and my grades in other classes. Despite how much I love the language and want to speak it, and how great my professor was, I'm sorry to say that the testing and workload was just too much for me and I imagine for other students as well- which is a shame if the goal is to teach eager, inexperienced students the French language. ",
            "\u00a0My section in particular was quite small, which helped to get direct help and for the professor to attune to individual learning skills. More emphasis on in class written activities (as opposed to speaking) might have helped me more. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone very interested in learning french and one who is not taking other difficult courses concurrently. This is not a course to slack off in. There are tests every week and two hours of workbook homework a night plus weekly compositions. You will learn more french in a short amount of time than you would have expected, but it will not come without due diligence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is effective in learning the basics of a new language. "
