            "\u00a0Functional Analysis is nice, but the quality of the class depends a lot on who's teaching it. Manas has been great, but you should research carefully who's teaching this class when you plan to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend this class. Both useful and beautiful. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class without taking any of the real analysis track beforehand (I had taken 230-231, as well as 310). For the first half of the course, I had a hard time keeping up with the concepts and pace. But at some point during the semester, a switch flipped in my mind, and I was able to understand the theorems covered in lecture and their basic implications. If you have a similar background to me, I'd say it is possible to do well in this class, but only if you're willing to put in arbitrarily large amounts of work. Manas moves quickly in lecture, but his teaching style is actually quite good, and he will gauge the audience regularly to see if people are following his train of thought. He's also infamously sloppy with his psets and exams: both of them were often much harder than he originally anticipated when writing them up. That being said, even if you perform poorly on his tests, you WILL learn functional analysis, if only because you spend so much time working on the psets. "
