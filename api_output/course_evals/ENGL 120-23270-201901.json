            "\u00a0I have learned how to not only write about things that happen to me and the world around me in a variety of styles, but also how to read and notice those styles in order to create new types of my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is a fabulous course! I became a more critical reader and writer over the course of the semester. We talked a lot about \"reading for writing,\" which was a change from past English classes that focused mainly on literary analysis. Prior to this class, pretty much the only creative writing I had done was for college apps. The five pieces we wrote (personal essay, place, profile, cultural critique, and humor) were great, open-ended assignments that were challenging and fun to write. ",
            "\u00a0How to closely read and write essays about personal experiences, places, people, cultural critiques, and humor. How to match form and content to effectively communicate what you want to say ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills VASTLY improved. (I also learned a fair bit about reading nonfiction as literature.) I also tried whole new scary forms of writing including satire and interviewing. The latter took me way outside my comfort zone to walk into a stranger's office and ask for an interview. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing significantly. I did not realize the difference between creative nonfiction and academic writing, so this was a unique skill that I developed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage my time and improve my writing with drafts and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me develop my writing, and has put me on track to consider the English major. ",
            "\u00a0While other writing courses have taught me how to read critically and write academically, English 120 helped develop my own voice as a creative writer and read other pieces with a view to identify their strengths and then incorporate those strengths into my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to weave a lot of nuance into my writing--how to use my writing to SHOW, not TELL. I learned a lot about literary devices and other tools that modern essayists use to expose certain feelings and phenomena. I learned how to read essays between the lines and analyze how their authors play with imagery. I learned how to keep readers interested and how to maintain momentum in essay writing. I learned how to make my writing more concise and how to play with sentence (and paragraph) length and structure to change the tone/mood of my writing. I learned how to constructively critique others' work. I learned how to draw a public point from an essay even if it's conveyed subtly. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: All the readings are amazing as well as the discussions in class. The blogs were a fun way to get me thinking critically, but it should be encouraged for students to interact with the blogs more. I also enjoyed the workshops we would do for every paper because it gave us all a chance to see each other's writing and new, fun ideas that we may never have thought of otherwise.\r\nWeaknesses: None! ",
            "\u00a0The course readings are great. I really like the concept of \"creative nonfiction\" and the focus on writing personal essays with public significance. I think the class is well-paced, with a draft or final essay due every week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Small class size, seminar-style class with opportunities for teacher-led discussion, helpful feedback from the professor before final draft submission,  in-class workshops to review peers' papers \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Level of student engagement in discussion (some contribute more than others); it may be helpful to occasionally break out into small groups to help discussion ",
            "\u00a0This course is nearly perfect in every way. My one suggestion would be to even out the readings so there are fewer nights with massive assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated my instructor and the style of her teaching and the course. I learned so much, as I describe in other answers. I do wish that we had analyzed texts more in-depth, though we did much more towards the end of the semester (midterm feedback was taken!). I also think that the grading structure is more suited to a huge intro STEM course, and cannot be applied to a 13-person seminar -- it seems unlikely that every class of that size will have half A students and half B students. \r\n\r\nAlso, I feel like Prof Ulrich should just post all the readings on Canvas at the beginning of the semester, since she stopped sending them out and some were hard to find. We probably won't do them in advance anyway. It was expensive to print that much, so if possible, printing them for us would be a huge help, maybe in smaller classes. I have dropped courses because I could not afford a $80 course packet, though, so I appreciate not having that. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- both the reading and writing was almost always fun, so it was easy to keep up with the work. \r\n\r\nWeakness- the constant deadlines were often stressful to meet. Also, due dates on Friday nights were often frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength, for me, was the online comments section that we had to enter before every class. It helped me gain an understanding of what my peers thought about the reading that was supposed to be discussed in class and this understanding was essential in helping me prepare for the class.\r\n\r\nI think this class was very fast-paced with students handing in papers almost every week. While I appreciated that this pace helped me write a lot, sometimes, I have seen myself compromise the quality of my writing just to make the submission deadline. Reducing one assignment might help the students focus on the quality of their writing. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum is wonderful. The readings are intriguing, fun, and not too long. They really make you think differently about life and the world. Class discussions are run well, although there were a lot of long periods of silence during class. Sometimes the questions posed were a little too broad. I definitely liked having a draft due a week before every final version was due, but having something due every weekend made the workload seem pretty heavy. The writing tutor extensions were great because they pushed students to meet with writing tutors and get more feedback. The prompts for the five papers were what I loved most about the class. They were difficult in that they always asked you to use your essay to make a serious, nuanced point. But they made me think a lot about myself and other people and things in the world that I would otherwise never look at closely. \r\nI think the one thing that could be improved here is the class discussions. They were all the same, and by the end of the semester, I was zoning out for long periods of time during every class. I could tell Emily was trying to change it up towards the end of the semester, so she's on the right track. I definitely think more pair work would be a good idea, and even moooore use of the chalkboard. Mini personal whiteboards are always a good move. It would be cool if the students could do little group activities to engage more with the text and with each other. That was one bad thing about this course--I never grew close with the other students because we never really had a chance to talk to each other privately during class. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! This is one of the best intro writing courses a Yale student could take! Please, if you never take another serious writing course, at least take this one! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had a great experience. I am more confident with creative writing, and I feel like I have a better idea of what to look for as I edit my writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. The readings are really interesting and even more so when we dissect them in class. It's a different type of writing that strays from the academic research paper, and it was really fun to write these different essays! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! This is the best course at Yale (that I've taken). It's a ton of work, since there's an essay draft due almost every week and huge piles of reading (that you won't want to skip because it's all fascinating and well-written), but if you don't have anything else excessively time-consuming in your schedule it is beyond worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was very engaging and prof Ulrich is super friendly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot and enjoyed the course. It was a huge drain to be writing so much, so take into mind if you are a slow writer. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. It was so much fun and I definitely improved my writing! ",
            "\u00a0English 120 has, without a doubt, been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I took this course because a lot of students recommended it to me and I will continue recommending it to anyone who is interested in taking a writing course. This course takes a step beyond academic writing and for all writers, developing their non-academic writing voice is very important. I absolutely loved the readings for this class and I also loved writing all my essays for this class. Assignments such as the memoir assignment and the place assignment are opportunities of deep reflection and introspection. Such opportunities are really hard to come by, especially in a fast-paced academic environment and I'm really thankful that this class was able to do that for me. ",
            "\u00a0100%. I hated English throughout high school, but I loved this class. It definitely made me want to take more writing classes. The paper prompts make you question little things in life to which you would otherwise never hold a magnifying glass. The professors are wonderful and lead tough discussions. As long as you are invested in the class and don't worry too much about grades, your writing will improve a lot. You'll be proud of the work you do. You'll read some riveting modern essays and learn how to add nuance, imagery, meaning, and structure to your writing. "
