            "\u00a0In this course, we went deeper into decision theory and learned advanced topics coming straight out of the literature. We gained a stronger sense of how to go through the dance of prooving upper and lower bounds for minimax estimators after watching Harry go through this process for a variety of models. ",
            "\u00a0This has probably been my favorite Statistics class I've taken at Yale.  I learned many common techniques presented in proofs of minimax rates. This class gave me the ability to understand papers presented in statistics, and I developed a love for statistics because of it. This class is also great because it allows you to hone the basic skills you've learned in other classes, and you can really see how everything fits together. ",
            "\u00a0Got a great overview of cutting edge research in statistical decision theory and related fields-- both primary results and open problems. Discussed on a high level how to go about approaching complex problems like those discussed. ",
            "\u00a0This was really great complement to taking Nonparametric Estimation with John Lafferty - it was nice to see all the nitty gritty details of these (fairly involved) proofs! Also really neat to encounter new ideas like Bayesian Posterior Contraction as a frequentist justification for Bayesian procedures, etc. "

            "\u00a0This was a very strong course. The lectures were excellent and engaging. Harry is simply an incredible, enthusiastic teacher and a well deserving recipient of the teaching prize (that he is soon to receive.) The material was also interesting, and it was nice seeing applications of mathematics to statistical decision theory. I think the main weakness of the course was the length of the lectures. As energetic as Harry is, 2 hours and 15 minutes is simply too long maintain concentration. In a typical lecture, I would be very engaged and understand everything until about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the lecture, and then lose my focus. I would recommend either having a 5-10 minute break to stretch in the middle of the lecture or scheduling 2 shorter lectures each week. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great! The biggest strength is that Harry is willing to take the time to answer your questions, no matter how \"dumb\" you may think they are. Because it's an upper-level seminar, there are no dumb questions, however. The only \"weakness\" is that the class can feel like it goes too quickly sometimes, or sometimes there is a subject that is just too advanced and it blows you away. However, going back over the notes a couple times helps me understand it again. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Yay high-speed proof-based classes! It was great being able to just learn all that material without having to worry about homework at the same time. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, though likely if you are considering taking this course you will have already taken Statistical Inference with Harry, and will already know how fun and engaging his lectures are. Harry covers advanced material, often from the literature in this course, and somehow makes the lectures fun and interesting. \r\n\r\nThis course has very low workload as well. The only homework was to take notes for two of the lectures and submit a typed up version of the notes for these two lectures by the end of the semester. This was by far the lowest workload class I have ever taken at Yale as an undergrad, but this was exactly what I needed given all the other things going on for me this semester. If you are looking to get credit for going to interesting lectures, and doing basically no homework or studying this class would be a great choice.\r\n\r\nOne other note is that in class Harry often pauses lecture to suggest interesting, possible senior thesis projects. Thus if you are a second term junior who wants to come up with ideas for a senior project, or a second term senior who needs a last minute idea for a senior project, this is a great course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100%. If you're a statistics major, you NEED to take this course. It's not required but taking it with Harry will change your life. You learn so much about minimax rates and new developments in statistics. You learn how to read statistics papers, and you really hone all the basic skills you've learned in other classes. Plus, the workload is not too bad, so it's actually very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You should make sure you have a strong background in theoretical statistics (*ideally* you've taken 410/610 -- I think there would be a good degree of disconnect between your knowledge and the material taught otherwise), but Harry is an absolutely incredible professor and the material discussed is fascinating. Overall, a really chill course which exposes you (in an incredibly digestible manner) to some of the coolest problems (and some of their solutions) in current statistical research. ",
            "\u00a0If Prof. Zhou does this the same way next time he teaches it (i.e. scribing notes instead of psets and exams), if you like proof-based classes, and if you're already at least somewhat familiar with statistical inference, take this class! You'll learn a lot along the way, and while the material is really high level, at least you won't have homework! "
