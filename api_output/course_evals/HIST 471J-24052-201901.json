            "\u00a0This was the first class that really made me think about how to write a history paper. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me far, far more than I ever even thought I knew about aid, development aid, and their origins.  It also was a wonderful introduction into a historians perspective on events and their causes, and helped expand my perspective beyond the classic political science approaches ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the decade-by-decade history of development since the 1940s. This course helped me develop the skills necessary to look at primary and secondary sources in conjunction with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a substantial amount about the history of development and development aid from its introduction in the post-World War II and into the present day approach. With the use of great primary sources, you develop an understanding of how the Western, Soviet, and Global South's interpretations and visions for development differed and converged, among several other things. This class really helps you to situate and sift through the true intentions of leaders, while also understanding the humanitarian effects of their policies. ",
            "\u00a0History of development aid and their larger international context in the 20th century ",
            "\u00a0This reading and conversation really developed my understanding of this time period. ",
            "\u00a0Through seminar discussions and weekly written responses, I learned about international development from a historical perspective. The course focused on events and themes throughout the 20th century. Economic inequality was a big topic, of course  but also a slew of other things like family planning and community development. I'd take a look at the syllabus; it's very thorough and pretty spot on, I think. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about the idea of \"development,\" starting from its colonial roots, to the Cold War, the neoliberal turn of the 1980s, to the present. It was fascinating for our class to slowly deconstruct this idea of \"development,\" which we often take as given in other classes or departments at Yale.  I also enjoyed learning about development globally from the perspectives of actors in the United States, the Soviet Union, and especially countries in the Global South, like India. ",
            "\u00a0You definitely learn a great deal about the history of development aid, academic research, and historical analysis in this course. Professor Engerman is a true academic who cares deeply about learning, and that is reflected in every detail of the course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It was a very strong course overall, one which provides great historical background and contrasting perspectives on the whole project of development.  It conveys those perspectives well, and helps guide students through analysis of the same.  The main weakness of the course is that it could have connected a little more closely or explicitly with the modern day, but that's not much of a complaint in general. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course and I dont think there were many weaknesses to it, but I think that it should have been classed as a writing credit given we ended up writing around 40 pages throughout the semester including the final paper and the weekly whick responses. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class. It is a true historical class based in primary sources and led by a fantastic and knowledgable professor in David Engerman. ",
            "\u00a0This course was superbly well done. The readings were great and rather diverse (both the primary and secondary sources) and the subject matter was compelling (and really, really relevant, especially if you're hoping to go into global affairs or political work in the future). I also really appreciated having the weekly written responses, which were due at 6 a.m. the day of class; the questions made us think critically about development each week and forced us to keep on top of the material. To add, Professor Engerman reviewed all of our writing every morning, used some of our points to guide discussion, and always got us feedback on Canvas by the end of the day. I can think of no weaknesses for this course (other than the fact that the Pauli Murray elevator stopped working for a week, so we had to walk up six flights of stairs to the seminar room!). ",
            "\u00a0The readings and syllabus are super interesting and well-structured, class discussion is always interesting, and Prof. Engerman is a fantastic teacher and seminar leader. "

        [
            "\u00a0Prof. Engerman truly knows how to teach. So many professors are really brilliant, but can't translate that into teaching, but Engerman knows how to help and support students, which is so great. He makes himself very available. The class is a fair amount of work and reading, but doable. I found the secondary sources to sometimes be very convoluted and couldn't really understand what they were trying to say, but other than that the class was manageable and definitely interesting. The class is a fair amount of writing, enough I think for it to qualify as a WR credit (which I think Engerman should make happen). Engerman is a great new professor at Yale and I definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yep! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to others, it is one of the best and most constructive seminars I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0yes. not enough classes at Yale in history about the developing world. embarrassing as an institution ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Engerman is incredibly knowledgable about the subject and has built a fantastic syllabus with interesting primary sources from a variety of perspectives that helps build a holistic understanding of how development progressed. Professor Engerman is extremely accessible and provides great feedback as you develop your historical writing skills, culminating with a substantial final research paper on a topic of your choosing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for anyone wanting to learn about development and how policies shifted. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Just take a look at my answers to some of the other questions for reasons why. Everything from the material to the professor was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course! Whether you're a history major, a global affairs major, or an economics major, you'll learn a lot from this class and take away a fresh new perspective that will allow you to think critically about what \"development\" means. ",
            "\u00a0If you are prepared to work a bit/learn a lot, take it! "
