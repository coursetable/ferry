            "\u00a0I improved my speaking and writing skills immensely by taking this course. My confidence in my Spanish skills increased as well. ",
            "\u00a0I have become a much better writer, speaker, and listener in Spanish. I no longer hesitate to speak and share my thoughts in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I polished up my Spanish and improved my conversation and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly just more practice with speaking and writing. Worked on fluidity a lot, and precision of language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my grammar, writing, reading, and speaking skills with this course as there are many assignments that make you think about how to develop your craft as a Spanish speaker. Additionally, I learned how to speak more like a native Spanish speaker, incorporating idioms into my speech. We also developed our reading skills as we learned to read on a more nuanced level (finding and discussing themes, motifs, foreshadowing) during the novel reading unit. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my vocabulary and grammar, which helped with my writing and speaking. I also learned about some writers and musical artists that are famous in the Spanish-speaking world. The constant speaking during class, as well as the oral exercises and evaluations, were good for working on improvised speaking and conveying more complex thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Grammar review, more confidence in speaking, insights on Spanish and Latin American culture. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my conversation, reading, writing, and listening skills in Spanish, while also developing more fluency and a greater cultural appreciation for Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that I greatly improved my Spanish speaking and writing capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more vocabulary and learned how to speak more fluidly and adopted some colloquial phrases in to my vocabulary. I also leaned a lot about latin american culture through short stories and films. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my grammar, especially the use of transition words and the subjunctive. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the discussions we had in class that helped us cultivate our speaking skills. \r\nOne weakness was that the grammar focus was rarely integrated in our every day speaking and only used on homework and tests. ",
            "\u00a0Students receive an abundance of practice for their Spanish through the homework and although it felt like it could be too much at times, it felt worth it. The class was always an engaging experience and Prof. Valle was always sure that everyone had a chance to participate. She also gave very good feedback on all our assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Organization was a little weak overall. I think it was mostly an issue with the professor though. ",
            "\u00a0Homework often felt kind of like a waste of time, but on the whole it was good. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that we touched on all facets of the Spanish language and developed them in a deliberate and specific way to make us both more comfortable and more confident when speaking, writing, and reading Spanish. The weakness was that sometimes the work load was overloaded with 3-4 long homework assignments due each class. It sometimes got to the point where it was not longer enjoyable because there was so much to do. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there are a lot of opportunities to improve your reading, writing, and speaking because of the many in-class and homework activities. Additionally, Sonia Valle is an amazing professor because she gives in-depth corrections and feedback for all turned in work, both written and spoken. Unfortunately, the course did not have enough opportunities to improve listening skills. I would have preferred listening to more songs during class and for homework (and modern songs, not just old songs), instead of the insane number of other homework assignments we had every night, most of which involved a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Valle is very responsible and gives detailed feedback on assignments, the course material is generally interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the variety of assignments and activities\r\nWeaknesses: the syllabus changed, but the students were not informed. there were also issues with the online discussions on canvas ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a very good job encouraging discussion among the students. The small class size was conducive toward intimate and profound discussions on the course's assigned readings. Generally, I did not find any weaknesses that stuck out to me. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course is the small class size. All students are able to participate and engage in the class, and it felt like the students were driving the conversation, although it was facilitated by the professor. It could possibly be improved by more discussion of textssome texts we didn't get to fully discuss, or the discussion felt cut a bit short. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good as is. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. Definitely take it if you are looking to work on your Spanish skills. For context, the class resembles AP Spanish Language and Culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You receive so much feedback for all your work you are guaranteed to improve your Spanish skills both in and out of class. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to continue learning Spanish, then taking this course isn't the worst decision you could make. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I would not recommend it to a student who is more confident in their own spanish speaking ability than I am. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as it helped me become more comfortable and more confident with my Spanish. My Spanish is the best it has ever been after taking this course. However, I would warn the student that it is a lot of work and that a large time commitment is necessary to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course as a solid L5 class that will keep you using your Spanish, but there are definitely less time-consuming L5 courses at there, though they may not be as good for maintain a good level of writing AND speaking. If you do take the course, take it with Sonia Valle because she is excellent, keeping the class interesting and giving super clear feedback on all assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to someone not completely comfortable with their Spanish language skills looking to practice the language in a relatively low-stress way. Workload is pretty consistent and requires daily commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a great Spanish class for those that placed into L5, but may not have felt prepared to go on to another L5 class. It was the perfect space to take risks and develop all aspects of the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0If a student really wanted to improve their writing and speaking capabilities, I would definitely recommend this course. By repeatedly writing responses to the readings and discussing them in class, I believe I was able to gain a mastery in the language that I would only gain by visiting countries that spoke the language. I think that this course does a good job of encouraging use of Spanish both inside and outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I would hIGHLY recommend this class to any students who are interested in improving their spanish writing or speaking (especially their speaking). This class forces you to speak more than other classes, and definitely helped me speak with a better accent. It was enjoyable and educational, with more challenging texts intermixed with more fun videos. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a good course especially once the students and professor become more comfortable with each other. "
