            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it allowed students to be creative and do experimental projects on the topic that is most relevant to them, and also the two professors who give valuable insight and support. One weakness is that some of the groups struggled with the age-old problem of uneven participation. This put additional work on the shoulders of certain students and allowed others to benefit from their work undeservedly. This occurred in every single one of the four groups to some degree. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy working in teams and working on projects, but I do not enjoy team work for grades as you are subject to the whims, caprice and schedules of others. I liked my team members very much and its not personal, but some people like to do things early and others do not. And it leads to endless frustration when at this level, you cannot make people do their work differently. I would figure out a way around this for a final grade as I think it  imposes an unfair burden on those who do not enjoy waiting until the last minute to complete the required work. Even though a delay might be justifiable, it is still a complete annoyance to those who work in a different manner. I understand field work involves teamwork, but that setting is different and teaching people how to work in groups in a classroom is limited by control over the schedules, personalities, and priorities. Thanks. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should try to collaborate more with CCAM to help students with the video aspect. An optional basic video class would be nice. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Experimental archaeology is an interesting field and one best explored through hands-on experience, thus a class setting is the best way to learn it. ",
