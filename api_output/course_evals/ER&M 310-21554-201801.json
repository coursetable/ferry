            "\u00a0This class has greatly developed my ability to critically consume media with fantastical themes like those listed in the title of the course. I learned about the culture and history of pre-Civil War Americas, and have become more aware of how slavery has echoing impacts through the modern day. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to analyze themes from different periods and contexts, as well as a more critical eye of film and text ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of both horror films and entertainment horror, generally speaking, as well as a good deal about the history of the Atlantic Caribbean and the work Americans in particular did to \"other\" it.  Essentially found myself thinking more deeply about zombies, pirates, witches, and ghosts as products of a very racist western world history, and the ways in which it has changed over the last century or so. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned so much from Professor Ramirez and this course. We dug deep into the history of zombies, pirates, ghosts, and witches. I developed critical studies of how these characters emerged and what perceptions or misconceptions shape these subversive characters. The interesting topics challenged us especially by how intellectually stimulating they were. The class helped shape how I analyze other information and texts. A very helpful and engaging class! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a foundational framework for understanding myth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the four themes of the course title relate back to roots in the Caribbean. ",
            "\u00a0This course proved the ways in which figures like zombies, pirates, ghosts, and witches are founded in racial injustice. The course poignantly connected these tropes to historical context, solidifying my knowledge of early Caribbean history. Additionally, the course truly strengthened my writing abilities. The course was listed as a writing credit, and Professor Ramrez dealt closely with the best ways to craft a paper. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging with multimedia sources to do scholarly work. ",
            "\u00a0Synthesizing historical, literary, and theoretical perspectives into a coherent argument/analysis; critical analysis of film; use of primary sources; historical understandings of pop culture and imaginaries; reading primary sources in conversation with one another and with secondary sources; in-class discussions of material "

        [
            "\u00a0The mix of primary and secondary texts was incredibly valuable, and Professor Ramrez brought us to a very high level of class discussion. I think the class could be improved by engaging slightly more with \"canonical\" versions of the creatures we studied (ie, The Walking Dead) and examining how race is still present even in less explicit forms. I also think that the \"pirates\" unit could be eliminated to expand either ghosts or witches to bring about more thematic consistency between units. Finally, I personally would have appreciated a mix with a few more secondary sources in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting, though was perhaps a bit lopsided in its focus (very heavy on zombies with barely any coverage on pirates) and helped me look at mythology and fiction in religious and historical contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I was really riveted by the zombies and witches section - and was really glad that we got to spend so much time on them.  Nonetheless, I feel as though I was missing something in the ghosts and pirates section, simply because I did not feel like we got enough time with the material.  Additionally, as much as I hate having a ton of reading, I felt like having some background readings (if at all available) on witches and ghosts would have been nice, as it would have historicized it as it did zombies.  But overall, the reading list, the discussions, the film list, and all were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing! I think the discussions that our class had were so enlightening! The discussions and the questions that Professor Ramirez and my peers brought up were what made the class great. It was a pleasure to go to the class every week especially because of the supportive and fun-loving environment that Professor Ramirez created! There was a good selection of texts, but since there is a huge presence of these characters in popular culture, many novels, books and other media were left out. However, the final paper allowed to you bring in outside media that shaped you and inspired you to take this class, and you were able to put them in conversation with the themes that we learned inside the classroom. The topic of the class was so amazing because, at times, it could be really intense, but still, we couldn't always take ourselves too seriously. I've really enjoyed this class, and I consider it to be one of the strongest ones that I have taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course with no weaknesses other than the lack of time devoted to Pirates. ",
            "\u00a0There are literally no strengths or weaknesses. I would take the course again exactly as is. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is all around excellent with a great mix of material. The assignments were manageable yet challenging (though the first paper was challenging in its shortness and a few extra pages would have allowed more engagement with the material). Class discussions were well-organized and consistently engaging - I usually found myself losing track of time. I was sad we missed a couple classes but that's extenuating circumstances of course - though I think the seminar would have worked as a twice-a-week seminar just as well. More detailed feedback on papers might have been helpful, though Prof. Ramirez's verbal feedback and help in office hours and during class time was invaluable. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. The pop culture makes the racial critique easily digestible for those unused to dealing with the afterlives of slavery, and brings a new angle to those who had previously dealt with race in other contexts. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!!! Unfortunately, you won't be able to take it with Prof. Ramirez since she's moving to Brown, but if anyone else takes up the mantle, I would recommend you at least give it a try. (And if you know anyone at Brown, tell them to keep an eye out for her courses!!!!!!!!!!!!) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the instructor was dynamic and interesting and the course gave me fascinating insight to other themes in popular culture ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I'm big on getting constructive feedback so I really appreciated how honest Professor Ramirez was on all of my papers.  I wasn't left with a sense of \"Okay but WHY did I not get a better grade\" it was always more so \"Okay so let's do this next time because now we know better\", and I think that's really valuable in a class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was absolutely fantastic! I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings were amazing and the class discussions were so riveting and fun. You could see the passion that Professor Ramirez and all the other students brought to this class. Everyone should take this class if they ever have the opportunity! I will never forget this amazing class or Professor Ramirez! ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone. This course sets the foundation for an exploration into race in the post-colonial city and is absolutely essential in understanding the Caribbean and Americas. Professor Ramrez is an absolutely incredible teacher - I would recommend this course to fellow students just so they could meet and be mentored by her. Not only was this course engaging, it was important. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ramirez will not be teaching this class again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - one of my favorite classes I've taken ever. The syllabus is engaging and touches on a wide range of material and sources. "
