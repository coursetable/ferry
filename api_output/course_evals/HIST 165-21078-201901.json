            "\u00a0. ",
            "\u00a0I am really glad I took the course. I learned some of the broader themes in 20th century American history which is exactly what I wanted to get out of the course. I came to understand how the political parties developed in the past, learned about a lot of different social movements in each era. To think that I lived in this country for ten years without knowing all of these things! I have a much better understanding of how America came to be as I know it today. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the major political trends and social movements in the US over the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a must-take in my opinion. It filled in a lot of the holes in my understanding of US politics. Professor Gage does a fantastic job of explaining the undercurrents and themes that give rise to and live on following big historical moments. ",
            "\u00a0The course assignments were very conducive to learning how to do archival research, and for that reason I appreciated the assignments. Professor Gage gave very clear lectures that charted the course of 20th century American history. Learned about socialism in the U.S. in early 20th century, roaring 20s volunteerism, New Deal politics and southern democrats, American responses to the depression and WWII, postwar consensus, polarization of the two parties, Reagan, Clinton, Bush. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome! I had never really learned about 20th century American history (especially past the 50s) in school before, and it was a clear gap in my knowledge. This course really helped fill in the details about this period and helped me understand how 21st century American came to be. We focused on the changing powers and role of the federal government and the evolution of America's political parties. It was a lot of content that I felt I should have already known, so it was nice to catch up on it! The course's themes were so interesting and relevant. The assignments also allowed me to gain some hands on experience with Yale's resources. Especially the assignment with the Manuscripts and Archives and the one in the stacks. I really felt like I was taking advantage of some classic Yale resources that I had never used before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the 20th century, specifically how certain movements led to others. The flow of the course was very strong. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about 20th Century American history, particularly about the social movements and domestic progress in America at this time. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview of the political and social change that occurred during the 20th century, as well as analysis of trends throughout the century. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty solid understanding of broad US political movements throughout the course of the 20th century. Professor Gage introduced the class to various historical approaches and did a good job of touching on giving a really strong overview, which was supplemented by a nice selection of mainly primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0American History of the 20th century - quite cool ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned some research basics and a general social history of the US in the twentieth century. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the American century, learned skills such as using the rare manuscripts and archives, how to adequately use the stacks, and the congressional record. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an incredibly comprehensive dive into the politics and American global affairs of the 20th century, one which was entirely underpinned by the narrative of everyday citizens living in each passing era. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about 20th century American history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more detailed story of 20th Century American history than I had previously known. It gave me a great context for how politics in America has changed over the past century. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the history of the US in the twentieth century. We considered how events connected to each other, and how political change has brought us to our modern day political climate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many things about America in the 20th century I don't even know where to start. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of 20th-century American history, largely focusing on legislative and electoral concerns but with attention as well to social movements and military engagements. This was my first history course at Yale, and the well-designed short writing assignments helped me get a sense of the various research methods that historians use. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much nuance about American history that I totally missed in high school. I also learned how to effectively write really short papers (which really teaches you how to prioritize!) I also learned about the origins of a lot of movements and their distinctions. I think we have a tendency to throw around \"progressive\" \"conservative\" and \"liberal\", but this classes teaches you the origins of this movements in a way that's really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly interesting course for someone who had never learned US history.  I learned a lot about political trends, etc. in US 20th century history.  Had I been a beginner I would have learned about source use at Yale, but this class was not my first introduction to these resources. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an amazing overview of 20th-century American history. It traced the rhetoric used by politicians and activists to advocate for their ideologies, as well as the ways those ideologies changed. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about 20th century american history, and how to use the plentiful library resources at Yale when looking at topics in American history. ",
            "\u00a0I think an understanding of party realignment theought the century was an excellent way to track and incriproate lots of material. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to work in the archives of Sterling and how to navigate the Congressional records. I also learned how to write a 12 page research paper and how to acknowledge the contradictory aspects of our history. I was surprised by how much I did not know about the American twentieth century that I learned in this class. ",

I went into the course thinking that I knew most of what was going to be taught, but Prof. Gage managed to organize the class in such a way that allowed us to go into certain topics in great depth and also trace key themes.

This really put me in a tough position for studying for the final because I tend to just listen during lecture and take sparse notes, and use the slides to review. This detail of the class really did not set me up for success. ",

My TA Salon Bhaman was great at engaging in deeper analysis of the material. Unfortunately, the lectures almost always went overtime, with the beginning being long winded and the end being super rushed. I felt that the decades of the 80s and 90s were overlooked, whereas there was way too much time spent on the New Deal. ",

            "\u00a0I felt that some of the reading assignments were excessive. I sometimes felt compelled to skim readings rather than really engage in them, and I sometimes felt that this took away from learning interesting details. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were a good balance of specific information and broader structure, and provided a good grounding for the weekly readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great, and the readings also paired together nicely. Professor Gage is really knowledgable and was very easy to understand. Her no laptop's policy is pretty outdated -- especially for people like me who have trouble keeping up with handwriting notes. Other than that great class. ",

She is the best lecturer I have had at Yale (I am a STEM student, so I guess that's not a terribly high bar to meet but still) and was an absolute delight during lectures. Her obsession with Hoover was endearing and she was incredibly open and helpful during office hours as well. The weakness of this class is the workload. I was in the WR section and had to do weekly reading responses, three writing assignments, a 15 page final paper, a midterm AND a final. Perhaps those in the WR section could do away with having to do a final, instead having to do longer writing assignments throughout the term and a slightly longer final paper. Another weakness of the class was its (lack of) clarity regarding assignments. The expectations for each assignment varied greatly between teaching assistants and there was no rubric to guarantee standardisation across sections which proved to be problematic when looking at the grade distributions.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Gage is one of the best history lecturers I've had at Yale. the course is so well organized and excitingly taught. the readings were very engaging and not unnecessarily long.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the essay assignments were at-times frustrating. very big disparity in how different TAs graded.

It was a little frustrating to have some of the lectures done by TFs, because they were not as well organized or as clear speakers as Professor Gage, which made the material covered in their lectures less accessible.

            "\u00a0The strength of  this course was how it forced students to engage with the library resources and to understand a general timeline of 20th century history. The weakness was that it mostly focused on one particular perspective of history, specifically it was very political party/ideology oriented and skipped some key events of the 20th century such as the Korean War or the Suffrage movement. ",

The writing assignments were also really cool, because they were focused in structure (e.g. analyzing any document from a specified set of primary source collections) but open-ended in topic. The workload was above-average -- the weekly reading responses were a lot. ",

            "\u00a0I think one thing that could be changed is that the midterm fell more in the middle of the semester so that there isn't so much material just on the final. The 1960s are complicated! The short writing assignments were pretty easy, though sometimes the TFs expected too much from 2-3 pages. ",

Instead of focusing on main takeaways, sometimes the course devolves into throwing a bunch of events and dates out in lecture without focusing as much on analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: There are just three, three page papers. They are not time-consuming, but it isn't clear exactly what they want from us. It was one-part historical analysis and one-part personal anecdote about our experience. Problem is, with just 2-3 pages, you can't do much of either. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Very solid, don't have any suggestions besides that I only wish that we had focused a little less on the inclusion of Yale into the historical narrative (would be interesting in smaller tidbits) and a little more on the nuances of social movements (talk about Malcolm X, maybe?). ",
            "\u00a0I thought the assignments were very well thought out, and perfect for a first-year who is thinking about majoring in history (or really any other major). I say this as a junior. The midterm felt very rushed to complete in 50 minutes, maybe reduce it to 4 IDs and an essay instead of 5 IDs! I also appreciated some of the teaching fellow lectures, however one of them was really not well organized. I think Professor Gage should vet the TF lectures before they are given. Also, some of the assigned chapters for the books were not released until the weekend before the section on that reading. The assigned chapters need to be released on the syllabus for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really really like this class! It was definitely fast paced, but I appreciated how Professor Gage and the TAs focused more on themes and trends than specific events and dates. The assignments were really fun and interesting. I like how we could choose to write about whatever topic we liked. I appreciated having the workshops to help with the assignments. I think that maybe the only thing I would change is the final exam. I think it would have been better and more interesting to have a final paper instead. It would have helped be synthesize the material more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught well. I would like to see every lecture be made by professor Gage as opposed to some teaching fellows. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured very well overall. Prof. Gage does a great job fitting a lot of information into 50-minute segments. It would be nice if her lecture slides were on Canvas for test review, and for people like me who have to miss a few classes over the course of the semester for athletics-related travelling. At times the information presented in the course also felt slightly biased towards a certain set of political views, more so regarding the TA guest lectures than Prof. Gage's lectures. Still a very worthwhile experience, though. ",
            "\u00a0Gage is a great professor and so knowledgeable. Lectures were great and fun to go to. However the class really did feel like a survey. Although this is inevitable given the broad scope of the class, I did not always feel like we were digging as deep as one should in a normal Yale course. This may have been due to a lack of engagement with section where these opportunities would have been more clear. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't have a great TF/section experience. Although my TF was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, he treated section more as a chance to lecture and teach, than as a chance for students to discuss the readings and lectures in greater depth. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, this is a lecture covering a huge span of time so naturally not everything can get covered, but I felt like some topics got heavy coverage while other events that were significant to American history (ex: the Korean war, the US's reaction to the Bosnian war) were completely glossed over. I would have preferred maybe a more even distribution of coverage on different events in American history. ",
            "\u00a0The course can be a bit challenging in terms of pace for students who have never taken American History before ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lie in the syllabus and Professor Gages lectures. She is really good at staying neutral on controversial issues and is drivers engaging talks. The major weakness is in the fact that I dont think we covered enough political history and spent a bit too much time on social movements. For example, I think we could have spent more time on the Vietnam War and less on talking about more minor social movements. The guest lectures by the TAs were also really poor. ",
            "\u00a0Please post the lecture slides ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures in this course, and I liked the Professor. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its organization. Lectures are very clearly structured and it is easy to determine what specific topics and skills are supposed to be learned throughout the course. The weakness of the course are the contents of some the readings. Usually there was 1 reading per week that seemed somewhat misplaced from the content of the surrounding lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gage is a very engaging lecturer and was able to cover lots of material in a way that felt accessible and well-structured. More clarity in some of the writing assignments could be helpful as there were times when I wasn't totally sure how best to approach such short assignments. ",

The biggest weakness was the ban of computers in section but making all the readings online. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best lecture I have been to at Yale. The pace is consistent and the slideshows are easy to follow and very interesting. Im not sure I was a fan of the type of writing assignments we had, as I am typically in favor of the standard analytic essay. It was often unclear what was expected from our short papers, and as a result the grading at times felt unfair. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was Prof. Gages lectures - they were very engaging and I liked the no-laptop policy. I also enjoyed our sections discussions. The courses weakness was in some of the TFs guest lectures - sometimes they went too fast and skimmed over really interesting topics (especially feminism and gay rights). ",

            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were engaging and fun, but didnt feel they went in depth covering the the political changes throughout the 20th century. I thought these would be covered in section, but we rarely discussed the actual political shifts I thought we would cover. ",
            "\u00a0I found the lecture to be very engaging, and Professor Gage had a very clear way of explaining historical events and their place in relation to broader themes. I also found that the readings were generally relevant and made for a fruitful discussion in section, though they were at times long and difficult to grasp. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: short papers are a great way to engage, loved the assignment of going to manuscripts and archives so I was less afraid of using that resource, really enjoyed the lectures.\r\n\r\nWeakness: When you have a course that covers so much material, it is helpful if the TA's put together a list of terms at the end to make it easier to study. The instructors kept saying that the IDs on the midterm and final would be \"pretty obvious\", but they were actually quite a bit more obscure than implied. ",
            "\u00a0The course focused a lot on domestic policy, so it perhaps could have focused more on foreign policy as well.  Additionally, some of the topics felt overly rushed and pointless because the course was trying to cover so much. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantasticProf. Gage is very engaging, and she has such a deep knowledge of the material. The readings were also very well-selected. The short assignmentsthree 2-3 page paperscould have been improved. They felt a bit like hand-holding to me (you had to take a selfie while doing research in the stacks as part of one of them), and I think they could have been more fulfilling. Perhaps it could have been a requirement that they all concern the same subject? In some ways, it would have been easier if they had been thesis-driven because the expectations for these assignments were a bit unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Beverly Gage!!! she's such an engaging lecturer and truly an expert in her field. I was always so amazed how she was able to clarify larger themes among specific historical examples while at the same time, crafting an overarching narrative that connected the themes/specifics/etc. together in a way that wasn't dogmatic. \r\nWeaknesses: the tests. My goodness, please please please post the slides next time. I went to every single lecture, took pretty meticulous notes, and attended section, but when it came time to take the tests, I was SO lost. I had such a hard time studying for them because there was no outline or timeline or ID list. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth was a strength, especially for international students. The writing assignments also made me much better at research skills. ",

But then again, I also really like survey classes because I prefer to have a general understanding of a lot of things rather than an in-depth understanding of something super narrow in scope. I liked how we were able to get up to the year 2000; the course started with Populism in the 1900s and ended with the year some of us were born. The grading is also not bad. As long as you do the readings, which are totally manageable, and go to the lecture, you'll be fine. Be warned that Prof Gage does not post her lecture slides on Canvas. You must go to the lecture, but that won't be a problem because you'll enjoy going. Also, no laptops in lecture. I think I actually took better notes because I didn't write down everything she said word-for-word, which forced me to think and summarize the most important things when writing things down. ",
