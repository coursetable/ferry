My thinking on issues covered in this course have gone through a complete evolution since the first class in August and I feel that I am able to better articulate myself, both verbally and in writing, on issues of sexuality, gender, health and human rights as a result of this course. ",

            "\u00a0the size of the course was a big strength because it fostered deeper discussion. \r\nit might be improved with even more small group discussion, though I think it depends on the group each year what they will engage with. ",

She keeps discussion on track, raises critically important questions, guiding the conversation around important themes, and keeps students on point with how language can shape our understanding of sexuality, gender and health within human rights.
