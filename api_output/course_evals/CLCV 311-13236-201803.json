            "\u00a0A great survey of Ancient Egypt, but with a very thematic focus on environment. Lots of primary/source texts. ",

            "\u00a0How to analyze history instead of spitting it back up, Egypt was a dynamic civilization and not a static one ",

            "\u00a0I developed the ability to discuss archaeological finds, as well as a breadth of knowledge of ancient Egyptian history. ",

            "\u00a0Great survey course of Ancient Egypt. Having known almost nothing about the period and initially believing it constituted a static history, this course presented a fascinating look at the Ancient Egyptian world. Would absolutely recommend for those seeking a captivating history lecture! ",
            "\u00a0Good course ",
            "\u00a0A little bit disorganized but v interesting and informative if you keep up with the readings ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and covered a topic that I knew nearly nothing about. However, the 4000 year time period covered, as well as the nature of the sources, meant that it was very difficult to actually feel that I went beyond surface level engagement with any particular facet of the subject covered in the course. There was so much material over so much time that I felt that I couldn't actually learn or synthesize it to an acceptable degree. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures, but readings are often too dense.  Sections tend to vary immensely in content. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would tell them to focus more on the readings than the lectures ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you must have an interest in both history and archaeology.  This is not a purely historical course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students because it explores many aspects of ancient Egyptian life. It is also very interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student.  Ancient Egypt is an underrepresented field in the History Department, and Professor Manning's lecture is an excellent introduction to the subject. "
