            "\u00a0I developed theory building skills, empirical approaches, and formal-theoretic analyses in one class. On topic wise, IPE included a broad spectrum of subjects that help students develop relevant knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to international political economy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about the major debates and future directions of the field of IPE. I know can better read regression tables and am more able to criticize quantitative observational and empirical research designs and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that this course covered a broad range of subjects within IPE. I feel like I got a general sense of the major contemporary debates regarding international trade, its influence on domestic economics and politics, environmental regulation, and other IPE-relevant topics.

            "\u00a0In this course, students could interact with Professor Queralt in a very accessible manner. He read all response papers without exception, and encouraged students to participate in the discussion. That way every student could focus on each session and learn more by checking how their initial thoughts manifested in response papers were percolated into the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Students presented the readings each week. While I get the value of this, it sometimes seemed to make the discussion stilted. I might recommend trying to have the presentation be less formal and shorter. ",
            "\u00a0Student presentations were usually thorough, but sometimes less productive. I absorbed a lot of material by having to explain it, but I still don't feel comfortable saying I fully understand any of the IPE papers. I would have loved Didac to teach one or two classes about the various methods used in IPE and what we should be aware of when reading the papers. ",
            "\u00a0The course didn't introduce any of the basic trade theories and seemed more focused on research design and presentation skills, rather than substance. \r\n\r\nCourse expectations were not clear. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course because Didac chose thought-provoking readings that stimulated lively discussion. I wish that he had not required students to present papers for the entire 2 hours. Class would have been even stronger if the presentations last 40 minutes total (10 minutes per paper) and discussion led by Didac for the remainder. The workload with doing reading response papers every week was a bit onerous, as it did not give me time to start my final paper until the end of the course. Maybe require 3 reading responses total over the course of the semester? ",
            "\u00a0The range of subjects within IPE surveyed in the course was very helpful. However, as someone with limited background in IPE (and economics more generally), I felt like I was definitely plunged into the deep end and did not have the conceptual knowledge to get the most out of the early weeks of the class. Some of the students gave a cursory introduction to fundamental concepts (eg, the Ricardo-Viner and Hecksher-Ohlin trade models) that was helpful, but the course could have benefitted from an introductory session that gave us some more of the tools to get the most out of the assigned readings.

            "\u00a0If they're interested in trade or research design. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. The workload was a bit onerous, but the class discussions were very interesting and Didac is a great instructor. I did not expect to enjoy IPE, but to my surprise I did! ",
            "\u00a0I would, though with the caveat that because the subjects change from week to week, how interesting it is will vary based on the readings and the person's individual interests. "
