            "\u00a0This course exposed us to almost every single corner of capital markets, from ABS to sovereign debt restructuring. VERY useful material for anyone getting into finance, whether it is into sell side, buy side, equity or debt. ",
            "\u00a0Good knowledge of DCM ",
            "\u00a0This was a course in fixed income pricing, capital market instruments, and derivatives pricing. I gained a really quantitative understanding into the way that bond traders and those that work in structured products carry out their work, as well as learned how capital markets work. ",
            "\u00a0A strong overview of various debt instruments and securities. ",
            "\u00a0Lot of knowledge about fixed income and non-equity markets. Really interesting content and exposure to broad swatch of the finance industry from a true expert. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper knowledge of the functions, size and scope, and layout of capital markets. These relationships between financial institutions are way more extensive and large than I had previously understood, and the insights that Prof Gorton shared are ones that I was enlightened by. I developed a skill to communicate about these markets more fluently and understand these institutional relationships more closely. "

            "\u00a0The course materials are clear especially the lecture notes. I like the online recordings quite a lot. However, I would appreciate to receive more prompt and detailed feedback if possible. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a lot of material. The six case studies forced us to engage with the topics in a more \"hands on\" manner, which was great. Although I understand that for some of the topics we were just exposed to the \"tip of the iceberg\", I could definitely realize by the end of the semester which areas I am more interested on (within the overall theme of the class).

            "\u00a0Great notes ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the course moved very fast, so they covered a lot of material every week. The support for the homework problems and office hours could have been improved. Cases were challenging, since there was not much guidance given. ",
            "\u00a0Really well taught course, could be a bit more helpful to have more structured notes but there is a lot of extremely useful material. Also a bit more guidance on the cases as to expectations at the outset may have been helpful but we all got the hang of things pretty quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of ground, but it also moved so quickly that it was difficult to keep up. "
