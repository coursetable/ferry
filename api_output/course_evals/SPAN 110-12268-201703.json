            "\u00a0Basic introductory level Spanish ",
            "\u00a0Although some of my classmates entered this class with high school spanish experience or even AP background, I began not knowing a word of spanish. So, of all my classes at Yale thus far I would say that in this class I definitely learned the most. It was very fast-paced and within a week I was already having conversations (beginner) in spanish! I learned how to use new grammar concepts and vocabulary both in real-life and on paper. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Spanish ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Spanish vocabulary and grammar necessary to continue learning Spanish. Participating in class and asking the professor for help when I needed it helped improve my Spanish throughout the semester. Reading and writing also reinforced the knowledge gained for each unit. ",
            "\u00a0Was able to re-learn spanish that I had forgotten from high school. Also learned more vocabulary and how to carry out conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained basic Spanish speaking, writing and listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the proper ways to speak, read, and write spanish. I learned introductory Spanish phrases and vocabulary, past and present tense, and different grammatical rules of the language. ",
            "\u00a0definitely mastered the basics of speaking Spanish by the time the course ended. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of how to speak, read, write and understand Spanish grammatically and conversationally and how to describe daily activities. "

            "\u00a0I thought this course was extremely well-designed. We covered a lot just in one semester, and I was surprised that I could carry my own in a conversation in Spanish even though I'd never been exposed to it before taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the workload was very manageable, even though we had homework everyday. The professor was very helpful in class and was always open to answering questions. Having the syllabus completely planned beforehand was really helpful in organizing the work for this class. \r\nThere weren't really any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course laid a good foundation for the language. It could be improved by incorporating more hands-on and visual activities in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included there being a lot of practice opportunities. I think that this course could be improved by implementing more \"fun\" Spanish activities that get students more involved in class.88 ",
            "\u00a0I was pretty good at reading and understanding spanish when it was spoken or written, but writing and speaking in the language itself was sometimes more difficult because you have to be aware of more elements in grammar and vocab rather than just piecing together the general idea from a text or sentence. "

            "\u00a0I would not. ",
            "\u00a0They should be willing to put in the work because this class does require a lot of effort. ",
            "\u00a0If you are trying to learn spanish for the first time, this course might be difficult because it seems to be slightly catered around those who have already taken spanish ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student. This is a well-designed introductory course to Spanish, and you will learn a lot of vocabulary and grammar in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good course for beginning Spanish speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are deciding on which language to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This course gives students a great introduction to the Spanish language and helps prepare students for further Spanish learning and fluency. ",
            "\u00a0definitely, it is a great course to take if you want to begin learning Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are starting out with little to no spanish experience L1 is the best course to take, and it will help you learn the fundamentals. "
