            "\u00a0The course is great. I liked approaching history from various angel and through diverse narratives. I liked how material often thought of as marginal can help weave a more comprehensive historical narrative ",
            "\u00a0I thought that Prof Toorawa gave us a good balance of primary and secondary material, giving due attention to the particulars (works, authors) and to the impulse to situate those particulars in important concepts (e.g. \"adab\"), greater trends (e.g. from oral/aural to textual), or broader views of meaning an history (e.g. an Islamic Golden Age?). These are impulses which he showed to be active then as now. It was this attention to the mechanics on which our knowledge of Medieval Baghdad is based that I most appreciated about this course. Here, Prof Toorawa's fascination with Ibn al-Nadim's Fihirist was contagiousit provided a fantastic backbone for the course and an enduring exemplar of organization as itself constitutive of meaning. But I also appreciated Prof Toorawa's attention to the mechanics of contemporary scholarship, and his attention to translation and the production of scholarly editions. It was an initiation into the field, not only the topic. This was helpful and exciting to me as a young scholar in a new field. \r\nIt is difficult to address the weaknesses of this course apart from its limitations as an undergraduate course and as a one-semester introduction to such a broad topic as Medieval Baghdad. It is easier for me to think about next steps. We went quickly through a large amount of primary material; I feel the need now to spend more time on lessto give the works introduced a deeper reading in their original languages and to better understand the state of knowledge regarding them as represented in a wider pool of secondary material. Overall, an excellent course and a solid foundation for future work. "
