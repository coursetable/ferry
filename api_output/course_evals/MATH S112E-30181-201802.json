            "\u00a0I was able to learn about the real calculus which I was not able to take it in my senior year. Even though the course was really challenging for me since I only took until pre-calculus, I tried my best to keep up with the concepts every class. I spend a lot of time outside of class and used many different type of sources to understand better about the concept. As a result, I was able to learn about the derivative and integral, and after the course, I was even able to help my friends on their AP Calculus. "
