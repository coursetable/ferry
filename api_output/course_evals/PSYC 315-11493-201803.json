The course covers many psychological phenomena relating to the human unconscious and why they occur.

            "\u00a0Great lectures and interesting content. I thought the second half of the course was a little repetitive (repeating the same studies over and over again), so maybe this could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very, very straightforward. Professor Bargh walks the class through every important concept multiple times, and the tests always reflect exactly what was taught. They don't even really require any memorization because the tests always include the name of the study and a basic summary of what the study was about before asking any questions on it, so as long as you went to the lecture or read the book (or got someone's notes) you will be completely set. Professor Bargh's book is also really entertaining and very similar to the lecture, so it's a fun read to reinforce the lecture information before the test, but reading it is probably not essential. There's no discussion section (the TA's do hold office hours though), so it is a very low time commitment, but that does mean you're pretty much on your own in making sure you understand the material (which is not difficult). At times, the lectures can get a bit slow, but I found Professor Bargh to be a very likable, interesting, accomplished instructor and I liked attending the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well done, I just think some of the central themes could be emphasized a bit more in addition to all the evidence that support these themes. ",

            "\u00a0Interesting content but the lectures were sometimes hard to follow and the grade only rides on two assessments, which can be a lot of pressure. If you consistently go to class, read his book, and make sure to study, the tests are manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting, though how topics were connected could have been explained more clearly. Also it was confusing when one piece of evidence was used for many many different units; in all sometimes it was hard to understand distinctions between separate theories/topics (which is fine because there are no discrete categories in our actual mind, but made it harder to explain on tests) ",
            "\u00a0Considering it only has two tests, it was nice to be able to focus on the material but that did make me concerned with how my grade would turn out. But then I took it Credit/d and that turned out perfectly because then I was able to focus on my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a pretty standard Psychology course, so no major weaknesses except maybe more engaging lectures. I appreciate getting out early though and the detailed review of each experiment during lecture. One thing I did wish was addressed more is how the studies are viewed in the present day, especially given the replication crises and how old some of the studies were. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main strength of the class is simply how interesting and relevant the material is. Lectures were very engaging, and we learned about stuff like how holding coffee can make you perceive someone else as more socially warm. I would have liked for the lectures to incorporate more data and neuroscience. Many of the findings are cool, but Professor Bargh rarely went in depth about the evidence or neurological underpinnings for these processes. While I appreciate that lectures werent too technical, I think we could have gone a little more below the surface. Another facet of the class to be aware of is that the exams are pretty much entirely memorization-based. Its definitely a manageable amount to memorize, but just be aware that you wont be doing much critical thinking or analysis. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of the conscious and unconscious aspects of the mind. I don't see much room for improvement in the class, although maybe less of a focus on the history of psychology (Skinner/Nicer, etc.) and more on contemporary research. Strong course overall! ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Bargh is a great lecturer and makes lectures interesting to go to.  This class goes over a lot of thought-provoking topics and interesting studies. Although the second half gets a little repetitive, I thought it was still an excellent psych class. If you go to class and study the lecture slides for the midterm and final, you'll get a good grade and don't need to do any additional work. ",
            "\u00a0If they want to correctly understand human behavior, including their own, then yes. This class is more applicable to economics than economics courses at Yale, as it shows how irrational human beings are, and it shows how our economics program exemplifies many problems with education in itself, slow-moving and failing to be pertinent with the times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to someone who is interested in psychology and its social effects but does not want to spend lots of time doing outside work, this class is perfect. I'm very glad I took it. Although it is not considered an entry-level course, I had never taken a psych class in my life when I took this class (it was my first semester at Yale in fact), and it required absolutely no background knowledge. As long as you show up to lecture (which absolutely always gets out early), and you take notes, you will be completely set for the midterm and final, which are the only two graded components of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because throughout the course and still now I still see parallel's between the course content and my own life. Things I have learned in this course have helped explain some of my own judgements and decisions and have helped me see some of the way in which I am biased without realizing it, and helped me think a little more rationally.

            "\u00a0I don't recommend this class. Professor Bargh may be a giant in his field, but he struggles to lecture with any structure and cannot adequately communicate important general themes. It is also unacceptable to tell students, in a class in which two exams make up a student's course grade, that they should not worry about the intricacies of studies for exams, and then proceed administer exams with 20% or more of the questions being of that EXACT manner. ",
            "\u00a0yes, definitely ",
            "\u00a0Wouldn't really recommend. Teaching was lackluster, basically just repeating the same themes over and over. Feel like I didn't really learn much, but I did find the material itself at least somewhat interesting as factoids, but not much else. ",
            "\u00a0It's ok. Could be a super low workload 5th credit class, but just be aware that the tests are important if the grade is still based on 50% midterm and 50% final. Take it credit D if you're worried about not doing well. ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting class to those interested in psychology ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would. I think it would be very beneficial for other students to understand a phenomenon that has been shown to dictate and have a great influence on nearly everything we do in life. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very interesting class, so I'm glad I took it. But, it might be better to credit-D it, unless you're fine with the stress of just multiple choice tests, each worth half your grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its good for people who are curious and also applicable to life ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but take it credit/d. Then you are not concerned about your grade and can focus on enjoying the class without stressing too much over the two tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a pretty standard Psych lecture, and the same format as Prof. Bargh's other courses. If you can appreciate his lecture style, then I would definitely recommend this course. He's very knowledgeable about the course material and can make lecture engaging in that sense, but it may also feel somewhat dry or fast-paced. The lectures were usually only an hour long, which I appreciated because I could get lunch before my next class. I personally found this course extremely easy -- if you just come to class and take detailed notes and review them the day before exams, you should do fairly well. The exams were composed of pretty simple multiple choice (everything comes from lecture, you just need to know the main concepts and the studies) and some harder short answer questions. If you can thematically study anything as a potential \"list\" type question, then it'll probably be a short answer. I found the actual content of this course pretty interesting and somewhat similar to social psych but definitely still worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Even if you arent studying psychology, the findings Professor Bargh discusses in lecture will relate to your life in some way. He takes a very integrative approach, demonstrating the intersection of research with issues like gender biases, race discrimination, philosophy, political leanings, etc. You should note that the course grade is composed of 50% midterm grade and 50% final grade. These exams are totally fair and memorization and lecture-based, and, as long as you do what youre supposed to (like come to lectureswhich are great anyway!), you will do well. I really enjoyed that we were only assessed on the exams, since it meant that I didnt have to write any extra papers or do weekly assignments. Plus there is no section. One more thingif you take the class, definitely buy and read Professor Barghs book. It summarizes the material in a way that's succint and helpful, especially before exams. Again, would really recommend! ",
            "\u00a0No, professor Bargh is not a nice professor. He is condescending to students. His lecture slides are horribly disorganized and impossible to follow. Midterm grade, which is 50% of the grade, comes back after the drop deadline.. so you dont know how youre doing until its too late. Unfortunate class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It's a great overview of all the unconscious processes and influences taking place in the brain. Bargh is an expert in the field and an engaging lecturer. He incorporated current events into his teaching, which made the class more relevant. This class really opened my eyes to how my own mind works and how little control I actually have over a lot of my perception and actions. Not much work (straight midterm/final) if you keep up with lectures and are genuinely interested in the material, but not a gut either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Could be an interesting course for someone who hasn't taken any other class in psychology. "
