            "\u00a0Chinese 110 definitely focuses on constant exposure to written and spoken forms of Mandarin. That constant exposure has made me more comfortable in reading, writing, and speaking Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0a whole lot of chinese. More than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Chinese culture and formed the basis of conversational Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I learned how to come communicate in Chinese at a basic level quite we'll. My listening, writing, and speaking skills in Chinese have improved considerably by taking this course ",
            "\u00a0I really strengthened my Chinese, and did a great deal of expanding my vocab.  I also started to pick up on the tones (which we pretty much just ignored in high school, and the moment when I stopped having to pay attention to each individual tone and started doing it more as second nature was insanely satisfying.

            "\u00a0The program seems very well put together, as though the kinks have been worked out slowly over time. It requires a lot of dedication, especially memorizing dialogues, but I agree that this kind of memorization really helps students remember what they need to. If I had to suggest something for improvement, I would say that perhaps encouraging more outside of class activities so that students new to Chinese might be able to meet the Chinese community at Yale better. ",
            "\u00a0The great thing about Chinese 110 is that it forces students to be constantly engaged with the language by having daily quizzes and weekly assignments like passage memorization or speaking with a TA. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes were annoying, but really forced you to prepare. This course requires a lot outside of the classroom, but it's pretty much effort-in effort out. ",
            "\u00a0The immersive class time is wonderful. The only change would be regarding the oral test. I often felt I got questions wrong just because I didn't understand the computer. ",
            "\u00a0The course really helped build a working Chinese vocabulary--I feel as though I can handle myself in a pretty good number of situations, which I'm super happy with given how short the course was.  I really enjoyed how we rotated between professors, since I feel like we were able to build meaningful relationships with all of them. The course's organizational structure was a little confusing at first (there's a website and two different canvas courses that we receive information from) but that was mostly in the first couple weeks of the course and I feel like it wouldn't be a problem going forward.  I wish there was a way we could have more/longer conversations, since I feel like using the language dynamically instead of following a script really helped me.  Overall, though, I thought it was a fine class. ",
            "\u00a0The teachers made sure we were very engaged and involved in class. However, I did not necessarily have a great experience with my TA in terms of learning Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0The its course's quick pace is both its strength and downfall. While you definitely learn the language, if you do not keep up, you can quickly fall behind. "

All of the  put a a lot of effort into the class, and although it can be a lot at times, they understand and help as much as they can. ",
