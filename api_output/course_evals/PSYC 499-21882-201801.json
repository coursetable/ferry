            "\u00a0I've learned so much throughout my research experience, but taking PSYC 499 in particular made me learn how to communicate my research findings. Writing the senior essay was my first time writing a full length empirical report on research that i had done. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot during my senior essay. It is an independent project and a chance to dive deep into one area of Psychology. It was a great way to end my senior year because it gave me a brief chance to see what academic research is like. ",
            "\u00a0Application of my previous research methods course, independent research skills such as designing my own experience, recruiting and running participants, data collection and management, analysis of results, development of writing skills ",
            "\u00a0Organization, time management, innovative thinking, data analysis ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about R statistical software, research practices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct my own research and write a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount in this class. I was able to conduct research, and turn that research into a scientific paper, so I feel like I got to experience a, slightly abbreviated, version of the entire research process. I learned how to research, work with participants, analyze data, and communicate it to others. Overall this was a good culmination of the psychology major. ",
            "\u00a0This helped to give me a glimpse of what graduate school would be like ",
            "\u00a0Independent research with advisor ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct my own research, navigate the responsibilities of being a research assistant in a fast-paced lab, and gained confidence in my ability to design projects, carry them out, conduct analyses and present my results. "

            "\u00a0Overall, I think that the course is very flexible and dependent on each PI and student's relationship. I think if there were more stringent deadlines about when outlines and first drafts are due (for all students), that might be beneficial. In my case, I was doing a lot of research for other projects in our lab, and I left the actual write-up for my senior project until the last minute. So if I had a hard deadline for a first draft, I think that would've helped me not procrastinate. ",
            "\u00a0Your project depends on your advisor. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great opportunity to conduct independent research as a senior. The experience seems to depend greatly on the advisor, so choose carefully. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-organized way of completing the senior thesis. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good at giving me a good idea of the research process and lifestyle. It gave me the opertinity to fail and try again, as well as work in a team with other researchers. At times I wish I had a little more guidance, or another class to prepare me for the final paper, but overall I think I got a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Challenging but rewarding ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0I think that the requirement for weekly lab hours for senior essay students should be standard across labs. My fellow seniors and I felt stretched extremely thin in the spring semester trying to work on our senior essays for several hours per week in addition to our required RA lab hours. We spoke with our lab manager about this and she was really understanding and was able to adjust our hours to include time to work on our research projects, such as entering data on lab computers and working on our analyses. This slight adjustment helped us tremendously in the last few weeks of the semester, when we were working extra hard wrapping up our projects. "

            "\u00a0If you love your research, then no question, take this class. You're going to get class credit and senior requirement for doing something that you love. But if your heart's not in research, just write the senior essay in a senior seminar. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this if you are a Psych major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This is a wonderful opportunity to take ownership of a research project. I have gained so much experience from this course, and I am glad that I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend doing an empirical thesis through the Psychology department! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend doing a senior essay as a research project! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is the way to go for psych! Conducting your own research so so cool and fulfilling! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. It is a great way to both see if the research lifestyle is something you are interested in, as well as explore aspects of psychology that you are truly interested in. After four years of psych classes, I fee like I got to dive deeper into an area of study that truly interested me in a way I previously hadnt been able to. ",
            "\u00a0Required for BS degrees. Start early and dont cheat the process ",
            "\u00a0Depends on your relationship with your advisor and interest in the project ",
            "\u00a0I chose to conduct my own research for the senior requirement because I wanted to gain research experience and also in the event that I choose to pursue a graduate degree in psychology. I thought this was a great way to gain research experience and a lot of confidence in my ability to think critically about research and conduct my own as well. I learned a lot from the graduate students in the lab, my PI, our lab manager, and my fellow RAs! I would definitely recommend this path for anyone interested in conducting psychological research. "
