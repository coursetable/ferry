Changed assignment instructions few hours before due date. \r\nCannot bear and complain even more about this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: this course provides an overview of statistical methods that will be commonly used in public health research.\r\nWeakness: this course was taught by the instructor for the 1st time, and the contents of this course were not well organized. Homework has little to do with what was taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0The labs and assignments are very practical. I like the idea of writing abstracts to summarize the findings of each lab. But we need more instructive slides with clear explanations. Would like to have more teaching time rather than having 3 final presentation classes. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that there was often a disconnect between what was taught in class and what was expected on the homeworks from the textbook. It sometimes seemed that I was teaching myself from the textbook to answer the homework problems. I liked the final project for this class. It was a real world example of finding a dataset and doing an analysis and it really brought to light some overarching questions I have about conducting analyses that I had never realized since we had always been walked through things. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: \r\n1. The professor could make slides instead of writing. (time-consuming and sometimes we could not understand the handwriting)\r\n2. The homework can be more related to the learning materials in class. ",
            "\u00a0It focuses on the application of many regression methods, but not the underlying theories. The strength is that I can learn how to implement the methods and work on the real data. The weakness is I don't know much about the statistical theories and logic behind those methods. ",
            "\u00a0The course materials are great. ",
            "\u00a0The course is hard for a non biostat-based student. I do think professor E claus should improve the TA time. We found it not helpful sometimes. In the end, we do not go to TA hours. ",
            "\u00a0There was a disconnect between the lecture and assignments, but the topics covered were helpful. The final project is a good opportunity to do applied statistical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Delved deeply into various regression models.  No tests; only homework and project-based grade\r\nWeaknesses: Biggest gripe has to be the homework.  Often, questions were posed which were never introduced in class/were only loosely related to what we had covered.  In addition, what was covered in lab only occasionally made it to what was expected from lab assignments.  Often, much different code was needed in order to answer the question posed, and the only way to get this code was to have a TA essentially give it to you in office hours.  While homework should serve as a way to reinforce what was taught in class, oftentimes I felt like what we were tasked with doing was pointless and busy work.  I enjoyed lecture, but these exercises made this class into one of my least favorites at Yale due to the copious amount of hours spent and headaches that were induced by the homework.\r\nImprovements: Parse the homework down to material that was actually covered in class, and not focus on mathematical theories that were never even mentioned.  Make lab assignments follow what was covered in lab, with the access to code that provides the way to get to the answers being asked.  Don't pick textbook questions by randomly opening to a page and blindly pointing, as this feels how the majority of book questions were selected.  Also, consider adopting another textbook, as this one was a nightmare to work with (problems relying on problems from other chapters, which in turn would rely on problems from other chapters,  which came from something else in another chapter). ",
            "\u00a0Very difficult course with a lot of material. Does a good job at expanding student's SAS skills. Labs were useful but homeworks touch on material that was never covered in class. ",

            "\u00a0For me, the strength of the course was the final project, as it was a useful way to practice utilizing all the methods learning during the course.\r\nThe professor's teaching style was also a strength of the course - it was overall easy to follow (for most topics), and she did simplify a lot of hard concepts for optimal student understanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course: still confused as to whether there was more than one TA in the course, and was always confused regarding who to contact. \r\nThere were several issues with datasets needed for lab or homework being uploaded late to canvas. \r\nGrading feedback was terrible - homework max scores differed from HW to HW and there was no cumulative score indicated on the graded homework itself so students needed to add everything up and then guess the max points to figure out where they were on the grading scale. Basically grading felt like a guessing game.\r\nCanvas for this course was not easy to navigate, the deadlines for homework were hard to find (I once spent 15 minutes trying to find the part of canvas specifying this) - given the ease with which other courses manage to communicate deadlines, I don't understand why this was a problem.\r\nAnother weakness was that the homework problems were not similar to in class examples....and though there were multiple office hour opportunities, the TAs were not very helpful and confused themselves as to what the correct answer/suitable tactic for an analysis was. Basically, on the occasions where I couldn't figure it out myself, I found no help. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course since the workload was very intense. However, sometimes the workload was too intense. Taking notes from the lecture was far from sufficient to answer questions in the homework. Students needed A LOT OF self-learning to finish the homework. It would be much more helpful if there were more in-depth information provided in the lectures and labs. ",

            "\u00a0This course should be really interesting and useful. But the way the professor taught it was far beyond imagination. There was very unclear and limited class content, partially because of the unrecognizable handwriting. It would be better if the professor can use slides. Homework was not linked to the content covered in class at all. The TA led labs were pretty clear, straightforward and helpful. ",

            "\u00a0There is a lot of value in this course's subject matter. However there was a big disconnect between the parts of the course. What was covered in lecture was not what was on the homework, and completing the homework assignments required self teaching concepts from the textbook that were not mentioned in class. ",

            "\u00a0weakness: The homework did not reflect what we learned from the class. The examples given during the lecture is very simple, but the four homework assignments are hard and some of them are not related to the class materials. The questions on the last homework were poorly described, which make us very hard to understand without the instruction from TF. Overall, I feel that I did not learn much from this course. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is insteresting but the teaching style is somewhat confusing and less engaging. The expression of homework questions is also confusing and there is no consistent grading criteria. ",
            "\u00a0It is a hard class, the calculation is hard to understand, and sometimes, the homework is not very related to the stuff taught in the class, so that it requires some self-learning to finish the homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: presents a lot of concepts that are certainly applicable for future work, both in academics and in a professional field\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more depth over breadth. I feel like we only covered some topics at a surface level, and I rarely felt that what we learned in class was helpful for the homework. The homework was ridiculously difficult for this course, and office hours weren't very helpful either. The TA's all provided different answers to questions we posed, so it was more difficult than it should've been to receive guidance on course material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- Dr. Claus is an amazing instructor and is able to explain concepts beautifully.\r\n- I enjoyed the final project of applying regression analysis to a data set of our choice.\r\n- Lab PowerPoints were well-annotated and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- The homework assignments with textbook problems did not really align the the methods or level of detail we were exposed to in lectures. This made some problems discouragingly difficult and confusing. \r\n- The labs felt rushed when there was actually plenty of time.\r\n- Listening to every single person in this large lecture course present their final projects ended up being a chore to sit through due to the sheer number. ",
            "\u00a0The course materials cover helpful topics in order to conduct regression analysis. The final project and the labs were very helpful in practicing the concepts we learned in class. I think the course would be more useful if the homework assignments were more related to the lecture topics. The textbook problems were too difficult and I did not learn from them. ",
            "\u00a0This course should've been very interesting, but the instructor taught it in a way that push people who are interested in data analysis away.\r\nThe course is unstructured and unorganized. I feel what I learned from the class is very fragmented. The lecture is always shorter than its designated time, making our tuition not worthy of its value. The lecture is more like a quick overview of a topic. The instructor gives very easy examples in class but gives us very hard homework problems with the scope far beyond what is being taught. This is very unfair, because we need to spend (waste, to be exact) tons of time googling information that should've been brought up in the class to save our time and energy. For me, this is the worst kind of education, because students waste their time and gain nothing, doing pure labor just to pass the class. A complete nightmare. "

The instructor didn't effectively make use of the time. We paid tuition for valuable class but not for leisure time at YSPH. \r\n\r\n(2) Many important concepts in homework were not covered in class. Students had to look up for them on the textbooks or elsewhere. This is really a waste of our time. The instructor should have had enough time to cover these in the class.\r\n\r\n(3) The instructor changed her words frequently. Many time, her words were inconsistent with what we had in syllabus or handouts or even what she said previously. This caused a lot of confusion. It seems that the instructor couldn't remember what she had said or written. Students felt frustrated every time she changed the words. The instructor should be more consistent and professional.\r\n\r\n(4) The instructor made many errors in class. It appears the instructor didn't understand the basic statistics or teaching materials very well. Some are suspicious of her eligibility to teach in this class. \r\n\r\n(5) The instructor doesn't like innovation. She attempted to restrict students within a small scope and disliked those who tried new methods.\r\n\r\n(6) I felt a little bit uncomfortable sitting in the class.

She could and often easily disagreed with what she said in the previous announcement, and hence add extra work to us as students to meet her expectations. \r\n\r\n2. She does not utilize her lecture time efficiently. We only have her lecture every Monday from 3 to 4:50 pm, but we always end early at around 4 pm. Note that almost everyone has difficulty in doing her assignment, and that was because the knowledge needed for homework assignments were not covered in the lecture! I, therefore, cannot understand why we end class early everytime while we did not learn anything useful yet. \r\n\r\n3. She does not fully respect her students, especially minority students. It seems that Professor Claus has a pre-set assumption that students from a particular region would always be bad at doing practical work, and she therefore would always disagree with their ideas. \r\n\r\nOverall, I respect Professor Claus for her academic achievement, but I hardly appreciate her teaching ability and her personality.

There was one time that she requested that another lab abstract should be turned in just one hour before the deadline, and every student rushed to write the abstract like crazy. When we discussed project topics after class, she declined our projects hastily, and said it should be related to public health, never had been researched before, and the data should not be just downloaded from the internet. But on the next day in class, many of the passed topics did not reach this standard at all, one was not even related to public health. I think she tried very hard to make it difficult for students.

Sometimes we do not know why we are taken off points and arguing is nothing helpful. She and her grader do not seem to be concerned about our situations at all.\r\n\r\nShe does not fully used her class time. Every Monday she ends her class an hour early. And left us tons of homeworks including things she did not cover in class. Although it is good for us to learn things independently, for some coding issues, if you do not know what code can be used in some circumstances you will never know how to accomplish the task no matter how much searching work you do.\r\n\r\nShe is differently treating students.

            "\u00a0The instructor is not responsible enough for teaching. Her materials are not well prepared, and often use other professors'/PhD students' slides as her own lecture materials. Despite its legitimacy, it shows that she didn't put enough time to make her original contribution to this class. Even when she has her own slides, she made them in a way that is not very \"user friendly.\" Too many words on the slides, and her preferred color combination makes it very hard to see from behind. \r\n \r\nThe handwriting of the instructor is unreadable. Most students can't read her handwriting, and she's aware of it, but she keeps writing like that anyway. She said \"I am famous for my handwriting.\" And then laughed it off. To my knowledge, many students were unable to read her comments for their final project oral presentation. This, again, is not responsible and even not respectful for students. \r\n\r\nSometimes she fails to answer students' questions in an informative way. When a student asks A, she circumvents that question to answer B. It makes students doubt whether she knows the true answer to that question. \r\n\r\nThe instructor is capricious in her requirement for assignments. She constantly changes her requirement for assignments, making students very confused and frustrated. She said in class we didn't need to write an abstract for the lab but days later informed the TA that an abstract is required for the lab. It was not until the homework was almost due that we knew this. Everyone was in panic because the homework would be due in an hour. \r\n\r\nThe instructor is not clear on her instructions for lab, and later deduct points if certain requirements were not met. I hope every instruction should be written clearly on paper instead of informing orally in class, because students could miss that piece of information even if she/he is physically in class. \r\n\r\nThe instructor is persistent on her own way of dealing with things and doesn't encourage much innovation. She requires a poster for final presentation, but the poster turns out to be an 250 abstract. And then, the final write-up is also an 250 abstract. I can't see why that she wants us to do repetitive work. I thought a poster should contain more graphs, but our graphs have nowhere to add. "

            "\u00a0I think regression analysis is important for us biostats students, but somehow I feel that what I've learnt through the course was much less than I had expected. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Claus was an enjoyable lecturer but I would not recommend the class itself.  The homework takes much more time than is warranted and heavily relies on what I perceive as loosely related busy work.  The labs were easy to follow during class but then you were thrown to the wolves with lab assignments and had to get a TA to give you the code in order to finish correctly.  Only if the issues surrounding homework are fixed would I recommend this class. ",

Dr. Claus is a great instructor, so I would recommend visiting her during office hours. Start PSETs and labs early, because these can take forever and be the bane of your existence if you don't seek help from TAs. The textbook-based homework problems can feel disjointed from lectures, but lectures themselves are very helpful. ",
