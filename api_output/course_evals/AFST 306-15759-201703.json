            "\u00a0The second semester of this course consisted of wrapping up our work with our partner companies over the summer, as well as writing up case studies and teaching notes about our respective companies. In the process, we learned how to think critically about a social enterprise's mission, understand its strategic dilemmas, and use analysis to make recommendations on its business strategy. ",
            "\u00a0This course is about developing a case study and teaching note for the summer work component of AFST 305. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about supply chains, impact investing, and start ups and how they can have impact in Africa. ",
            "\u00a0Business and developing economies and how they impact poverty alleviation ",

        [
            "\u00a0We gained a comprehensive perspective of the landscape of social enterprise across industries, but it would have been helpful to get some more preparation for the technical skills required to work with companies. ",
            "\u00a0The course could use some more structure and classes focussed on developing case studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class was mostly meetings with the professor which was really helpful for your project. I liked that we could talk through the concepts that we were struggling with each week. ",
            "\u00a0More Structure ",
            "\u00a0THE SECond half of this course was basically an independent workshop for our case writeups. This actually turned out to be a lot of work, but we learned a lot through triall and error, which was quite frustrating at times. Overall, dont underestimate the amount of work the case will be, and you will learn more than you think from the hands on aspect of this class. "

            "\u00a0If you've gotten to this point, you have to take the class--its a good one, enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you're interested in social enterprises, or even just international development in general. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, taking AFST 305/306 has radically altered my perceptions of the role of market systems in combatting poverty. Bo is an incredible mentor and the overall experience one gains from class and the summer commitment, including producing a case study and teaching note, is invaluable and something I will cherish throughout my life. ",
            "\u00a0This class is required if you take 305, but the series is definitely worth it and I've learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, awesome alternative educational experience ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in social enterprise and market-based solutions to social issues. ",
            "\u00a0THIS Class offers a great opportunity to travel (basically for free) and produce tangible work for a client. You learn a little rom the experience and this is a fun departure from traditional classes. Nevertheless, the lack of structure can be really stressful and you are responsible for whats you gain from this class. Dont underestimate the overall workload, but its easier to be independent and schedule your homework for times that arent convenient for you. "
