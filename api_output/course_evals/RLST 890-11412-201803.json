            "\u00a0This course dramatically helped to improve the conscientiousness of my writing and my exposure to important texts. ",
            "\u00a0My sense of the field of religious studies, and especially the place which my own interests occupy therein, has improved greatly. More importantly, however, I developed my ability as a thinker, especially my capacity to push my own readings and insights to be more capacious, to overlook less. The weekly writing assignments were among the most productive I have ever been set. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar broadened my theoretical and historical understanding of Romanticism. It also exposed me to a variety of analytical tools that will aid my critical reading in areas far beyond the subject matter of the course. Perhaps most importantly, Noreen's leading of the discussion modeled critical approaches to the study of religion and critical theory, pushing us to read more closely and think more rigorously. As a consequence, our seminar felt like a running conversation amongst friends (without the distinction between Noreen as teacher and us as students being unduly erased), one that we students plan to continue. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an incredible amount from this course. I went from knowing almost nothing about romanticism to having a broad overview of major players and ideas. I also appreciated the connections drawn between romanticism, romance, and the novel (roman). The small size of the seminar gave us a lot of flexibility in deciding where to take the conversation each seminar, and I enjoyed getting to know each person and how they think on a level more profound than normal seminars. The intensive writing in the course enabled me to get comfortable with writing a lot, and regularly, but at the same time be more judicious about the words that I am putting on paper. Noreens extensive comments were immensely helpful, and the weekly writing exercises really allowed me to engage with the (often tough) readings at a much deeper level. Finally, the rigor of the course meant that I came to develop more structured study/reading habits in order to keep upsomething I hope to continue in future semesters. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredible engagement with our writing and attention to our ideas, as well as a structure to discussion which helped to facilitate in-depth engagement with the texts.\r\n\r\nFor Improvement: I'm not sure I can think of anything; this course was great for those who would be drawn to it. ",
            "\u00a0The low student count, the intense writing assignments, and the variety of readings were all strengths. ",
            "\u00a0The course exemplifies Noreen's brilliantly eclectic approach to the study of religion. With respect to Romanticism, the course introduced us to a variety of approaches, showing us the lay of the academic land, sacrificing nothing to conventional wisdom without underrating the importance of established voices (i.e., Hegel, Schleiermacher, Goethe). Reading across genres and critical orientations, we not only gained insight into \"Romanticism,\" but also persistently explored the stakes and possibilities of the study of religion. A small seminar was essential to this success, as it enabled us to engage deeply with each other's preparatory papers each week and to carry on a running conversation that was open-ended without being unproductively boundless, forming a community in the process (and in this respect this seminar on Romanticism may itself partake in the romantic imperative). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are definitely its small size and the extensive feedback we were able to get. The cap on the number of students meant that we were able to get to know each other a lot better, and could think with each other in a more productive way. We were also held accountable to each other, such that I dont think any of us would dream of slacking on the readings (because if we did we would do so at the detriment of the conversation in the seminar, which would negatively impact all of us). I dont really have much to say in terms of the weaknesses of the course, except perhaps to suggest lowering the expected word count of the weekly essays (for example, from 1200-1500 words to 1000-1500 words) to reduce the stress of juggling the readings with writing.

            "\u00a0Absolutely, if someone was interested in the history we studied. ",
            "\u00a0To any student interested in learning how to read and think, I would heartily recommend this or any other course Noreen is running. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If they are willing to put in the hours for the course, theyll get so much out of it (see response to question 1). This is a truly unique experience, and I cannot recommend the course enough. "
