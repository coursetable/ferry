            "\u00a0I learned so much about presidential campaigns and reporting on these since JFK from both the readings, which were excellent, and from listening to Professor Shapiro himself, who has so many interesting stories and anecdotes to share from his decades of experience as a writer and journalist. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the relationship between politicians, the media, and voters. I also learned about how the press has evolved as an institution over the past 50 years. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating analysis of campaign reporting since the days of Teddy White. You definitely enhance analytical skills and are able to better situate modern-day political reporting in a broader historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount in the political field. In particular, the presidential campaigns during the 20th century and the implications of each campaign. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I felt that some of the students in the seminar were not engaged and this sometimes made discussion rather repetitive and stunted. I wished that they would look up from their laptops and truly engage with Professor Shapiro and the rest of the class. However, I quickly learned that I did mind this so much as it allowed more time for Professor Shapiro himself to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the material and the professor.  Weaknesses is not enough time to fully engage with the entire body of work of political journalism attempted. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shapiro is a major strength. He gives great feedback and is always accessible. He has many amazing stories to share about his career. Class discussion can be repetitive at times and is not always the most stimulating but I still definitely enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Love the syllabus and guest lecturers; great class structure in general. Ensuring people do the readings and encouraging class participation definitely would help, but obviously difficult to enforce. Easy to engage in class and a pleasure to discuss the material with Prof Shapiro. ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths. The class was fun and engaging every week. Each week was different but connected to the main purpose of the course every time. There were also guest speakers every couple weeks that shed light on a new topic and field of study. It was a great course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think I would. Overall, I had a good time. The material is interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you are lucky enough to get in, take the class. The readings are informative and fascinating, and they are given context and color by the professor, whose decades of experience as a reporter covering presidential campaigns makes him the perfect person to teach this seminar. I don't think it's possible not to love Walter Shapiro, despite how Al Gore and co. may feel about him. Be sure to listen and take in and contribute as much as you can; I guarantee you will learn so much from and laugh amply because of Professor Shapiro, who is whip-smart, hilarious, humble, open-minded, thoughtful, profound, and wonderful. But please only take this course if you know you are going to really care about it, put in the effort, and pay attention in class. It will make the experience so much more worthwhile for yourself and for your peers.  I couldn't recommend it more highly. ",
            "\u00a0I would because the professor is awesome and the material is also critical for anyone who consumes media and politics today, regardless of major. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in presidential politics and the evolution of the press corps, this is a good class for you. Professor Shapiro is a sweetheart and super enthusiastic about the material. He has many great stories to share. The workload is very average. Class discussions aren't always extremely compelling and stimulating, but I liked it overall. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A wonderful senior seminar: engaging discussion, fascinating material, devoted professor. Campaign books are so much fun to read, and discussions of where the political media is going moving forward are crucial in any setting. Great foray into campaign reporting; one definitely gets more of a sense of the long history of the political media before the 2016 election. An awesome examination of political journalism and American politics more generally. Professor Shapiro is a gem: chock full of knowledge, very entertaining, and always willing to meet outside class hours to give advice/guidance to students. A wonderful teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. Great class that was very engaging and awesome to attend. 10/10 recommend. "
