            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its discussion-based focus and focus on methodologies and social issues that are relevant to a broad range of interests. I think that the course could strike a better balance between historical, seminal literature and more cutting-edge research to be discussed and read in class. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Bargh is engaging and the course units were interesting. However, I often found the lectures to be difficult to follow and it would have been nice if the format of the class had mandated discussion a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: not a lot of work; can learn about classic literature\r\nweaknesses: not much discussion if people don't read--maybe it's helpful to also organize other forms of interactions? ",
            "\u00a0The topics were all pretty great, although there was a TON of reading some days. There were several articles that were good but that were so repetitive that it became a little mind numbing. Drawing attention to specific paragraphs/sections/pages within the readings would help with the repetitiveness of some of them. \r\nI also feel like the lack of a specific talking point to start the lectures/discussions off of was a little detrimental, so it took some time for things to get going. I think providing one or two questions/statements to guide the thought processes so that we have a point of discussion to start from that is more focused than just e.g. \"stereotyping\" would help with discussions. \r\n\r\nOne other suggestion that I think might be valuable is if the context lecture that was often given at the beginning of the class with the talking points would be more beneficial at least for me if they occured at the end of the preceeding class period. So if we spent an hour and a half talking about the reading we had done over the past week and then the last half hour was spent giving the context for the upcoming reading. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had covered a wider breadth of topics on social cognition that included more neuroscience readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course brought together a wide range of research which was engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I think the course suffered from students not completing the readings beforehand. Perhaps adding a small assignment due before class would encourage more engaging class discussions. "
