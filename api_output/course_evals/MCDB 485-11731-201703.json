            "\u00a0Due all to my PI, Nadya Dimitrova, as well as graduate students and lab members, Clara Liao especially, I learned so much about immunohistochemistry this semester. I am becoming more and more comfortable in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skills at the bench (dissections, gels, PCRs, ect). I also better developed my organizational abilities, my ability to problem solve and think critically, and my knowledge of the subject that I am researching. I also learned a bit about NIH grant writing through the mid-year paper that was due in December. ",
            "\u00a0It's your first serious research project ",
            "\u00a0Working in a lab, writing grand proposals, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Laboratory project design, experimental techniques, troubleshooting skills, data analysis, presentation and science writing skills, and valuable interactions with other scientists. ",
            "\u00a0I continued working on my project in my lab, and I felt learned a lot of new lab skills and independence this semester. I've done 3 semesters of research before, so it was mostly the same as my previous experience. ",
            "\u00a0Lots. My research project required me to become intimate with types of protein visualization and microscopy I had never worked with before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to carry out an independent research project over a semester. ",
            "\u00a0I gained biology research skills in the tumor virus lab I was working in throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I am in the process of learning a lot of research techniques, as well as how to manage disappointment when results are unexpected or non-existent. My PI is a good teacher ",
            "\u00a0I am still learning a considerable number of research techniques, while at the same time discovering how frustrating science can be. Check your expiration dates! ",
            "\u00a0Working in the lab allowed me to develop a lot of practical skills in mouse handling and data evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course I was able to take the theoretical knowledge that we have studied in class and apply it in my own research. It was interesting to see these actual skills / lab techniques in practice and gather my own data from them. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy taking MCDB 485 as my senior research class. My PI and grad student have taught me several different protocols, such as DNA sequencing, DNA extraction/prep, mutagenesis, and many others. The questions I am exploring have led to more questions, and I am excited to dive in and keep experimenting to (hopefully) find the answers I am looking for. ",
            "\u00a0How to perform experiments,apply biology concepts and write grant proposal style reports. ",
            "\u00a0I gained hands on experience with a number of very biologically relevant laboratory techniques including immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization. I gained extensive knowledge in very specific cell pathology. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think it is fantastic how hands off this course is and only requires small submissions at the beginning of the year- it truly is the student's work and passion that will make their research experience enjoyable and productive. ",
            "\u00a0As a research course, the strengths and weaknesses really depend on the laboratory that you're working in, so I don't feel like I can speak on behalf of MCDB 485 as a whole. That being said, I really like my PI and the lab that I am working in, and I feel like the experience has been incredibly beneficial. The biggest strength is definitely that I am getting hands-on experience doing procedures that I'll likely need to know how to perform for the rest of my career. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be nice if emails could be sent out, giving us more clear instructions about the assignments and what the class entails. I felt somewhat in the dark sometimes, since we didn't receive much communication. ",
            "\u00a0Can't really comment on any strengths or weaknesses given that it doesn't really feel like a course. I think it's a good way to get people exposed to research in a formalized/structured way if they haven't before. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of the senior research requirements are light and flexible enough to allow appropriate pacing for different research projects, but also well-structured to guide students of different preparatory levels to engage in meaningful research.\r\n\r\nI would love to see more interactions between students, which could range from regular \"get-together\"s to share research insights to leveraging the online forum in Canvas to let students help each other out on troubleshooting their research. The undergraduate community and culture is a powerful and valuable resource that don't exist much later in the scientific career, and would be a shame to not have been explored. It would also help bond together the gigantic community of MCDB students. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the format. The proposal and research proposal force you to stay on top of understanding your research, but also aren't too much work and don't detract from lab time. I think this is a great way to do your MCDB thesis! ",
            "\u00a0I honesty wish we worked closer with members of the MCDB department who were not just our Lab PIs and had assignments where we had to report on our finding to them as well as our PIs. ",
            "\u00a0The course instructors could have sent out more reminders throughout the semester about the deadlines for the proposals and final paper. I checked Canvas and noted these deadlines, but many students found that these came up very unexpectedly. ",
            "\u00a0My lab (and its members) are great. I wish we had more interaction with other people enrolled in the class, though (informally). ",
            "\u00a0There could have been more communication between the admin of the course and the students engaging in independent research. There could have been more guidance on the structure of the lab reports their due dates during the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on your PI. The organization from a course level is minimal through the first semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course's organization is pretty minimal in the first semester. Ten hours a week doesn't allow much science to be done, but of course I want to take other classes, too. It teaches research procedure as long as results aren't what matter. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that you can plan it around your schedule, the weakness of the course is that its hard to fit in 10 hours a week in large chunks and sometimes lab experiments involve large chunks. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the diversity of research projects available to all of the students. Many of the students enrolled in the course also share other electives, or have become friends simply as a result of studying within the same major, as a result conversation surrounding each individual students independent research arises. These conversations not only help students increase their familiarity with the different labs and types of research being conducted on campus but also allows students to learn from one another about areas in biology that their peers are interested in. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fairly flexible. You spend at least 10 hours in lab every week, and complete a 5+ page proposal at the end of the fall semester. It has no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0More guidance from the main organizing professors on the report and deadline reminders would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0There was little communication between instructors and students regarding deadlines. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0You're taking this because you have to - find a lab you enjoy working in and go from there. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it, but it's great! Just be sure that you are interested in your research and your PI and grad students are willing to help you and guide you! The environment in the lab is very important. ",
            "\u00a0You have to do a thesis if you're a MCDB major, so I guess I'll comment a bit about distinction between this course and the intensive course. I was going to do intensive up until the last minute and switched to the one credit course, because I felt that it wasn't worth it to give up 2 Yale classes. Honestly, there's not going to be much of a difference in your resume or prestige or whatever down the road, so just choose between taking 2 other courses v. research. ",
            "\u00a0This is the senior requirement so there isn't much to be said, though I'd say that you gain as much as you put into this \"class\", since it is research after all; and it is a truly invaluable experience if you take the time to think about the research you are doing. You not only learn lab skills and science-writing skills but also how to interact meaningfully with other scientists-- and you'd often be more surprised than not. Great experience overall. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the MCDB senior thesis didn't have to be related to in-lab research or that it would be open to clinical research. I know a lot of students in the major are only doing in lab research for the major and most of us wouldn't do it otherwise, nor do we like it. There are other ways to learn beyond doing work in a a wet lab. ",
            "\u00a0I mean you pretty much have to. I spent a ton of time in my lab and worked really hard and felt myself improve so much as a scientist, so I think it's a great time. ",
            "\u00a0It it what it is, so might as well suck it up and deal with it. Try to find a PI and grad student/post-doc you like at a personal level. The actual topic probably matters less. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you are very interested in your project. ",
            "\u00a0Recommend potentially doing the BS intensive if you have already been working in a lab--devoted way more than 10 hours per week ",
            "\u00a0If you're a senior MCDB major not doing the intensive you have to take it. I'd suggest picking a lab you really get along with, because that will make doing research a lot easier. ",
            "\u00a0This course is for MCDB seniors pursuing the first semester of year long thesis research in a lab (for a BS). ",
            "\u00a0Take it! You have to! Just go find a good PI. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Find a good PI. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah if you have a good mentor this has the potential to be a very positive experience. ",
            "\u00a0It is required for the major, so I would hope you take the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course to take if you know you won't be spending 20 hours in lab, or if you wish to do the presentations in the spring, rather than in the fall. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is required for MCDB majors. ",
            "\u00a0This is the senior thesis so you probably have to do it. It is a pretty straightforward research program with some requirements that allow you to summarize and report your research. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Bio 485 to any MCDB seniors who enjoy hands on biology and are interested in developing a close relationship with a knowledgable adviser. "
