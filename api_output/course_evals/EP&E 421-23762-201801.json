            "\u00a0I acquired a tandem of ethical and legal expertise. Challenged to consider where Ethics and the Law may conflict I learned to analyze legal cases critically as well as discuss their ethical relevance. But wait, there is more: I learned to evaluate the legal system as such, to consider its shortcomings, to design solutions. I was challenged; I grew. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about all the bias that effect the criminal justice system, and the role that ethics plays in addressing these biases. It was incredibly valuable to learn about the criminal justice system from someone who has bene involved with it from many different angles, and who has a very in-depth knowledge of how the system works. In addition to learning about biases and discussing potential reforms, I learned a lot about the intricacies of the criminal justice system itself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the court system works and the various injustices that occur thanks to previous decisions or loopholes. This course made me think critically about how there might be ways we can work in the future to ensure justice in the world. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned a lot about how to read case law. I also learned about legal professions, biases in the criminal justice system, the unfortunate potential for wrongful convictions, and many areas where reform seems very necessary. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of nuances of the law, and how to ethically navigate the challenges of being a legal practitioner. "

            "\u00a0This course has a great syllabus and lively discussions in section. You learn a lot about landmark cases that illustrate broad sweeps in the field, many of which Professor Goodrow has witnessed. I also appreciated the analytical articles included from miscellaneous law review journals and the in-class simulation Professor Goodrow arranged. In terms of weaknesses, discussion might have been more thorough if the course was smaller. In addition, sometimes conversation got a little distracted when students asked tangential questions. The syllabus should also include any small weekly assignments ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a close knit group with a passionate instructor who shared lots of personal insights and experiences. \r\nWeaknesses: discussion could be unfocussed and got slightly repetitive over the course of the semester. More legal and theoretical depth would have been nice. The assessments were not always well thought out ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Read about interesting trials.\r\nWeaknesses: Shallow discussion and not constructive. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were always a lot of fun. Lively and intelligent debate was a constant. The topics were always interesting and the readings reasonably well curated. I would encourage Judge Goodrow to try to cut down on the length of readings sometimes, though. Often reading an entire document felt unnecessary, and I could have gotten what I needed from an abridged version. Importantly, though, the exams felt detached from the class. For both the midterm and final, I felt as though the questions asked had little to do with what we had learned or discussed in class. I completely them mostly by googling and learning new information that allowed me to answer the questions. I would encourage Judge Goodrow to reconsider the questions she asks on the assessments, and tie them more closely to what we are learning. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to have more concrete sources for the ethics component of the course. All the readings spoke to the legal issues, none really referenced any ethical quandaries. ",
            "\u00a0The courses strength was that it was taught by a practicing judge who taught us not only about the law in theory but in practice too.\r\nIn addition to law, the course was supposed to be about ethics too. I think in order for that part of the course to be substantive, we would need a more rigorous ethical framework and readings in legal ethics specifically to ground our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course. I loved the sincerity in conversations about the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = discussion style, focus on application of the material and class engagement ",
            "\u00a0Ethics and the Law had only strengths. Judge Goodrow was knowledgeable, caring and hilarious. Her expertise in and experience with the law was evident in every word she spoke; her humor made every minute of the class a delight. She challenged her students to critically evaluate their preconceived ideas about ethics and the law. She encouraged them to live through legal realities in simulations. Excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is definitely Judge Goodrow - she is incredibly knowledgeable and it is valuable to hear about her personal experience. She clearly cares about the subject and wants to pass along her insight to her students. I gained so much more from hearing about her experience and hearing her relate the class readings to her daily lives than I would have from a regular professor. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class comes from it's structure, there's too much reading to actually be able to discuss in class, especially because each seminar resulted in some sort of tangent related to Professor Goodrow's personal experience (which I preferred to the readings anyways). I valued the class more as an opportunity to hear from and learn from a Judge, rather than an opportunity to improve my academic skill. This could be improved by having more regular assignments (reading responses, for example), or perhaps by having the seminar discussions be a bit more structured. I think it would be helpful to have more structured assignments regarding the basics of the criminal justice system - I often felt a slightly lost during the readings and the discussions because I didn't have a good understanding of the criminal justice process, or of the language being used in the reading. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the set-up. A small seminar is really fun and engaging. Everyone had the chance to speak in class. The material is super interesting. I just wish we didnt have a lot of little assignments but just the midterm and final and class participation. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the relevant and interesting topics, which prompted significant intellectual student debate. A weakness was that the debates didn't always focus on the readings--however, this could also be seen as a strength, because I think that I learned a lot more this way, and the professor was very knowledgeable on many topics. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was absolutely excellent and it was a very fun course. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yesdefinitely! Professor Goodrow shines as an educator and is fair, inspiring, and honest about the issues faced. She also arranged open office hours over lunch with students on her own time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it for the chance to learn from a judge. I liked that she used cases from CT; great to engage with the legal system in teh state ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you can get in! The subject matter, while itself endlessly interesting, is made that much better by an amazing Karen Goodrow. Her experiences as a public defender and judge are the best parts of this class. She is able to offer context to all of the cases you'll read which keeps what could be a boring case law class extremely engaging. In terms of work, there's a midterm exam (about 6 pages) and a final exam (about 12 pages) and a few brief writing assignments in the beginning of the semester. I actually ENJOYED doing the work for this class. Take this course if you appreciate a professor who is more human than robot, if you're passionate about criminal justice reform, or if you'd like to spend one weekday evening doing hypos. You'll also become very close with your classmates because Karen is such an expert at creating a welcoming class environment. ",
            "\u00a0No, it's really not what I expected. I expected a more academically analytical approach to law and ethics, like analysing how the First Amendment is applied in controversial cases (which we did in like the first two weeks of the course), but a lot of this course just felt like a survey of incompetence in law. That may be an interesting topic too, but we didn't constructively analyse these issues - it was more like \"wow, how can a sleeping lawyer get away with that\" or \"how can this committee be so racist\" without (a) actual analysis and (b) methods of reform. This class reads like a series of fun facts and banal essay questions. Seriously, don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend the class. It was a great deal of fun, I learned a lot, and Judge Goodrow was fun, funny, and always a joy to be taught by. The topics are interesting and the debates they bring forth are really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. Definitely take it if youre interested in the law. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to learn about the law in practice, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. YOU have to take this class. Probably the best class at Yale and I'm a senior so thats saying something. Judge Goodrow is an amazing mentor. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing class, definitely take it if the class group/dynamic seems like it would work for you. If the class dynamic is off it is not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If you get in, you would be a fool not to take it. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale--one that I looked for to attending every day when I wasn't. You will learn a lot about the ethics of our legal system while having a truly good time. ",
            "\u00a0For someone who finds criminal justice, and specifically the death penalty, interesting, this would be a great class. For someone looking for an intellectual challenge or an opportunity to gain specific skills, this would not be the right class. The class feels more like weekly guest lecture than a Yale seminar, which I didn't mind, but might be frustrating for some people. I definitely valued the class, as I feel like I have an entirely new perception of the criminal justice system and the death penalty, and it confirmed my inclination that I want to go to law school. However, it was definitely not a class that was particularly stimulating or challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this to another student. The instructor makes the class super fun and you learn a lot of practical information. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially one considering a career in law, as a judge, or any sort of involvement with criminal justice. I thought that the course was a great sort of \"law school lite.\" Even if you're not considering law school (I'm not), this is a great class for people who are interested in debates and discussions about important and relevant issues. It's also a great way to expose yourself to reading case law. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a very fun and engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to get your fill of ethics without having to read dead old white men's musings as well as look at real, local cases with a Connecticut Judge, what are you waiting for? Prof. Goodrow takes the time out of her busy schedule to educate young legal minds. She is kind, hilarious, and genuinely wants to get to know you as a person and not just a student. You will learn all about what is is like to be in a real court room from all perspectives. She also likes to bring in current events and recent student happenings in as legal questions for the class. Most of the cases are state cases (with federal brought in for precedent) which means you need to actually do the reading and can't just Oyez everything, but it's very rewarding. For work, you will define some terms and then write long answers for the midterm and the final on the material with funny hypotheticals. Not everyone in the class are future law school gunners but are people who are generally interested in the decisions being made around them. This was one of my favorite law-based classes at Yale. "
