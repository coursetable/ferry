            "\u00a0I think better course logistics regarding grading would help ease the pressure on the professors to try and trick people to avoid giving out too many A's. It's MCDB 202 not MCDB 300+, the material is objectively not difficult and overlaps with the intro bio sequence as well as other 200-level courses.. there has to be a better format for the course (a final-style midterm in lieu of quizzes or with a reduction in # of quizzes perhaps?) ",
            "\u00a0The professors were all over the place. Following lecture was like going through a haunted house blindfolded. There was no discussion of expectations or direction of the course, and it could not have been less helpful for student learning and development. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good class, the information was presented well in lecture and the quizzes are a really good way to keep up with the information without being overwhelmed. One way to improve is to perhaps in the special Tuesday make an effort to make sure everyone is involved in the discussion or lower the participation percentage because it is very high for only a small amount of time to talk. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a huge strength was the special tuesday format - I really liked breaking into smaller, seminar-like sections. I also think that bi-weekly quizzes are a much better way to absorb the material than just one or two high-pressure midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Special Tuesdays are a major strength of the course since section is built into the class schedule. The multiple choice quizzes are challenging but do a mostly good job at reflecting the lecture content. Downsides include the final, which is nothing like the quizzes in terms of format, and participation counting for 25% of the grade when it's so subjective and depends on you understanding scientific literature, which is very difficult for some. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Biweekly (every other week) quizzes which tested 3 lectures' worth of material kept me up to date; Dellaporta and Gendron are two of the best and most fun and engaging professors I've had at Yale; the topic is SUPER interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Along with the biweekly quizzes comes a biweekly paper on genetics, which is discussed in section; depending on your TA, you'll either totally understand the paper or you won't ",
            "\u00a0Strong adherence to the syllabus was absent for the first half of the course. Some topics listed on the syllabus was not covered, leaving some confusion about how to prepare for quizzes and the final. However, the second half was great and very well organized.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dellaporta is great but Professor Gendron was exceptional. Professor Gendron's enthusiasm and engagement with the class always made me excited to come to lecture! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. Going in, I was intimidated because it was my first upper level MCDB class, but the clear, informative way both Professors Dellaporta and Gendron taught made me feel confident and comfortable with the material. In the first half of the course, one thing that could be improved is the way Professor Dellaporta breaks up his lectures. He was prone to giving out huge packets of slides knowing that there was no way we could cover all of them in one class. But when we inevitably didn't, we rarely picked up where we left off--instead, we usually just started the next lecture, which made it confusing to remember where we left off/what material we were responsible for. In the second half of the course, I wish there hadn't been so much rote memorization, especially in the mutations and repair unit. I don't know if it was is a function of the material itself or of Professor Gendron's style of teaching, but regardless, I wish there were a little more learning and a little less memorization. Special Tuesdays were another major player in my assessment of the course. I loved and appreciated the break from the lecture style, and going through relevant, often recently published papers in a small group setting was a great way to learn. The quizzes that accompanied the Special Tuesdays, however, were a mixed bag. Sometimes they were totally fair, but sometimes the questions were intentionally ambiguous in their wording or obscure in the details they picked up on, which wasn't great for something worth such a large percentage of the grade. The quizzes did, however, keep me very on top of my work in the class, which made studying for the final easier. On the whole, this course was a really great experience and made me excited to be an MCDB major.\r\n\r\nOne additional note: Genetics is inherently a very heteronormative subject matter. Everything comes down to the egg and the sperm, the genes you inherit from your mother and from your father... but not in all cases. Even if it is difficult to teach these genetic principles without making some assumptions, I wish the fact that inheritance isn't always perfectly XX/XY were at least addressed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the final was unfair and weird, and not a proper reflection of our grasp of genetics. Overall, though, I absolutely loved the course. The lectures were very interesting, and the organization was wonderful.\r\n\r\nI do wish we received feedback about how we were doing in discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the team-taught nature of this class was a great strength and allowed the professors to shine in the areas that they knew better. I think the greatest weakness of this class was that there were many typos in the quizzes and final, which made it harder to understand/take/some of the quiz questions had to be thrown out. I thought the quiz format was good because it made studying for the final a lot easier (we'd been quizzed on all of it before). ",
            "\u00a0As for strengths, the course cover the foundations of genetics comprehensively. The 6-quiz scheme is also very helpful and helps students learn without unnecessary overpressure. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, some of the slides were very, very brief and a lot of material was covered in some individual lectures. That especially applies to the first part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the structure of the course - biweekly quizzes every other Tuesday and a discussion about a paper. It kept me on top of the material but wasn't too stressful or overwhelming. Not too much I think needs improving. My only suggestion would be that in addition to the optional book problem sets which are helpful, it would be great if the professors would write one or two questions of their own about the topics they stress as very important as practice for the final (i.e chi squared analyses, etc). Also it would be great if we could get the quizzes back sooner. ",
            "\u00a0-strengths: module format, cool papers, quizzes to check in on material\r\n\r\n-weaknesses: final exam questions based solely on memorization of unimportant names, cheap in comparison to what we learned, and how things work/create mutagens. GWAS paper ",
            "\u00a0A good lecturer in Dellaporta and a fantastic lecturer in Gendron. 7 biweekly quizzes, drop your lowest to make up 50% of your grade. 25% discussion section and 25% final exam. Studying for quizzes is intense, but it's all multiple choice and people usually do well overall. Not sure about the curve. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes were sometimes unusually difficult and varied greatly in the amount of detail that we were required to know. We never got our quizzes back so it was difficult to know what we didn't know. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: comprehensive, exams were fair, learned a lot of material, was very well organized in the second half with Gendron. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel like the course was well organized when Dellaporta taught it. I never knew what to study and it always seemed like an amalgam of material. That being said, he explained the concepts well and I liked him as a lecturer, I just wish that he were more organized. ",
            "\u00a0Dellaporta needs to follow the textbook more. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught in two parts by Prof. Dellaporta followed by Prof. Gendron. Each of the topics covered by Dellaporta is very important and exactly what you would expect from a course in genetics. Gendron's lectures are very good as well (mutations as the source of all genetic diversity and developmental biology from the genetic code). Assessments are through what are called \"Special Tuesdays\" that replace lecture and are held in discussion sections during the class time, comprising a 30 minute quiz followed by a reading of a paper selected by the instructor. I think most students would agree that this format is excellent for keeping up with the material. Importantly however, it should not escape anyone taking the course that 50% of your final course grade is made up from these quizzes and since there are only 6 of them with 10 questions each with the lowest dropped (plus a shorter quiz on the last lecture), the math works out to about 1 point of your final grade per quiz question. The questions on the quizzes are all multiple choice and created so that the mean is expected to be around 7/10. Just something to keep in mind when preparing for the quizzes, which may suit you very well or not. ",
            "\u00a0The paper and discussion sections were very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I like how the lecture slides were printed out for us at every class. Really great to have a physical copy of the material as well as my notes on the same document. Felt like the material that was covered in class was pretty simple but the questions on the quizzes and exam were definitely much higher level, without much help in between. Yes, the psets were helpful but a lot of that was left to the TFs to unpack/review. Felt like there should be more covered in lecture if that's the main way that we will be evaluated. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the Special Tuesday format of this course! I really felt that it facilitated student learning in a novel way, and found myself more engaged in the course than I might have been otherwise as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The biweekly quizzes were very challenging but the content was extremely interesting. Prof Dellaporta also didnt have time to finish his lectures and I wish he had. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biweekly quizzes are good because they force you to really dive into the topics in each unit and really focus on them. However, I think the class did very little preparation for the final. The quizzes were multiple choice while the final was written answer. Along that note, there were no problem set (they were assigned form the book but never actually graded) so it was very hard to prepare for the types of questions we actually saw on the final. The consequence of this was that the quizzes made up most of, and in my opinion, too much of the grade in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include easy to understand lectures. An area of improvement would be in the discussion sections as it would have been better if students were able to collaborate with each other in it as opposed to simple ask and answer dialogue with the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: quizzes every other week to keep you on your toes. Relevant scientific papers to discuss during discussion section (which replaces a class period). TAs are super helpful, and professors usually respond to emails within 24 hours. Fun class! You may or may not have the chance to play with Legos.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes are Multiple Choice (not a weakness) but the final is word problems, so the way we tested in the class the entire semester was completely different for the final. There are \"optional\" word problems for problem sets throughout the course, but these are only really relevant for the final exam. It's weird to have this discord between one form of testing and another. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the course where we have biweekly quizzes are a good way to keep students caught up with the material. I did not enjoy discussion sections over science papers because as a participation grade students were only engaged in class because they were forced to. These lacked genuine participation and were often dull. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course covered a good amount of material, and I liked that we were given the chance to read interesting papers that allowed us to see how the course material was applied in research. I sometimes felt that we got hung up on certain parts of lectures, which slowed our progression through the material, so if I had to change an aspect of the course, I would have liked to see us move through the lectures at a more appropriate pace. ",
            "\u00a0Quizzes and discussion section format was great - forced you to keep up with the material (in a good way) so you weren't cramming like crazy for the final. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if the grades were calculated correctly ",
            "\u00a0The course format (quizzes on content blocks in section every 2 weeks, with primary research articles also discussed during section) was strong. One weakness was that the final exam consisted of quantitative questions, which were not heavily covered/practiced throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Good class. Both professors were good lecturers, the papers were interesting and helped clarify the topics that were covered, and the discussion sections were well run. I wish Prof. Dellaporta had been somewhat less ambitious about the topics he intended to cover in each class period, since he often ran out of time. Otherwise, the class was well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized to facilitate learning, yet some of the lecture slides could have been more descriptive so that students could review material outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the content and the professors, not sure what could've been improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The special tuesdays where we took quizzes and then followed up with a scientific paper discussion was a great way to review the material. Additionally, the slides were decently straightforward and it was easy enough to follow up with material from the textbook.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the biweekly papers strayed from the content, making them difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Mandatory problem sets would have benefitted everyone. The quizzes could have been more similar to the final. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the multiple choice quizzes did not quite prepare me for the written final, although the final itself I thought to be fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - instructor and TFs very helpful and willing to clarify information. Review sessions clearly presented. Slides well organized especially for the lectures taught by Dr. Gendron. Dr. Dellaporta was always approachable and cared about students being engaged and interested. Special Tuesdays format very helpful, preferable to having separate sections. Reading manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/improvements - need to review quizzes during lectures following Special Tuesdays. I can understand concerns with returning the quizzes but I think time should be made to go over the answers and take a few questions for about 15 min. This was done once but I believe it should have happened after each quiz. "

            "\u00a0Take it but be aware that like other intermediate MCDB courses, there are very active attempts to widen the grade distribution in the class.

            "\u00a0Yes I would. All things considered, its not too bad and better than some of the other MCDB electives. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are an MCDB major, or need to take genetics as a requirement for grad/med school. This class is a lot of work, and a lot of questions on tests are worded strangely so pay attention and really think about what the question is asking. This course is better than most 200+ MCDB courses offered, so I recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course ",
            "\u00a0I guess I'd recommend the class to another student. The change from multiple choice questions for the quizzes to short response for the final can be a bit jarring, but the course is interesting and the professors were pretty nice. The papers for discussion section were pretty dry, however. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this course if you're interested in learning more about key topics in genetics, especially if you intend on pursuing a career in biology or medicine. The course was a relatively relaxed course compared to other MCDB electives I've taken, and the quizzes are pretty low-stress if you have a good understanding of the material. I wouldn't take this course if you've already taken a good deal of MCDB electives or classes that feature a lot of genetics material, as you might not learn many new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - tough but super interesting and fun if you (1) enjoy genetics and (2) put the work in. ",
            "\u00a0This course isn't life-changing, but if you are interested in the principles of genetics and how they can be applied to problems in the world (such as disease and the food supply), you will enjoy it and deepen your understanding of science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The topics are interesting and are presented in a way that's at least somewhat challenging for someone who has an intermediate knowledge of biology but that isn't unmanageable. The class isn't the most well organized class in Yale College, but overall has a good quality of teaching. The discussion papers are consistently engaging, the discussion sections are very well run, and the subject matter itself is often enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is an interesting course and definitely worth the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a great intro genetics course that opens your mind to analyzing things you see all the time (diseases, differences in traits, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Both of the professors are passionate about the course material and the TAs are always willing to help. Even though I already had an interest in genetics before this course, I think the class provides a great background for any natural science major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely wonderful course. Dellaporta and Gendron are both great professors who care about their students very much. The workload isn't too bad (a quiz every other week and a final). I learned a lot about genetics and I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely worth it for any MCDB major! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Genetics to any science-minded students with a keen interest in topics in genetics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a wonderful and very thorough introduction to genetics! I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a comprehensive introduction to topics in genetics and will give you important problem-solving skills for work in biology/biomedical research. "
