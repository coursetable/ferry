            "\u00a0Cody was a fabulous Teaching Fellow. She encouraged structured discussion by giving us different discussion activities each week in section. She encouraged us to think for ourselves while still engaging critically with our texts. She prepared us extremely well for all assignments. ",

            "\u00a0Nazanin did a wonderful job tying together some very dense readings, and I looked forward to attending her discussion section each week.  I am thankful to know her; her teaching skills are creative with a healthy mix of individual thought, small group work, and large group discussion.  She also took the time to look up additional media relevant to our readings. ",
            "\u00a0Good effort at encouraging dialogue during sections.  Very dedicated to helping class with assignments, etc.  This complaint is for sections in general.  I wish there was more lecture and less conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Nazanin was an AMAZING TF!! I loved her - she led great section discussions and really guided our understanding of the material. Her support with preparation for papers and tests was also top notch - I felt very comfortable bringing my questions and issues to her. I think she's the best TF I've had throughout my time at Yale - and that's saying a lot! ",

            "\u00a0I cannot praise Cody enough - she was easily one of the best TFs I have had. Not only was she consistently prepared for and engaged in section, she really went above and beyond the call of duty. Each week she brought new ways of going about discussion (my favorite was musical chairs - I liked getting to talk with people all around the room one-on-one). She was also impressively ready to handle lulls in conversation by pointing us to relevant passages and asking new questions. I also remember how she went out of her way to put together a book review guide for us after our section was uncertain about how best to write one. ",
            "\u00a0Nazanin was extremely helpful. She provided helpful feedback on papers and tests. She conducted sections in a productive manner that make it easy to engage and learn. "
