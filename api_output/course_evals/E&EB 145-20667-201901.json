            "\u00a0Wonderful appreciation for the world in and around plants. Lovely class! ",

            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of plant biology as well as how plants have shaped civilization throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned specific and general knowledge regarding plants, and then also such a major component on the interaction between plants and humans and why each are so important to the success of the other. Through a variety of field trips I learned about our environment, physical interaction of plants and humans, and what we can do to protect our world going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about plant biology, the history of plant and human interactions, and current environmental problems we all face. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about plants and their history and human use! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about early agriculture and the biology of plants. I gained valuable information about climate change which is important to know and to spread. ",
            "\u00a0I learned just how strong of an impact plants have on people and general human culture. I learned how human desires for control have led to negative effects on our environment and the natural growing process for plants. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a comprehensive overview of the biology of plants and their significance to human civilization. The perspective is valuable to students without an intensive scientific background ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about plants and humans relationship with plants over time. The beginning of the course had quite a bit of overlap with material one might have learned in high school biology, but this is mostly to bring everyone up to par in terms of foundational plant biology information. After that first third, the information becomes less familiar, ranging from the evolution of flowers to potatoes, tulips, sustainability and more! ",
            "\u00a0Small things about plants that have been monumental in human history ",
            "\u00a0A very general set about everything plant and people ",
            "\u00a0i learned a lot about how to look at the world and the way i interact with it. how am i harming the environment and shaping it? how is the environment shaping what i do? understanding that reciprocity and agency on both ends was really interesting ",
            "\u00a0An accesible introduction and/or review of plant bio, a much deeper understanding of the science behind many of the cooking mechanisms we take for granted, and a greater knowledge of the politics surrounding global warming, monoculture farming, and future threats to agriculture/earth.

            "\u00a0Good introductory material and it is easily understanding but the grading is extremely arbitrary even on what seem like objective exams ",
            "\u00a0Amazing field trips for many classes. ",
            "\u00a0I found it very strong overall, though the lectures tended to overrun the allotted time, which is really my only complaint ",
            "\u00a0The course was, overall, good, but there is absolutely no need for discussion section. It wasnt a very efficient use of time. I also think it could be a twice a week lecture for an hour and 20 minutes rather than 3 days a week. Field trips were great! ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging throughout and held major significance outside of the classroom. There were few weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and covers a lot of ground. The frequent field trips were engaging and informative. I can't think of anything to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class. It's lovingly taught and well put together. Professor Puth is a great lecturer, and the field trips really make it a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the field trips. They were frequent compared to other classes I've taken, and they were a wonderful addition. It really helped me understand the content more. ",
            "\u00a0The spacing of the questions on exams could be improved. Sometimes there was less space to write responses than was ideal. ",
            "\u00a0The course has very engaging field trips and Professor Puth is an excellent lecturer. Be attentive when studying for tests though. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the course itself and the way the material was set up; however, I strongly feel like my engagement wouldve been significantly stronger if the lecture had been 1 hour 15 minutes (because Professor Puth never seemed to get through all the material she wanted to cover in that lecture), and with no section (because as a small lecture there was already opportunity for discussion and questions and I honestly think section was a waste of time) ",
            "\u00a0weaknesses - too broad, should be more focused on certain aspects, sometimes felt all over the place; grading on exams was unclear and unnecessarily strict\r\nstrengths - hands-on activities, great teacher and TFs ",
            "\u00a0strengths: interdisciplinary, lots of TA and professor interaction, cool field trips, research papers/projects that have you get to shape\r\n\r\nweaknesses: marketed for non-stem majors but really hard for non-stem majors in my opinion, each test has far too much content, unclear tests ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredibly accesible class for non-science majors that challenges you to think about your world and your relationship to plants in ways you are always aware of but not always thinking about.\r\nThe tests are often hyper specific and people do not do well on average. Nevertheless, this class is amazing. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was fun and educational. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if a student has an interest in plants/ecology/biology but doesnt want to take an intro science, this is a great option. ",
            "\u00a0If you are someone who isn't interested in science like me, this class is the absolute best to take. It made science so much more appealing because of the human aspect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a very accessible SC to non-STEM people. Professor Puth has been honing this class for years, so it's well organized and thought-out. There are usually two lectures a week and one field trip, plus a mandatory section. There are only a couple of light readings every week, but you have to study a lot for the three exams and the final project will take up a significant chunk of time. However, I thought the workload was manageable, and the grading fair, so I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking to fulfill the science credit with an interesting and relevant course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a wonderful science credit. You get to go on fun field trips all over and discover new parts of Yale! It's really interdisciplinary, the final project can be about just about anything you want, and the tests are pretty reasonable. You learn so many fun things about plants to share with your friends! ",

            "\u00a0i would recommend the course to anyone interested in learning about our interaction with the environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class, especially to folks interested in food and agriculture. It makes you think about your surroundings far more critically and literally makes you see the world with new eyes. "
