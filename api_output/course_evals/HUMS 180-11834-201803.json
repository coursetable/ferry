            "\u00a0In this class, we read and discuss Dante's Divine Comedy and Dante's stances on politics, theology, philosophy, (medieval) science, etc. While perhaps Dante Studies is a rather niche field of academia, the class appeals to a wide range of majors and backgrounds because EVERYTHING is packed into it. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course helped me develop an understanding of both middle age thought and middle age literature and all they encompass. The Comedy really encapsulates the time leading up to the renaissance. My critical thinking and analysis also extended to include the historical context of the literature which made the experience feel very complete. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fun course focusing on Dante's Divine Comedy. I learned everything that I know about the comedy from Christiana. The insights into the epic, as well as how to read it were fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough knowledge of the Divine Comedy and its religious, cultural, historical, and scientific context. In the first lecture, Christiana said that the Divine Comedy has everything in it-- and she's right! ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very deep understanding and love for Dante's Divine Comedy! ",
            "\u00a0I developed a love almost to the point of obsession of the Divine Comedy, and a new appreciation for medieval literature and history. I also strengthened my Italian and gained a new perspective on life. ",
            "\u00a0So, so much. I learnt about politics, religion, art, history, and, believe it or not, science! The Comedy is extremely rich and touches on a plethora of different themes, all captivating in their unique ways. I also truly improved in my writing. My TA gave me the clearest and most in depth feedback I have ever received in my time at Yale and I really feel like my analytical capabilities has increased. I also learned how to love a text, in the sense that the I truly feel attached, on a deep level, with the Comedy, unlike any other text I have read. It will remain with me for a lifetime, I am sure of it, and I am incredibly grateful for this. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a shining beacon of light. I walked away with the entire structure of Dante's hell, purgatory, and paradise in my mind and with more love in my heart than I had coming in. "

            "\u00a0Christiana is an amazing professor and is super engaging. She has so much knowledge on the Divine Comedy and is so excited to share it with us. The material, while intimidating at times, is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The class consists of two 75 minute lectures which tend to go overtime (which is not a problem because I hardly ever wanted it to end) and section, which allows for a more intimate discussion than in lecture. Before one of the lectures in a given week, you have to submit a reading response/question on Canvas, which serves as a reading checkpoint. There are also 5 quizzes throughout the semester, spaced out every two weeks, and those also serve as reading/review checkpoints. They're low stress if you do the readings and take notes during lecture. I really can't think of any weaknesses! It's small enough so that the lecture can feel like a seminar, and the readings are extremely reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should not have both an essay and a final. I understand the urge to test students on their close reading of the text, but the final exam is pretty useless in the long term, and takes away from a thoughtful essay. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably the best course I've taken at Yale. Christiana is a fantastic lecturer, and is very available to students for questions, essay advice, etc. Sometimes class can get derailed or run overtime because of questions, but most of the time, I didn't mind at all. I personally didn't find the blog posts very helpful and would have gotten more out of section if we talked more about the issues in each canto that we found interesting instead of spending fifty minutes answering questions that were mostly already answered by lecture. There are also a few cantos we skipped that I would have liked to cover in lecture, but we were pressed for time as it was. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect. It is perfectly paced, the themes truly carry over the entire the semester, and it allows you to truly look in depth at one of the most extraordinary works in the canon. There aren't many assignments other than the readings, so I was able to truly put a lot of time into reading each canto carefully and getting a lot out of the text. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly don't have much bad to say about the course. I loved the lectures as well as the seminars and the subject matter was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very well organised, the professor and assistant were always vigilant to make the material approachable and interesting, sections were thought-provoking, the exams were very fair, and the readings were amazing, really amazing. This course boasts so many wonderful strengths, and I very honestly don't have much I can say in terms of weaknesses. It has been my favorite course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Dante in Translation literally does not have a single weakness. It is without a doubt the best class I have taken during my time at Yale. It's honestly so much more than a class - it is an experience. Because of Christiana's magic, you literally will start talking, thinking, and dreaming about the Divine Comedy night and day, in and out of the classroom. The most fascinating lectures I have ever been in, wonderful discussion sections, and incredibly fun class activities (i.e. dressing up as characters from the Divine Comedy for Halloween, going to the sung compline service at Christ Church, celebrating Dante's birthday with Italian chocolate, going out for a class dinner with Christiana at the end of the semester and having a feast like the one that happens at the end of Paradise). This class made my heart sing and my mind soar and my entire being happy. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to ANY student from any academic background. There were religious studies majors, physics majors, political science majors, and this diverse field of studies meant that there were a ton of different interpretations of Dante's text. Most people have very little exposure to the Divine Comedy, and this is the perfect course to enter Dante's system of the afterlife. The Comedy makes you think just as hard as it makes you feel, and if you shed a few (or a lot of) tears at the end of the journey, you definitely won't be alone. It's not an exaggeration to say that this class and book can change your outlook on life, on philosophy, on theology. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. So far it has been my favorite course at Yale. If you don't believe me, go to the first day of class which was an intro lecture. Everything the professor said in that first class remained true all the way to the end. Take this course if you want to learn almost everything there is to know about the Divine Comedy, and end up loving every part of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so so much about Dante in this class. It was a ton of fun and Christiana really cares about her students . ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great literature course, which is pretty self contained so it's accessible to non-English majors. Christiana is really passionate about Dante so the lectures stay interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. You don't have to be a humanities major or an Italian speaker to enjoy the Divine Comedy. You don't have to be religious to emotionally resonate with Dante Pilgrim's journey or to appreciate the beauty of Dante's poetry. There really is something in the Divine Comedy for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I had no knowledge of Dante whatsoever before taking this course, and reading the Comedy has affected me so profoundly.  Hearing Christiana's incredible lectures will make your day. During the first lecture, she promises that the Divine Comedy contains EVERYTHINGand throughout the semester, she truly proves this. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It presents Dante in a captivating, engaging way so that it kind of pervades your whole life. The focus is not on the professors or the assignments, but on the poem, its depth and beauty. Even if you cannot take the class, I would highly recommend reading the poem. ",
            "\u00a0This has been one of the most amazing experiences of my academic career. The course has deeply changed the way I see the world, influenced my understanding of history and literature, and allowed me to figure myself out a lot. I had goosebumps after every lecture and was genuinely excited to go back to my room to do the assigned readings. The professor and TAs made sure that we understood all the most important aspects of the Comedy, and were always available for us. The course has been the best I have taken at Yale, and I would DEFINITELY recommend taking it! If you are afraid that the Comedy will be hard to read or that the course is like all other \"old\" literature courses, do not worry, it is absolutely not. This course allowed me to grow as a person, and I am sure it will do the same for you. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class for anyone who wants to explore not only the comedy but much of the literature, history, science, etc. of the middle ages ",
            "\u00a0This might sound hyperbolic, but I promise it's not -- Dante in Translation is literally lifechanging. Dante, and Christiana, have altered the way I think and approach the world. I would recommend this course with every single cell in my body. EVERYONE at Yale should take this class, not just because Christiana is the loveliest and most brilliant person imaginable but also because, like she says, LITERALLY EVERYTHING is in the Divine Comedy (art, medicine, astronomy, etc.) so there is truly something for everyone. You will eat, sleep, and breathe Dante, and you will love it all (seriously -- Christiana will make sure of it). Like I said, this class made my heart sing and my mind soar and my entire being happy. Please, please, please take this class. You will not regret it for a second, and it'll probably be the best decision you will make in your four years at Yale. "
