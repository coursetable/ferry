            "\u00a0I gained a more nuanced perspective of the research design process and steps that can proactively be taken to develop and execute research projects. Additionally, I learned about tools and techniques to effectively communicate research findings and theories to a academic audiences. Furthermore, Balazs helped me develop concepts for two survey experiments that I anticipate moving forward on in the Spring 2018 semester and in my dissertation research. ",

Second, it provides students with an opportunity to learn new tools of academic research and the mediums that enable us as researchers to apply those tools. Furthermore, as a first semester PhD, I found this course to be a great way to learn from the experiences and perspectives of early career scholars (or PhDs in training) in ways that have and will continue to enrich my own research projects. ",
            "\u00a0The 3 hour block is a bit long, continuing to break up lectures with group work would be great. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of any weaknesses. The class was well organized with a tremendous amount of reading material. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength was the instructor's ability to make a relatively dry topic fun and engaging with in-class exercises. The class atmosphere was always friendly and thought provoking, everybody felt comfortable asking questions any time and three hours felt like much less. \r\nI personally would have liked more sessions on qualitative methods but over all, it was a great course!
