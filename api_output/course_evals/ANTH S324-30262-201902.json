Board of Education. It investigated a range of historical, legal, and contemporary issues relevant to both the segregation and desegregation of American cities and their public schools in the twentieth and early twenty-first century.

            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of education and housing policy in this course, the history of these topics in the U.S., and gained insights into ongoing debates in public policy. At the end of the course, I had grown in my ability to read and analyze texts in the social sciences and ethnographic studies. The discussion-based nature of the course allowed me to develop my capacity to formulate opinions based on readings and clearly communicate these. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it gave students a chance to read many relevant readings, share opinions on class (both with classmates, professors, and speakers), and conduct research on topic based on personal interests; but sometimes the time schedule was not always go along with the plan, letting shorter times to discuss some of the readings.

            "\u00a0I liked that the students were responsible for doing the reading and coming prepared to discuss so that the most could be made of time in the classroom. One of the strongest features of the course were the guest speakers who brought unique and compelling perspectives to the classes and deepened my understanding of the material and the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were all the guest speakers that the professor brought in, a few whom I had the privilege to meet for the first time and a few whom I've known from working around New Haven. That was very educational and fun. The professor was very well connected. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be how short the course is. Although I do feel like I've learned a whole semester's worth of material, I still wish I spent 3 more months on it. "

I think it is incumbent on Yale students to understand the city of New Haven and other cities like it around the country while they reside there. It has also developed my critical thinking and communicative abilities and I think the same would be true for others. ",
