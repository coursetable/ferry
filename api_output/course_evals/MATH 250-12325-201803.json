What even is Vector Analysis you may ask? Hell if I know. What does one learn in this class you may ask? Unclear, tbh. Was it entertaining? Totally! Stefan is a wild human being who provides endless entertainment. He is so enthusiastic about math (in general) but seemed to care literally not one bit about structuring a good class. If you're reading this review because you're wondering if you should take 250, I cannot help you. This experience was an anomaly defined entirely by Stefan. ",

My feeling was that this course is supposed to tie together concepts you learn in multivariable calculus and linear algebra and prove a lot of things from Math 120, but I also think that it differed a lot this semester because Stefan was teaching it and that some of the concepts we covered were different from in past terms.

The course was good at giving me a mathematical intuition for all of these. ",

At other times, it felt like there was little structure to the course as it moved through the big topics (convergence and series, differentiation, integration) that made having a coherent understanding of the broad lessons of the class difficult.  Sometimes, I wished things had been approached more rigorously. Sometimes, I was grateful that we didn't waste time on things that the Professor didn't think were actually meaningful and did other things like Newton's Method. I think your impression of the class depends on what you want to get away from it and how you learn. ",

I learned a few things past what was taught in 120: Newton's Method, what integrals and many of the theorems really mean, but not much more functionally (although that is what you should expect from this class). The final exam was also significantly harder than either midterm. ",

As a prerequisite for the analysis classes, I was expecting a more defined area of study, not a complete mix of linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and analysis. To be perfectly honest, this class should not really exist. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: this course covers interesting material that is applicable to many fields, and the lectures were a lot of fun. The psets were difficult but rewarding. Weaknesses: there was a lot of material to cover, and not enough time was given to some of the concepts that were more difficult to understand. Exams were out of a small number of points, and grading and feedback were very inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be an excellent one to sit in on. Stefan is incredibly engaging, and his mastery of math as well as math history makes his lectures fascinating and flexible. This flexibility sometimes comes with a cost. We lingered far too long on certain topics while rushing by others. We had no plan or structure to the lessons on a macro scale, so we didn't have a reference for what was relevant regarding the midterms and finals. The midterms were graded out of six (6) points, and the higher one accounted for 50% of our entire grade, which made them feel incredibly variable and not good representations of our learning. The final was also far harder than was warranted, especially with how non-rigorously we covered certain topics. All in all, the time in the class was great. The time outside was not. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material was interesting, I learned a lot from the problem sets (which were usually a good level of challenging, except for a couple near the beginning that took a little too long...), Stefan's sense of humor and entertaining accounts of math history, very helpful peer tutors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would've appreciated more sample proofs/detailed feedback for the earlier problem sets, to have a better sense of what made a complete proof/what I could improve on. Lectures were sometimes hard to follow; proof steps that were obvious for Stefan were sometimes a bit of a leap for us. I'm also not sure if the midterms were really a good way of evaluating how well we understood the course material. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how excited the professor was about material and what he chose to teach us, but homeworks were often confusing. ",

Also some interesting problems help to show the incredible nature of some of these theorems and discoveries\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Little helpful feedback from graders and professor on how to improve and correct errors made on homework. Inconsistent notation and occasional lack of rigor was an obstruction in learning the material ",
            "\u00a0The course is difficult, but with the proper time put in can be very rewarding. I enjoyed the material learned throughout the course, and found the challenge to be fun but not deprecating. ",
            "\u00a0Stefan is an engaging professor, but at times the course felt like an assorted math class. The final section on integration helped bring a lot of the material together, but for a while I was not clear how we were supposed to put together the things we were learning. Peer tutors were fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets asked interesting and challenging questions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the lectures moved quickly and didn't offer much preparation for the problem sets.\r\n\r\nPeer tutor hours were enormously helpful and quite fun. A teaching assistant would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topics like Newton's method, fixed point theorems, and Monte-Carlo integration were covered.\r\nWeaknesses: Stefan only gave a cursory treatment of the topics that are meant to be the core of this course, such as differentiation, Riemann integration, and Stoke's theorem and its corollaries. ",
            "\u00a0This course was all over the place, to be honest. Some of the concepts were interesting and I can see how they'll come up in later math courses. But I think the main flaws were that it was hard for us to get good feedback on our work and it was difficult to get help with the problem sets when we were having trouble. At the beginning of the semester the graders weren't grading our problem sets properly, so sometimes we thought that we had done problems correctly but it turned out that our proofs were actually wrong. Stefan eventually found a new grader, but it was definitely frustrating at the beginning of the semester to not really have a good idea of whether or not you were approaching problems correctly. Our peer tutors were really great and tried their best to help us, but since we covered some different material from when they took the course sometimes they were just as confused as we were. After the problem sets were due, Stefan didn't like to post \"answers\" because he said there were no single right answers and there could be a hundred correct ways to prove something. While I can see how this may be true, it would have been really helpful to see at least one right answer. The graders posted sample answers taken from students' psets, but the ones from the beginning of the semester weren't always correct and we never really got good clarification about that so we could study for the exam. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated sample solutions from the instructor and a better textbook to accompany the class, since the Hubbard one wasn't really that helpful. I think I also would have had an easier time following along in lecture if Stefan had been able to slow down some, since he went pretty quickly most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0The course has little to no structure so it was difficult to schedule studying outside of the classroom. The textbook for the course is also very bad. ",
            "\u00a0The course was difficult for me, as it was my first introduction to proof-based mathematics. However, even people who took MATH 225 before found this course very difficult. I think part of the reason was that Stefan was not always the most organized during lecture (e.g. having many tangential asides, switching notation including during exams) and sometimes the direction the course was taking was unclear. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good because it gave me a good intuition for the topics we discussed and helped me understand concepts such as the second derivative test in a more rigorous way.  I would have preferred it some of the material (e.g. implicit function theorem, change of variables formula, stokes theorem) had been proved in a more rigorous way. I understand that the detailed proofs of these theorems are not really important; however, this is probably the only time in my life I was going to see them, so I would have liked exposure to the proofs nonetheless. On the whole though, the class was easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been better if we had followed a textbook or given an outline of topics. It was difficult to follow along during lecture as to what topics we were covering, and I didn't feel prepared for our problems sets each week. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinerberger would always insist that he wrote easy tests, but the final was orders of magnitude more difficult and complex than either midterm; other students agreed with me about that. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I really really enjoyed this class, but I think it depends on what kind of a person you are. Professor Steinerberger is a good lecturer in that he's good at illustrating what's really going on with the math as opposed to just relying on definitions and notations. If you like to rely on firm definitions and rigor, this might not be the class for you. If you are thinking of using vector caculus in an applied field, you might learn a lot about relevant techniques (Newton's Method, Numerical Integration, Implicit Function Theorem, Maximization/Minimization problems). If you do take it, be prepared to sink a lot of time into this class. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, no. Stefan is an interesting teacher and good lecturer, but it gets ruined by exams. The grading is so arbitrary, and does not actually reflect your learning in the class. You can easily drop a letter grade for a tiny computational error. The final exam made everyone wonder what the whole point of the class was, it was brutal and the consensus was that everyone felt blind sided and completely unprepared for it. Not even sure what the point of studying for the final was because the only difference was I knew what I was getting wrong, still couldn't do any of it. Good as a learning experience, extremely frustrating as a class. ",

Probably not in a very heavy-workload semester, though the problem sets (and honestly understanding any of the material) took a lot of time and effort. But looking back it felt pretty rewarding to see how much I'd learned in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it just because it's pretty fundamental skills you are learning if you ever want to do something quantitative later in life. It forces you to build a familiarity with calculus and linear algebra. There are also some fun things that the professor brings up from time to time, and he might make you appreciate math more. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to improve their skills in proof based math. However, I would recommend the course to a student who has the time to commit to doing the problem sets and looking over the material from class (you won't understand all of it the first time around). The class is definitely challenging and will require that you spend time and mental energy in understanding the material and doing the psets in doing so. However, if you do commit the time, I think its a great opportunity to become much more confident in your ability to do proof-based math and work through problems that you may not have ever seen or cannot solve at first (or second or multiple) glance.

            "\u00a0Not if Stefan is teaching it. (On the merit of the material itself, it's worth taking.) Stefan is a polarizing figure. His lectures are \"improvisatory\" in that he doesn't really prepare them. For some reason, he recommended a textbook that he then proceeded to make fun of it for the rest of the course. Why not choose a textbook that he actually thinks would be a good teaching tool, instead of defaulting to the book that Casson (previous instructor) used? Midway through the semester, students requested that Stefan provide possible problem solutions to our psets in lieu of trustworthy feedback from the student graders. Stefan replied with the lazy answer that he can't give solutions to a proof-based class. This is simply not true. Of course, he could not give an exhaustive list of possible strings that are valid proofs, but providing a possible solution would have been a vital way to learn when feedback was otherwise inadequate. The real reason that Stefan didn't want to do it was that it takes him time to do so. This is a valid objection, though an ideal teacher would make the time to provide such a valuable resource. Finally, Stefan was rarely helpful and often dismissive in office hours. His gruff response to one of my questions: \"We covered that in class.\" Of course we covered the topic in class, but why would I come to office hours to ask further about it if his explanation in class was sufficient? In summary, teaching is not a priority for Stefan. Sure, he publishes like crazy (he put out almost 8 papers during this semester; search him on arXiv), so it would be hard to call him \"lazy\" without qualificationbut it's too bad that he doesn't focus more of his energy on effective teaching. ",

It was a tricky course that didn't really have good resources to support students and I felt pretty confused about the problem sets a lot of the time. But I also think that it might be a class that varies a lot semester to semester, so I don' know how much of my experience is relevant to the way the course will be next time. ",
            "\u00a0If interested in pure math, definitely take it. But do not take the class just to fulfill a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Most people who took the course needed to - if you don't, it is still an interesting course, but be prepared to set aside more time to review the material and complete the problem sets. Also, don't take this course under Stefan - he had a really bad grading scheme where he makes questions 1 point (so our midterms were out of 6). This resulted in a grading scheme with very low granularity and even a fractional point off would take off many percentage points off your grade. When someone suggested he make the final more granular, he simply added more 1 point questions instead of just assigning more points to a question (like a typical exam). It made for a very high anxiety test environment where the cost of making small mistakes was much higher than the reward for getting something correct. ",

Expect that a lot of the concepts will sounds familiar to things you have already learned, but you'll come out of this course with a better understanding of them. This class is also a good introduction to proofs and mathematical induction, so definitely worth taking before MATH300 ",
