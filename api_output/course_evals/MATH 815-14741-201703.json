The initial lectures (e.g. those on categorical harmonic analysis) are quite easy to follow, so that anyone with basic undergraduate training can understand the ideas. Over time, the course does get much more difficult as it begins to introduce material from more advanced category theory, topology, and algebraic geometry, but there is always a variety of material in each lecture so that you will never be completely lost.
