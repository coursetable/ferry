            "\u00a0I have learned a lot about the principles, theories, and instruments of NMR and other spectroscopies. I also learned how to design and rationalize an experiment, write a proposal, and read a paper properly. ",
            "\u00a0NMR and optical spectroscopy. Proposal writing. ",
            "\u00a0I think I developed a better theoretical understanding of Bio NMR and a good understanding of the basic experiments done. I also think I will be better equipped to read papers on the subject in the future. I also think I developed a better practical understanding of vibrational and fluorescence spectroscopy in biophysics. Just like with NMR, I think I will have a better understanding when reading papers that use these methods in the future. ",

            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course is that it combined the theoretical part with the experiments and really showed how the spectroscopy/technique can be utilized and applied to biological systems.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that this course required a lot of prior knowledge of physical and theoretical chemistry, which I did not have. Therefore, it was very difficult for me to understand the materials. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures and discussion. It would be better if the NMR component is more focused on applications than on theoretical descriptions in the half-semester period. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the focus on the theoretical understanding of NMR, but at the same time it also felt very compressed. I liked the class being split between the two different types of methods, but it didn't feel like a very even split. I liked reading papers on methods following the lectures. I think it would have been helpful if the lectures given on grant writing took place right before I started writing my proposal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - good overview of a variety of methods\r\nWeakness - the NMR part should really be at least a full semester. Just setting up/first explaining all of the formalism takes time. Understanding that + all of the methods used in protein structure determination and dynamics takes even more time. "

            "\u00a0I took this class as an undergrad (senior MB&B major).  The class was definitely a challenge, but I learned a lot of really valuable information about NMR, fluorescence, and vibrational spectroscopy.  If those things interest you, definitely take this class!  Pat and Elsa are both experts in their fields.  I would perhaps recommend Credit/D/F; I took it for a letter grade, and it was fine. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but only if the NMR part is expanded enough to do justice to this rich/complex subject! "
