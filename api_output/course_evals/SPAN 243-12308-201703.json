            "\u00a0I became much more proficient in speaking, reading, writing, and understanding Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0When I was picking my L5 course to complete the language requirement, I chose this one because I didn't want to jump right into Spanish literature. In other words, I thought this was going to be an easy course, since I had studied so much Spanish grammar in the past. However, this course lives up to its name. This is advanced Spanish grammar. You really get the grammar drilled into your head, and I think my writing skills have benefited from this course. I am more conscientious when I write in Spanish, thinking about grammaticality, as I would do in English. This class overlaps with some of what you learn in high school, but you do learn new grammar points. What surprised me was that this class was probably the most work out of all my classes. There is nightly homework, and much of the homework is graded. You learn about all the nuances of Spanish grammar, but I think it was an unreasonable amount of work. If you're a pre-med worrying about the grade, you better be good at Spanish because this is a serious class. You get what you put into it. There are many opportunities to make up your grade, and there is no cumulative final. You do not have to worry about Spanish during reading period or finals week! I wouldn't say I enjoyed this course, but I cannot say that I didn't learn anything. Overall, I feel that my Spanish writing has improved greatly. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it pertains to only grammar, and this allows for students to focus only on bettering their understanding of grammar and different constructions. ",
            "\u00a0It was very effective in improving our grammar but we couldve had some lessons more focused on speaking. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was the small size of the class which allowed for personal attention. One weakness of the class was that it did not put enough emphasis on polished speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of homework and reading every night, which was good for practicing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne weakness in the class is that we watch a couple movies only to talk about them for a day. They aren't really used in class instruction. The movies that we watch in class seem like a waste of time to me since we don't really use them as context to learn more grammar or to talk about them as speaking practice. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student as an introduction to L5 Spanish at Yale. It isn't an extremely interesting class content-wise, but it provides great fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if you want to truly master Spanish grammar. There are a lot of grammar worksheets, so if you don't like those, then you might not like all of the homework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if you want an L5 that isnt fully centered on speaking. Its a good foundation for future courses. The textbook was my life. Its a lot of work but totally worth it. I came in not very prepared but by the end I feel very knowledgeable about the nuances of Spanish grammar. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the work outside class hours, then your effort will pay off big time ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It definitely helps with becoming better at Spanish. However, I would advise the student to be prepared and work harder than they expect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if they need to brush up on Spanish before taking literature courses. I took this course after a year off Spanish and it was manageable. Most students were not at all native speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to improve their Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody who is confident in the Spanish language and wants to improve/solidify their command of Spanish grammar. It is a very useful class if you plan to use Spanish in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to another student. By taking this course, my Spanish improved tremendously and I'd suggest that anybody who wants to improve their Spanish-speaking abilities take this course. "
