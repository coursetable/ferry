While it was informative, especially for those who did not already have a background in public health, the course focused on obvious issues rather than the more critical ones. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the course did not engage students.

It hardly engaged anyone, nor did it make me feel any more equipped to tackle ethical dilemmas. ",

            "\u00a0This course did not have much to offer.  The course consists of 3 lectures with no exams or assessment; there is no reason to take notes or be actively engaged.  Conversations about ethics may be better addressed in smaller groups with discussions rather than long lectures that could be dry at times. ",

This course would have greatly benefited from being broken into discussion sections--smaller sections would have enabled students to have guided discussions about ethical issues in public health. This, articulating and hearing thoughts on the matter, may have been more useful than simply just learning thru a lecture. ",

Mobile polling?) ",

This would be much better served as a first-year requirement that lasts the whole semester, rather than a three-week mini-series. ",

A main weakness was that the main professor seemed highly opinionated, and had trouble entertaining some students' questions and concerns. ",

            "\u00a0I felt this course was an unnecessary additional workload for students.  The material covered can easily be incorporated into other classes so that students shouldn't have to attend an additional 80 minute long seminar during the week when they're already taking 5 classes, a 2 hours/week professional skills seminar, and a department specific seminar (all this not including lab positions, extracurricular activities, and internships).

Because of this it felt like most of my classmates did not want to be there and most people did not pay attention or gain a lot out of the course. As it was 100% lecture based with no evaluation schemes, it was very easy to not do work for the course. The topics were interesting and I enjoyed the supplemental readings, however I believe interaction within the course would have helped me learn a lot more. ",

Maybe half the class could be lecture and half could be small group discussion. ",

These courses need to be taught by great professors if the program expects to move up in rankings. ",

Personally, I think this is a vital aspect of public health, one that is ingrained in the \"public\" nature of the profession. I was expecting more. I was disappointed to hear that previous years had small group discussions and more depth to Their coursework. It seems an oversight on Yale's part that the course structure would be different merely because a faculty member was on sabatical. I would think that would be unacceptable.  I was expecting to be introduced to new concepts pertinent to our profession, but I wasn't at all. I didnt learn anything new.  Now, maybe other students did, but I wasn't expecting the lowest common denominator from this course. I felt it was a short history lecture not a bioethics in public health course. ",

If I could redo this semester, I would have advocated to take a full class rather than this little no-credit thing.
