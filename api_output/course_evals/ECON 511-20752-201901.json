            "\u00a0I do think the well--meant attempt of introducing continuous stochastic processes and stochastic calculus in a single 90 minutes lecture is misplaced. I would either spend more time on the material or cut it altogether. The presententation, in my opininon, was not helpful both to students who lacked knowledge about these topic and to students who had previous exposure to the material. While it is understandable that a rigorous treatment would require at least a one semester long course, handwaving about important conceptual issues and presenting proofs that are clearly wrong is --- in my opinion --- not a good way to teach.
