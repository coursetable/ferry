            "\u00a0I like how to course was very personal, as we could write about almost whatever we wanted, and about topics that meant a lot to us. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-structured. I particularly liked the essay workshops that had the class critique a coursemate's work. Moreover, the seminar format allowed for ample opportunities to pose questions to clarify and enhance my understanding.\r\n\r\nI liked that the course was not at all content-focused, but aimed to foster an appreciation of good writing styles, and in doing so allow us to cultivate our own writing style.\r\n\r\nI certainly enjoyed the selection of readings, from a wide spectrum of writers, all of which added to my understanding of creative non-fiction writing.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I thought there was sometimes too much focus on the meaning of the text, i.e. what the writer was trying to say, rather than how the writer wrote it. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more \"lecture-style\" to talk about strengths of essays. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the level of feedback given to each individual essay that allowed me to pinpoint areas of improvement. The course could be improved by adding comparisons between works we read in class and our own to show how objectively \"good\" writing is differentiated from amateur writing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is workshopping each students writing at least once. The weakness is not getting a lot of feedback for my writing. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It's a great way to improve your writing and hear the thoughts of your classmates. It is also a nice exercise in self-reflection as you write about different places and people in your life. The readings are so good, too. Take with Professor Hartman! She will give you so much individual attention. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class!!! Regardless your major/interests/background, this class will teach you more about writing and yourself than you think. So much fun; you literally spout of your own opinions about things and the readings (collection of FANTASTIC ESSAYS). You leave with better writing and a nice writing sample. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a must-take for any student interested in crafting a personal essay   more effectively ",
