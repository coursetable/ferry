I wish the assignments were more lengthy at the beginning so that even before finals period we could have had most of our 20 pages done. ",

            "\u00a0I would encourage any EVST senior to pursue a thesis. It's a lot of work, but incredibly rewarding - you can really leave your undergrad career as an expert on a specific topic. "
