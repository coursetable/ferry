Also I have gone to multiple office hours where the ULAs and TFs did not know the answer to questions about the content. Hard to receive help when the help does not have the answer. ",
            "\u00a0This class was somewhat organized, though there's definitely room for improvement. For example, most of the class is looking at different hypothesis tests , and they're all similar with very subtle differences. I feel like there could have been more organization done to emphasize the subtle differences between those tests. \r\n\r\nI like that this class introduces students to R, but I'm also coming into this class with a bit of R experience. (I was really here to learn the stats so I can interpret the R outputs that I was getting in my work.) I can definitely imagine this class being difficult for someone with absolutely no R experience. There are office hours but my understanding is students use it mostly to just work out the problem sets. I think it could be helpful to have a time dedicated to learning R. (An example is an F&ES class in R has Friday \"boot camp\" where people come in to just practice working in R.) \r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, I really don't like that this class is not no-tech. I understand it's helpful to have computers for the R practice, but we're not always using R, and it's really distracting for me when other people around me are just in their computer and clearly NOT paying attention to the lecture. It just made it really difficult to concentrate on the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastically organized. Professor Wang did an amazing job of putting up all lecture notes, including code, up on Canvas, as well as sample solutions to homework assignments shortly after we turned them in. Also, she put out practice exams before each midterm and before the final, which made studying targeted and very efficient. Too bad she's going back into industry, but perhaps she'll return in a few years. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor made all of the lectures very engaging and used real-life data sets to show us how what we were learning is applicable; the readings were manageable and highlighted key concepts; the professor provided lots of practice resources for exams and the exams reflected course material well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not as big of an emphasis on Rat times it felt like the statistics side of the course dominated so much that learning how to code in R was an afterthought ",
            "\u00a0A little too quick, but great at integrating and presenting information both on the R side and on the stats side. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it provides an overview of many of the different statistical analyses we use in the everyday world and furthermore introduced us to the R language, which is what many statisticians in the real world use to help them with computations. It was incredibly cool to be able to manipulate original data sets from real world experiments and find relationships between variables through R. The course also provided a useful textbook and series of notes that were incredible learning tools. The use of Piazza as a forum in which peer to peer interactions were encouraged was also a positive feature of the course, in my opinion. I cannot think of any weaknesses in the course and do not think it could be improved. However, I do have to add the caveat that I believe this course was so well-designed because of Professor Wang, who is truly an amazing professor and person. Since she is leaving Yale, I have no idea what the course will look like in future years. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that it introduces R programming at the same time as Statistics as a science. Weaknesses that it is indeed intensive and could facilitate more hands-on work. The problem sets were mostly copying over code from class and changing a couple variables. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was taught really well and I loved the coding aspect. There were lots of office hours and resources available. The worst part was the early morning timing. I will say that the wording on a lot of the tests was extremely confusing and I would get questions wrong simply based on misinterpreting the question. ",

One weakness though, is that the assessments tend to be too easy, and a lot of people do well on them, making the course feel quite competitiveness ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that we learned a lot about of important material. The class is also very applicable to the outside world. The weaknesses are that there are a lot of little nuances in the course material that can be a little confusing. A few times I felt as though the textbook, and what I heard from instructors were contradictory. ",

            "\u00a0S&DS 220 provided a great introduction to how to perform certain statistical calculations and analyses \"by hand\". However, I felt that the computing aspect of the course was a bit weak. Most of the lectures only minimally involved R, which was frustrating because all real statistical analysis is conducted using computers, not scientific calculators and a pencil. We only were presented with very basic statistical functions in R, and the only R-related assignments we did were very simple applications of examples we learned in class; there was very little intellectual challenge in terms of statistical computing. I think that the course would benefit from replacing the parts of lecture where simple examples are done multiple times on paper with more in-depth, complex problems that make use of R to analyze data. ",

There are pdfs/htmls of the class notes and work in R for every class meeting, which is deeply useful for revisiting a topic/buffing a concept. The textbook is also a great selection- I don't think I've encountered such a clear text for a class before. Prof. Wang is also very, very smart and cares deeply about the class. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: R is a powerful language and learning how to do it feels like a useful skill. Susan is also a clear lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: material can sometimes feel repetitive/already covered in high school. Textbook readings (not the most interesting) are required. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: 9 am class\r\n\r\nStrength: great professor ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Wang did a pretty good job laying out a foundation for statistics, but the lectures about R were sometimes hard to follow. I wish the lectures were recorded so I could go back and watch them when doing the problem sets. I also didnt love the fact that piazza posts counted towards our participation grade. This caused piazza to be flooded with questions that werent always necessarily very helpful - sometimes it just seemed like people were posting just to get credit. I think overall the class was still solid, though. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how this course was taught in R. ",
            "\u00a0The usage of R is definitely a strength of this course. So are the psets, that are the perfect length and very useful. \r\n\r\nA weakness is probabaly te weight that is attached to Piazza participation. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Susan was very engaging and her style of teaching (writing on her iPad and explaining the concept) made the lesson feel more personal. Office hours were also very useful. \r\nWeakness: Would have liked to see solutions for the final exam/what I missed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course served as a good introduction to statistics, and I especially like that R was integrated in the class throughout the whole semester. I also thought this class was organized very well, with scheduling, expectations, and grading made very clear. The turnaround time for assignments was very quick, and there was opportunity for feedback with every exam and homework. I also liked the convenience of using Piazza as a discussion forum. ",

In addition, the online notes were very useful, providing concise summaries of key concepts and good amounts of practice problems. My only suggestion is that the assignment deadline be shifted from noon to midnight! ",
            "\u00a0strengths: using R to learn statistics, allowing us to see how to apply these concepts in real life\r\nweaknesses: not really any ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Wang was a strength of the course because she always came very prepared to the class with an exact knowledge of the material she wanted to cover in class. That being said, sometimes she went over the material, especially R code, very fast so that you hardly had to follow her on your own computer. In my opinion, one weakness of the class was the early start. It was struggle for me to wake up for the class/to go to class a couple of times either because of early practices or late nights when I had to study longer for other classes. ",
            "\u00a0The information was taught well at a reasonable pace. The \"cheat sheet\" allowed for the test encouraged understanding the concepts, rather than memorizing the formulas. I wish R were integrated a bit more; the homework assignments and the exams felt disconnected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class over went fine. Instruction was pretty clear, but Susan mentioned she'd be leaving academia soon so that could change. \r\nWeaknesses: The second half of the class focuses A LOT on hypothesis testing, and I think we could've gained exposure to other areas of statistics instead of zooming in on this tool. What we learned in R also felt like a bit of a waste, as it's difficult to test on a paper exam and therefore felt secondary. We didn't go as in depth with R as I feel we could've. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a well organized class with lots of resources. The only tough part was piatza. I think I learn better in person rather than through online forums. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great textbook that makes it easy to learn the material but the class did not focus a lot on R and I don't feel that I have a strong enough foundation for R. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very organized. Everything was up on Canvas and available to students, including notes (PDFs and R-coding files) for reviewing. I liked the data sets we used; thought they were pretty interesting. My favorite was the data frame we \"scraped\" from Wikipedia and used for a problem set! I also enjoyed the problem sets. I thought they were interesting and pretty manageable on the whole. I also really enjoyed having Piazza as a resource.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like we moved a little fast through some of the concepts. Also, the midterms were only out of very few points, so even if you made a small mistake (ex: forgetting a square root), it have a big impact (of percentage points) on the grade, which didn't feel like a very good representation of all that's learned in the course. ",
            "\u00a0One recurring challenge of the course: 9am! Other than this, lectures could sometimes be a little hard-to-follow all the way through. However, these are less a weakness and more something to keep in mind. Annotated class notes and R code, alongside a wide smattering of office hours with multiple TA's and Prof. Wang, alongside a really comprehensible textbook, meant that I always felt plenty of support in learning the material and working through psets. Prof. Wang clearly cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0The course assigns a manageable amount of work and expectations are made relatively clear.  However, I feel the course topics could have been chronologically ordered better.  Additionally, since R was not on the exams, students had relatively little incentive to build R proficiency. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were that many interesting and relevant datasets were used and the instructor was always helpful. Weaknesses of the course are that it was heavily textbook focused and the lectures were a little fast-paced. "

So if you are in a similar boat, I would consider looking at S&DS 230from what my friends taking the course have told me, it is less of an emphasis on learning statistical methods and rather a greater emphasis on R. I can not complain, however, because S&DS 220 was very well taught. ",

Since she is leaving Yale, I have no idea what the course will look like in future years. Regardless, though, the amount of content that one is exposed to in S&DS 220, as long as you are willing to put in the work and truly understand statistics, will make you a better, more intelligent, and practical person regardless of what discipline or major you choose to pursue. An understanding of statistics is, I feel, essential to being a well-rounded individual. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course especially to students who may have had some stats in high school but may not feel ready diving into a more advanced course. Stats is the core of this course, not programming, meaning that you cannot just google how to code something and do well in the class, you actually need to know the stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you have the time in your schedule to do it. The problem sets every week take up time, and the class being at 9:00 am was pretty tough as well. ",

Especially if you haven't taken AP Stat but want a more a quantitative intro to stat than the 100 series, 220 is perfect for you. I thought it wasn't too challenging, but I also learned a lot, and I feel like I have a solid foundation in statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that of all the introductory statistics courses at Yale, this course provides the most comprehensive understanding of statistical analysis, and theory. The course does not merely present formulas, but explains the mathematical basis for these formulas and their applications in statistical computing. The statistical analyses taught in this course are thus made meaningful in a way that students understand them deeply enough to independently apply them outside of course assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is great for anyone who wants a basic roster of statistical analysis skills. Very important stuff for the modern world! And very applicable to careers spanning multiple diverse fields! And it's well-taught, really fun, and an approachable entry point to data science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is an extremely useful, large, and compact overview of statistics that can help students majoring in almost any subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Extremely good foundational course in statistics (but especially if you get Prof. Wang). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are curious about statistics take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think if you're interested in learning statistics this is the class to take ",
            "\u00a0Yes well organized well taught not terribly hard great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you havent taken AP stats already. Its really interesting to learn what underlies the statistical tests (like p-tests) that are so central to statistics used in science. Its also a good chance to get a computational approach to statistics that feels very applicable.  Material definitely can be boring if youre not interested in statistics however. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great intro class but don't take if you already took AP ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students interested in stats and who have had some experience in coding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a solid introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, no matter their math or statistics background. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Best lecture I've taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I thought the class was well-run and well-taught, and all the example exercises and application topics were wide-ranging, highlighting just how important this field is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is very useful and fun ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would for anyone curious about statistics or looking to start a professional journey, this is the course for it! Very well taught, organized and assessed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone who hasn't had any exposure to statistics and wants to learn R simultaneously, this is a good course ",
            "\u00a0If this is the intensive class, I don't think taking a lower level class would have been rewarding enough for me personally, so if you feel like you already have okay-ish quantitative reasoning skills and even a VERY basic understanding of coding, you should probably take this as the intro class. There is very little assumed knowledge.\r\nIf you aren't really a mathy or quantitatively oriented person, maybe consider the 100 level courses. (I haven't taken them, so I just assume they are more oriented for less experienced students) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for someone with no knowledge of statistics and a desire to learn--with some stats knowledge it may be possible to coast, but without that it requires significant engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone interested in stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, becauses stats is a great skill to have and you get to learn how to use R at a slow enough pace but I would say that you do need to take more classes to learn more complex stuff. We only covered basic intro stats ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good introduction to statistics and r-coding. I know she's leaving Yale, but Professor Wang was absolutely amazing. Very practical and approachable. She has so much industry experience that really added to what we were doing in class. ",
            "\u00a0It's a true shame that Prof. Wang is leaving, as I would wholeheartedly recommend this class (and probably any) with her. From talking with other students, it seems like she really \"made\" this class for so many people. I'd say: so long as you feel some rapport with whoever may be teaching it, go for it, and don't be too scared by the \"intensive\" title. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but only based on the subject not the course itself.  While the topic of statistics interests me, the content of the course itself was relatively small and learning R was not prioritized. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student since R is a very useful statistical tool and can be used in many fields and this course gives a good introduction into how to use it. "
