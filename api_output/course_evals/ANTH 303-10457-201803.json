            "\u00a0How to conduct ethnographic field methods and how to read ethnographies for critical analysis of methods! ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to conduct fieldwork and do ethnographic work on a small scale. If you're interested in doing ethnography I would recommend ",
            "\u00a0The ability to think critically about the study of people! A really well-rounded understanding of ethnographic field methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about anthropological theory, methods and about anthropology as a field more generally. I was surprised at how everyone in the classroom loved anthropology. Although my classmate did not put in that much work for our final project, it was really cool to do a collaborative ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0different types of methodology in ethnographic research and practice utilizing them/understanding their limitations\r\nthis class was a great balance of being critical but then having to find practical solutions to those critiques because we were placed in the position of those we were critiquing ",
            "\u00a0I am honestly not very certain what I \"developed\" during this course, and from what we talked about at the end of it that seemed to be purposeful. I feel like my desire to do anthropology has definitely decreased, and I don't necessarily view that as a failing of the course. If anything, the course did its job by pointing me into new fields and directions. I would say that I learned that much of what makes anthropological methods successful is just a willingness to put oneself \"out there\" and learn by doing. Theory and discussion only takes you so far. I also learned what I liked and didn't like about anthropological writing and I feel like my writing skills improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a groundwork for anthropological ethnography and fieldwork. It provides examples of ethnography, and instances to practice doing ethnographic work in the form of a semester-long ethnographic project that is conducted at the Yale Law School. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ethnographic field methods, both theoretically and in practice. I particularly enjoyed the set up of the readings, where we would have a series of theoretical readings accompanied by an ethnography in which we actually see the theory/method being used in practice. We also touched on applications of ethnography, with SLvB bringing in her own experience as an ethnographic consultant which was extremely enriching (and probably my favorite week). We also touched on more high-level, deeper questions like what the purpose of anthropology and ethnography are. This course was also extremely good about making me think critically and ask critical questions, particularly of ethnography. SLvB did not shy away from criticizing her own discipline and its methods. I really admire this aspect of the course; it added so much more depth to it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest thing I took away from this course was a healthy skepticism of ethnographic methods and how they can be adapted and changed with current cultural and societal developments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct various cultural anthropology field methods including participant observation, unstructured and structured interviews, kinship charts, and ethnographic film. "

            "\u00a0Main Strength: Diverse members of the field teaching the course, leading to interesting perspectives on the work in practice\r\nMain Weakness: Shallow... Could benefit from more in-depth readings, better discussions of actual ethnographic texts, stronger connections between assignments. Caught between being an introductory course and a more advanced course. Needs to decide on direction.\r\nRoom for improvement: There's a gap between the theories we learn, the skills we are practicing, and how these get implemented in actual ethnographic texts and other works/fields. More focused readings and discussions of the skills in practice (how/why does this researcher/author do this?) may be beneficial. Furthermore, an overarching project on a particular theme - where the student gets to demonstrate a semester's worth of learning and must think critically about what techniques/styles they want to implement - in addition to small exercises (that do not require a theme) might be beneficial, rather than having a collection of exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Field methods had incredibly interesting, challenging, demanding, and fun assignments revolving around a theme for the whole semester, and Professor Le Baron von Bayer is outstanding and worth getting to know if she teaches the class again! I learned so much about how to look at things in a completely different way. Weakness is that directions and guidance for write ups were incredibly unclear, and grading routinely penalized us for things it seemed we should have just magically known to include or do. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses whatsoever .The class was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the project was a great opportunity to put something into practice in the REAL world.\r\nWeakness: This is a weakness in anthropology overall but I think more decolonization of methods and theory would be ideal. We should move towards advancing the field by brainstorming, criticizing and analyzing ways to decolonize anthropology and it's methods.  We should also engage more with the public in a way that our work is more effective and valuable to the communities we aim to serve. \r\n\r\nSomething that stood out to me was at the end of the class, Prof, SvLB told us that the anthro department was not hiring or retaining women/women of color professors. Should we use the skills and method of anthropology to analyze, to investigate and to hold Yale accountable to teach us more? To go further and to hire diverse voices?  I think the analyzing the law school was good but using our time, energy and efforts to criticize yale in the hopes of making it fairer and better would be more productive. How would that take place? Op-eds? historical analysis of yale hiring methods? I'm not sure but it's a question worth answering. ",
            "\u00a0it was a great course for what it aims to do! ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course was that we were not able to select our own topics, because we all researched the Yale Law School. While this may have been good for students who needed some extra guidance, I found it frustrating. Another weakness of the course was that we spent a lot of time problematizing anthropology without necessarily arriving at any deeper personal understanding for why anthropology is important. The strengths of the course were definitely in the pacing. The workload was consistent and doable throughout the semester. Furthermore, the course did its job in addressing methods. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course started off well in its approach, by talking about the basics of anthropological fieldwork, in writing ethnography, and engaging critically with the work that one produces as an anthropologist. However, I really disliked the fact that the semester-long ethnography project was limited to being done in the law school. I felt limited in the work that I could produce, and many times, the individual assignments were not always the most ideal strategies for approaching writing about the Law School. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TF were excellent, and the cumulative assignments were very helpful to put the knowledge from readings and discussions into practice. This class allowed me to explore both anthropology and Yale in an entirely new way -- I would wholeheartedly recommend this course and the professor to all students. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: SLvB is hands-down one of the most incredible, brilliant professors I have ever encountered at Yale. I remember her telling us that she is a non-ladder faculty and may be leaving Yale at the end of the spring semester. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have met her and taken a class with her here. She is engaging in discussion, and in particular is able to maneuver between being a professor and kind of a \"co-investigator\" in seminar with us extremely well. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: There was a TF for this class (Matthew). I'm not really sure what his role was, except for occasionally contributing to seminar discussion or helping out with the seminar. His grading was quite erratic and I think with both him and SLvB grading assignments, it led to some unfortunate incidents of double standards and unfair grades. Additionally, our seminar in particular had one student who was extremely rude in class - would clearly not listen to other students while they were contributing, made side comments under their breathand on several occasionstook out a bag of tobacco and rolling papers and rolled a cigarette in seminar. I wish SLvB would have said something about this inappropriate behavior because it was honestly distracting (especially the rolling a cigarette in seminar part). ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the readings felt repetitive, and/or were not relevant to the discussion. This may also have to do with the number of readings, sometimes felt excessive. That being said, reading the actual ethnographies was always a highlight, and I did wish discussions could center around them more. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the hands-on experience actually engaging in field methods, and the fact that we embarked on our semester \"ethnographies\" in groups. I also enjoyed our in-depth discussions about methods practice and ethics in class, which I thought were structured well. One recommendation I have is to allow flexibility with regards to how well a given assignment aligns with the group's theme since it can be challenging to access people at the law school. "

            "\u00a0If the desire is to sharpen hard skills, then yes. Not a good course for students with limited exposure to ethnographic work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, anyone interested in ethnography should take this course. You learn theory and you practice it at the same time ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great way to learn more about anthropology and to read a bunch of ethnographies that are diverse, challenging and valuable. Take it! ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students with little experience doing anthropological research or with anthropology in general. I would not recommend this course for students who have already done a significant amount of anthropological coursework. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone just starting out with anthropology. I was sometimes disappointed by the material we were covering as someone who has taken anthropology courses before, because there wasn't too much new material that I was getting out of the course, and this class probably would have served me better as an introduction to anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're an anthro major or have taken anthro classes before an want to get a solid understanding but critical perspective of the methods used in the discipline. But be warned that there is quite a lot of reading for each week. Granted you don't have to do all of it and can certainly skim, every week on Sunday we had to submit discussion questions based on the readings so it was clear if you did the readings and whether you did them well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course -- the class structure is good, and the assignments that form part of the larger semester-long project are engaging. Professor LeBaron Von-Baeyer is absolutely wonderful and has been one of the best instructors and sections leaders that I have had in my three years at Yale. She probes for the discussion to go further without guiding students to any specific point of view or answer -- she is thoughtful and insightful, but approachable and kind. The material and readings were not overwhelming and the material was thought-provoking enough. I really liked that we were able to tie all of our work from the semester into one project, and that we were able to often work in teams. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I took this course as a non-major as someone looking to use ethnographic methods in future studies and found it accessible to me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they are considering a thesis in cultural anthropology "
