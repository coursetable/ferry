            "\u00a0I became better at making my essays clear, but less formulaic than they were before. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to better close read poetry by being a patient reader of poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I not only read poetry to understand its meaning but I took into account the syntax, meter, and punctuation of each poem and how this connected to the poet's intentions. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to analyze the poetry of different writers such as Brooks and Bishop, as well as convey my ideas through clear and artful writing as well as in class discussions. "

            "\u00a0Professor Glaser truly has such a depth of poetry knowledge. Under his guidance (and with the help of a class full of  well-prepared peers), our conversations flourished and were full of insights. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong because it only focuses on so many readings. There arent so many readings that the course feels overwhelming. But there are enough readings to have some diversity and learn different ways to close read. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material was strong and included many women poets which is important. I really enjoyed the writing entries because it forced us to really think about the poems. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. The works we read helped me to unravel themes of connection, nature, solitude, and identity. Professor Glaser focused on line-by-line interpretations as well, which I thought was very helpful in understanding the larger scope of a text as well. I also was able to communicate with my peers and learn from their ideas. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed the broad range of poems that we covered. I was blessed to have some very-well prepared peers this semester, and because of their willingness to participate and verbalize questions, I felt like we always ended up with a greater understanding of the poetry we covered by the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who likes to read and would like to become a more careful reader. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am not an english major and I'm really glad I took this class because it exposed me to many great poets that I wouldn't have found on my own. The classes were filled with great discussions that were led by students most of the time. Even if you're not a writer but are interested in poetry it really helps and opens up a new way of reading poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This is a good introduction to English poetry and you should take it even if youre not considering the English major. Its taught in an accessible way, and you learn how to craft an essay and connect authors to one another. "
