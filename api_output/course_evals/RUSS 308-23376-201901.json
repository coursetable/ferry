            "\u00a0Interesting survey course of Russian operas from early 1800s up to the 1930s. Good exposure to a genre I otherwise knew nothing about. Class was pretty small and discussions were interesting. Blog posts for each opera (every week or two) kept us accountable for the material and made sure that people came to class prepared. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Russian opera, and the importance of Russian culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Russian operatic tradition. I learned about specific shows, and through these in depth discussions learned how to approach other Russian operas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the musical and dramatic context of various Russian operas. I also learned the historical and biographical context behind their creation. I also developed my skills at watching, understanding, and analyzing operas and scenes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Russian operatic tradition as a facet of Russian cultural history in the 19th and 20th centuries. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I gained not only insight pertaining to the musical content of opera, but also the history and literature behind it all. It was fascinating to walk through recent Russian history via opera. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I liked that there were two professors. Professors McCreless and Titus each brought something different. His commentary was much more about the music and hers was about the cultural and literary backdrop to each opera. Good balance. ",
            "\u00a0I liked some operas that we discussed more than others, so maybe switching up the line up of operas would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the course, especially how we got feedback on our reading responses and how the instructors clearly read them before our discussions. The only thing I would change would be to omit the Danish production of Lady Macbeth since it was disturbing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the professors who offered seemingly endless knowledge about the music, history, literature, etc. I think the course could be improved by holding more viewings as a class, rather than watching an opera on ones own. This doesnt have to be every week, just a few group viewings. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it. The musical analysis parts of lecture might be a bit complex for someone with no background in music, but anyone interested in music (and especially music majors) would learn a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in opera or Russian culture, you should definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to my peers. I would especially recommend it if they think that the historical overview courses in the music major would be too broad to be engaging. I personally get a lot more out of really focusing on one topic and connecting that to my knowledge from other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, as I found it one of the most exciting and interesting courses I have taken at Yale yet. "
