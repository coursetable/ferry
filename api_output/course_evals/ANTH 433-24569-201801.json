            "\u00a0This course provides a broad yet nuanced overview of reproductive justice and reproductive experiences. Most of the ethnographies are in the US, however the issues addressed also tie into the reproductive realities around the globe. This course taught me to think critically about reproductive justice beyond the narrow lens of abortion and choice, as well as the value of ethnography especially for policy applications. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critique ethnography effectively and fairly. I learned a whole lot about reproductive justice as a theoretical framework, a topic with which I was not all that familiar before taking this course. I developed a lot of insights into the field of anthropology as a whole; its history, methodology, and associations with other fields and activist work. ",
            "\u00a0The course introduced me to the concept of Reproductive Justice, a framework that takes reproductive politics beyond the pro-life pro-choice debate, and connects reproductive politics to a wide range of other social issues like incarceration, racial discrimination etc. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing ethnographic methods and thinking critically about ethnographies ",
            "\u00a0Such a wonderful expansive view into reproductive justice, covering topics from abortion to health care for Native American women to racialization in hospitals to Indian surrogacy to reproducing while queer and more. For me, as someone who hadn't taken a lot of anthropology, it was also a wonderful deep dive into the work of ethnographies and the questions that anthropologists grapple with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply the principles of reproductive justice to various topics and critically analyze ethnographic work. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that you get such a great survey of current works on reproductive justice. While the weekly responses were taxing at times, I felt that they encouraged me to think more critically about the readings before class. I also enjoyed the blog format that we used that allowed us to engage with each other. Additionally the responses meant that everyone came to class prepared to discuss which was a very welcome change from other seminars where a large portion of the class doesnt do the readings. I think his course would have benefited from a required but ungraded two page proposal in the midterm to encourage students to think of their topic early and get feedback from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were excellent and complimented each other well - we really built on a lot of concepts over the course of the semester. I really liked the reading responses posted to the class blog, and the requirement to read everyone else's, which I haven't done in other classes. Discussion definitely benefitted from our having already engaged with the readings and each other. I also really liked the use of multimedia in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the course. I loved having a class tumblr on which we could share social media items related to the course material, particularly because of how much daily relevance the course had in our day and age. I loved the way we had weekly writing responses that allowed us to engage with the topics broached in our ethnographies but that these weekly writing responses were shared on the tumblr instead of a more formal platform as it took some stress away from writing them. I also really appreciated how professor newman allowed us to write a final research proposal instead of an essay for the course. particularly for anthropology courses, writing research papers without having done fieldwork always seems a little strange and disconnected from the discipline for me so I appreciated that we got to do that. \r\n\r\nI do wish we had received feedback on our weekly writing responses along the way given that that was the only work we had submitted before the final. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the structure of having one person present each class followed by a group discussion. However, I think there could have been more feedback given through out the year (on reading responses, participation, or whatever else we were graded on). It was a bit unsettling to have our final paper be the only officially graded assignment. I also think the assignments could all have a bit more structure to guide us in the right direction at the onset. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great reading selection, super expansive and interesting; I liked the student presentations and great class discussions; professor Newman did a good job of leading conversations; wonderful group of thoughtful students.\r\nWeaknesses: I always find 9am seminars a little hard since people are still sleepy so the conversation sometimes isn't as strong. For student presentations, I would encourage students to do a little more on new things/knowledge/perspectives they can add to the readings rather than summarizing (sometimes the summaries would go on for a while and we had already done the readings). Would maybe be nice to receive more feedback throughout the class since we had no known graded assignments/feedback throughout. \r\n\r\nOverall, really wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the class discussions, the readings; I always felt like the discussion was very student driven, but still learned something every class from Professor Newman\r\nWeaknesses: some more feedback in the form of smaller assignments/grades throughout the semester might have been helpful "

            "\u00a0Take this course!!! While Professor Newman will sadly not be teaching next year, if a similar course is offered take it! This class honestly changed my life and gave me a greater sense of direction. You will learn a lot from the readings especially on topics not really covered or addresses. Reproductive justice really is the future and ties into so many other inequities - gender, class, race. I especially encourage men to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes very much so and I truly wish Prof Newman was still going to be here next year so that I could actually make this recommendation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Such an awesome topic with a really expansive lens. I've always been someone interested in RJ and have worked in advocacy around it before, but I still learned so so so much about topics I had never considered/thought about (from health care for Native American women to racialization in hospitals to Indian surrogacy to reproducing while queer and more). Good reading list and really great discussions! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, this was my favorite class this semester; it challenged me in so many amazing ways! "
