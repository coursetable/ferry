I find that psych studies are often to correlational and specific ",
            "\u00a0This course consisted of writing pieces of research papers about class experiments. It was a very loose course structure, but Professor Rand was brutally honest about that up front. It was pretty fun. It was about what research is really like. ",

            "\u00a0This course did not have a syllabus at the beginning, and it's probably one of the central faults. Also, some of the assignments we did were so pointless, especially because we got so little feedback about those assignments. Ok, so we got randomly graded on some assignments. But why did we receive the grade we did? How could we improve? We did not get that. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the strengths were that we did experiments as a group and that the professor showed us different ways to analyste the data in class. I also liked when he showed the flaws in published research. I thought there could have been more assigned reading. ",

            "\u00a0This course was definitely unlike any I've taken before. It was very much an \"adventure\" as Professor Rand announced at the beginning of the year, and I loved learning and discussing about game theory and how it could be used to test for various economic and social behaviors. Getting to come up with our own experiments and running them as a class, to then see the results and discuss them a week after, always made me look forward to coming to class. However, the class did not match its description in the Yale Blue Book, as it was instead a lot more focused on experiments instead of theory. I would have also appreciated, despite the large size of the class, for each student to get to design their own experiments, but running them as a class was also a really fun experience. ",

            "\u00a0For the research methods requirement, absolutely! I have heard that research methods courses can be pretty boring, but this one was cool. Professor Rand talked about mistakes he had made in research. Lots of guest lectures. ",

It's just a great way to see what research is like and gives you insight into how to interpret the literature in the field. Unfortunately Professor David Rand won't be teaching this course next semester, so I won't know for sure what is in store for this class for prospective students. ",

            "\u00a0If youre lucky enough to have a chance to interact with david Rand in your life, do it, hes cool. As to this course, hes leaving so I have no idea what it will look like, but the general topics were interesting, some fun game theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are a psych student you have to take a research methods class anyway. It was really useful but not overboard. "
