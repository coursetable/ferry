The HW and exam is in a very reasonable difficulty and amount. \r\n\r\nMight allow more engaging if there is a mini project during the semester so students can collaborate and work on a small real problem?? ",

This could substantially improve our real-time data experience.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n1. Insanely responsive instructor! Susan is doing really good on providing feedback on almost every student! This is incredible~!\r\n2. Piazza made it wonderful to communicate with fellow students, Susan, and teaching assistants. Making it a very interactive class.\r\n3. Very helpful homework problem sets.\r\n4. Well-designed and -organized canvas tabs and lectures. ",
