            "\u00a0The course provided a view of the Enlightenment 'from below' and 'from the margins' by considering (1) less canonical authors and (2) less canonical texts by the 'grands philosophes'. Particular attention was given to the various figures of alterity in 18th-century literature (namely, colonial subjects, feral children, etc.). "

        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus was clearly structured and well organized, and the premise of the course-- to interrogate the philosophy of the Enlightenment from its margins-- was theoretically interesting. The course paired primary texts with relevant secondary literature, which was helpful and provided a sense of the field. I would have appreciated more interventions from Professor Saint-Amand, since when he did intervene his readings and comments often opened up new possibility and shed light on the texts in interesting ways. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes-- I think the course offers an important 'counterpoint' to more traditional treatments of Enlightenment thought and culture and reinscribes the histories of colonialism and alterity that remain imminently legible but often ignored in 18th-century literature. "
