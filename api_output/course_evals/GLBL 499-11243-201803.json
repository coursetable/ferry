            "\u00a0This course taught me all about client management, handling deadlines, working as a team, communicating obstacles, and creating a cohesive product with many different perspectives. I learned all about Liberia, youth unemployment, the underlying causes of such unemployment, and the effectiveness of on-the-ground approaches in combatting youth unemployment. I learned how to create a one-pager, present work that is in-progress, and hold myself and others accountable. ",
            "\u00a0I did not develop any knowledge, skills or insights by taking this class. It was merely an exercise in managing Prof. O'Brien's expectations versus the client's. It was almost as though we had 2 clients at once. I guess one thing that I did learn is that almost none of the insights we would get in a traditional development class apply to real life. ",
            "\u00a0You certainly learn a lot in a very non-traditional way (as compared to classroom learning). I learned about client management (communication, presentation, managing expectations, etc.), team dynamics, advanced research skills, practice in gathering insight and delivering on conclusions, presenting skills, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging, interesting subject matter, client management skills acquired, Professor O'Brien is great and wants you to succeed\r\nWeaknesses: it was hard to get interviews, very hard to meet some of the deadlines, the fragmentation into 3 countries made it hard to spend a lot of time together in one place -- we only met as a team during the seminars and in the last few weeks ",
            "\u00a0I think the entire capstone establishment is misguided: I do not see the point in having real-world experience in college when we have all the time and opportunity to have real-world experience in the real world. But specifically, I thought that the instructor could have been more organized in her approach to class, most of the times the class time was spent filling her in on recent developments, and things she should have known by being cc'ed on emails. ",
            "\u00a0I was so expectant of  this course but was really disappointed. There is so much less guidance from administration than you would have thought. Although when doing the final presentations, you would think it is worth it. It really didn't have to be so stressful ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Incredible opportunity to work with the World Bank -- I think this was at times lost on our group in the middle of the (sometimes frustrating) work, but wow, it is truly such an honor to work with a group like the World Bank. As someone interested in the development world, it certainly provided special insight into different groups in that field. As the WB/Yale name carried some weight, we got to talk to really incredible people at different organizations and projects (USAID, DAI, FHI 360, Mercy Corps, Former Jordanian Diplomat, etc). At the end of the day, the work we were doing was really cool! Additionally, at its best, you get to work with a great group of students who all bring different perspectives and ideas. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Because our project was divided into three smaller projects, I think team organizing was quite difficult, which was especially challenging when we only met with our professor once a week. With three smaller projects, I think it was harder for Professor O'Brien to provide leadership for our diverging work and timelines. With less on the ground leadership provided by a professor, equal work division and project vision/details was/were a lot harder -- I think our group struggled as some people contributed a lot less than others, with some individuals more interested in bare minimum work for the grade than the actual project itself. Lastly, I was really disappointed by Jackson's lack of support throughout the project. Communication was sparse and often confusing, coming through our professor rather than directly to students (for instance: no clear guidelines on overall expectations from Jackson, date and time for final presentation were changed multiple times and communicated to students at last minute -- in fact, the final presentation was scheduled to last 45 minutes later than I was ever told thus I sadly had to miss 4 groups because of prior scheduling). Furthermore, our client Skype presentation in December was incredibly disappointing because we worked really hard to prepare but ended up being scheduled in a tiny room in the basement of WLH with no group video camera (had to pass around a laptop to speak) and technical issues, thereby feeling quite unprofessional. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Despite being quite difficult at times, I think this is an incredibly special opportunity that I would love to see continued and improved. I think there should be more support from Jackson throughout the project: better communication, improved efforts to connect us to relevant contacts, organized meetings between capstone groups to support one another (share ideas, discuss difficulties and best practices, etc.), more support in editing, final product expectations, etc. I also think this project would be hugely improved if it officially met twice a week. I know it is a lot to ask out of state professors to come in more than once, but it would be really great if we could have one normal class per week and one other official meeting time (maybe professor skypes in). Our group had unofficial weekly meetings, but it was often difficult to get everyone there for a meaningful amount of time, lending itself to constant unequal distribution of work. I think more official class time will help with coordinating efforts and help the professor stay more up-to-date on project progress, thereby allowing them to take more leadership on the project, group dynamics, etc. (it often felt like class time was mostly spent catching our professor up on where we were, which felt a bit wasted and sometimes even made things more confusing). Finally, encourage students to start researching/project EARLY -- our client canceled twice in beginning, giving us a late start which I think we all felt at the end! "

            "\u00a0You will be taking a Capstone regardless, but it is absolutely worth taking one with Professor O'Brien! It was challenging and sometimes stressful, but overall very fascinating and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it as a global major. I would recommend that thesis classes should be offered as an option. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, it is unclear what they hoped to achieve with the capstone. Was a good experience but I would have been able to do more in depth work if I had written a thesis for another major. ",
            "\u00a0My experience was definitely difficult -- I worked a ton (worked on it most days of the week; often staying up to 3/4am the night before class) with very little support from teammates which made for an often frustrating group dynamic. However, I actually do really think this class is worthwhile: you learn a lot about your own working styles and desires/expectations for a team, project leadership, client leadership, project direction, etc; it exposes you to incredible individuals, organizations, and projects in a field of interest; it more mimics post-grad work life; it feels meaningful beyond a paper or in-class work; etc. I would just say go in with an open mind, try to maintain excitement for the project, and be ready to work hard!
