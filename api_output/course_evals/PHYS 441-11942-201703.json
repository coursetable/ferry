            "\u00a0This class is an interesting continuation of PHYS 440. You'll learn applications of the things you have learned, including very powerful approximation techniques. I was a bit disappointed that more of the course was not on the big picture of quantum mechanics. Learning about the EPR paradox was fun and I for instance wish we had spent more time on it. Comparing various interpretations of quantum mechanics would have been more interesting to me than to go over, say, quantum scattering. Also, I felt like the class was more computation/less conceptual than it had been in PHYS 440. ",
            "\u00a0Quantum 2 is a really great follow up to 440. It really helped my quantum intuition and problem solving ability. Rather than doing loads and loads of differential equations, you learn a lot about the meaning and significance of quantum physics. The interstice into quantum computing was also very cool. ",
            "\u00a0This is just a continuation of Quantum I: you learn addition of angular momenta, symmetries, perturbation theory, the variational principle, quantum computing, WKB approximation, scattering theory, and path integrals, to various degrees of rigor. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of different applications and approximation methods of the theory covered in 440- including perturbation theory, the variational principle, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much! I found that this course really solidified my mathematical understanding of quantum after taking 440 (I won't say intuitive here as it is impossible to have an intuitive understanding of quantum). The course focused on exploring some of the more applied areas of quantum (i.e. computation, cryptography, approximation methods, and much much more). It was a super interesting classIll be sad not to have it in my schedule next semester! ",
            "\u00a0The remainder of Griffiths: addition of angular momentum (spin), perturbation theory (time independent and time-dependent), the variational method, WKB, three dimensional scattering, as well as basic quantum information theory and the path-integral formulation. Conceptually you learned all the main points of quantum mechanics in the first semester. This semester is more about understanding specific systems (read: everything you can do to the hydrogen atom). ",
            "\u00a0I extended what I learned in the first semester of quantum mechanics to many various applications. I am much better at quantum mechanics now! ",
            "\u00a0In the second semester of Quantum Mechanics I became so much more comfortable with the material. Needing to apply first semester topics like the 1-d harmonic oscillator and the Hydrogen atom in new ways, using spin in both addition of angular momentum and the quantum computing unit, etc. all reinforced that knowledge pretty strongly. Additionally, the new topics in analytical and numeric approximations for quantum systems that aren't analytically solvable was very interesting 1) because I feel like I got good intuition about how degenerates break and 2) seeing that these results so closely matched the experimental results of our world (to 15 decimal places) was so satisfying. This class forced me to learn constantly and, even if I didn't do as well as I would have wished on exams, I did, for example, totally crush a question on the final that I hadn't really understood on the midterm. I feel like this class marked a pretty significant transition in me as a scientist and just as a person trying to understand this universe we find ourselves in, and measuring by how much I learned I am very happy and can't wait for QFT. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about how to apply the knowledge of quantum I to interesting and new problems. Skiba also gave us great intuition and ways of thinking about quantum in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about quantum mechanics, particularly about how to deal with quantum systems that are too complex to have exact analytic solutions. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about quantum mechanics as a continuation of the previous semester. More focus was placed in approximations and derivations of important results in quantum mechanics rather than how to approach general problems. ",
            "\u00a0As a continuation of 440, this course provided a more in-depth understanding of intro quantum mechanics, building on the previous semester. By the end of the course I definitely had a better understanding of QM and feel better prepared for more in-depth courses in this topic. "

            "\u00a0Overall, PHYS441 is a wonderful course. It moves VERY VERY quickly, but it's information that needs to be covered and I'm not sure if there's anything that can be don to slow it down. ",
            "\u00a0Skiba is amazing and the material, in my opinion, is even more interesting than Quantum I. Obviously, this course is quite math-heavy; if you're a physics major, this really shouldn't be an issue. The homework was very informative but quite reasonable in length. Exams seemed fair (fingers crossed!). Skiba sometimes presents a different treatment than Griffiths, which can get a little bit confusing, but his way is usually better anyway. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great, not sure I would change anything. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Literally none. Maybe only that it is only a semester long? Would love to learn much more about this stuff.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Skiba is incredible! He makes really informative problem sets and genuinely cares about the class. As mentioned before, the material is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fine. I think serious physics majors could benefit to exposure outside of Griffiths. Shankar teaches here, why don't we have problems/ readings from his textbook? ",
            "\u00a0Skiba teaches this course very well. The main strength of the course are his lectures. Perhaps an improvement would be to have the class as Monday/Wednesday, rather than Monday/Wednesday/Friday, but I think that's a controversial issue. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this course is pretty great and I don't really have any criticisms. Obviously there is still a lot I don't understand, I still don't really know what spin is, or what a measurement is, and while I come out of it with a good start to a theoretical knowledge of quantum mechanics I feel a lot of empirical anxiety and I want to go test things myself. I am a very visual and spatial learner so I would have appreciated more simulations to build intuitive understanding. Even like, MATLAB code that we could run at home and see time evolution of systems and edit with varying degrees of proficiency would have been nice. I also acknowledge that this is something I should just do myself now that I have the math. ",
            "\u00a0The material and professor are fantastic. I especially appreciated Skiba's homework questions and conceptual backpage problems that really helped us think about the material. The courses did not have any major weaknesses; maybe partial wave analysis was covered a bit quickly at the end, but that was about my only complaint. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 441 was good, although it often felt like a survey course. We skimmed most of the topics, and there were several subjects, such as quantum computing, that I would have enjoyed learning more about. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if it's taught by Skiba-- he really cares about the students and the material he's teaching, and it comes through in his lecture style and attentiveness to questions. Lovely class. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, the class lectures tended to line up with the textbook, which was very helpful. The lectures were also really engaging and asking questions was actively encouraged. However, as an intro class, certain topics felt like they were covered very quickly or not in enough depth. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0As the companion course to Physics 440, Physics 441 covers not only topics that are covered in Griffiths' textbook and thus might be considered required fare for an undergraduate course (such as perturbation theory, the WKB approximation, the variational principle, and scattering), but also symmetries, quantum computing, and Feynman's path integral formulation. Skiba is an excellent lecturer, and the material is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone who has an interest in Physics, Mathematics, or pretty much any logic-oriented field of study should take this course. It's a lot of work, but very good. The textbook is clear and Prof. Skiba (hopefully he teaches the course in the future) is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn a ton of amazing concepts in this course (my personal favorite was quantum computing), and Skiba is excellent. In some sense, in both this course and Quantum I, the abstractness somewhat levels the playing field as far as physics background goes. I think this makes the quantum sequence accessible to anyone that is willing to put in the work, without having much physics background. To that end, I would strongly encourage anyone (read: not just physics majors) that is somewhat strong at math to take these courses if Skiba is still teaching it; you will learn a lot of interesting things from an amazing professor, get an SC credit, and have a good sense of accomplishment at the end of it. ",
            "\u00a010/10 would recommend. 441 goes through the approximation methods and applications in the second half of Griffiths, and covers some additional topics-- in our case, symmetries and quantum computing. Skiba is a great lecturer, and it's definitely worthwhile to take if he teaches it again! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you arent a physics major, this class is super interesting and informative! ",
            "\u00a0Sure. I don't think this course is going to be a superlative in any way: it won't be the hardest class, it won't be the most exciting, nor the most important. But it is valuable material and you have to take it and it won't kill you. Weekly problem sets a midterm, final, the usual. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are in the physics track, don't skip over the second semester of quantum. You get to apply a lot of what you learned first semester. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course. If you are considering it, you probably already took 440 so let me say this, Quantum Mechanics is a topic that you get more out of the more time you spend with it. I found that applying first semester topics in second semester did a lot to reinforce my learning and fill in gaps that I still had after 440. Additionally, Perturbation Theory, the Variational Method, WKB, Scattering, Quantum Computing, and Path integral Formulation are all very useful and/or interesting topics. Also, Skiba is a legend and rightfully so. Go to his office hours. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS A GREAT COURSE ESPECIALLY WITH SKIBA! Quantum II is really fun. You get to finally apply and understand all the formalism you built up in Quantum I to great problems. Skiba is incredible: kind, clear, enthusiastic, and very generous with his time. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoyed Physics 440, you will probably also enjoy 441. It's a much more experimental course, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on your temperament. The work load was medium, and I enjoyed most of the topics, although the lectures were generally less engaging and harder to follow than they were in 440. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! You learn all the applications of what you learned in 440. Skiba is an awesome professor, and the TAs are usually super helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if Skiba is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for intensive physics majors as it is part of the required courses. I know several students not in the major also took both quantum courses but only Quantum 1 seemed useful for them. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from the fact that the course is required for the intensive physics major, I would recommend taking the class if you have taken 440, since the first half of the course is frequently referenced. Generally speaking 441 built on topics from the previous semester really smoothly, which ultimately made the course a really enriching experience. "
