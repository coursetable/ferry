            "\u00a0I have learned how to read an image without referring to texts. It enables me to reflect on the difference of textual logic and the visual logic. And it does help in English writing.\r\nAlso important is how to appreciate Tibetan Buddhist images, which is important in understanding Tibetan culture and also esoteric Buddhism. ",

            "\u00a0The course's reading materials are carefully selected and can benefit us a lot in understanding visual arts and Tibetan Buddhism.\r\nThe assignment is also well designed, and the atmosphere is relaxed. We are encouraged to raise questions and engage in the discussion. The presentation part is also a great opportunity to help us build the skills of giving a speech.\r\nThe final project is excellent. It is perhaps the first time we are involved in a real research project and it is a pioneering work.\r\nIf this course is only open for graduate students, it may go deeper in its contents. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: so many materials and deep discussion, and insightful readings. And the wonderful experience of seeing ancient Tangkas.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe we could learn more techniques and methods to analyze religious paintings and Tangkas. "
