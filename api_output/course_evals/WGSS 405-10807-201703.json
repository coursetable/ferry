            "\u00a0I learned about Chinese history, the role of women in Chinese history, and the factors influencing women's poetry in Traditional China ",
            "\u00a0I learned about women in ancient Chinese literature and some different cultural ways that men and women interacted that manifested themselves in the literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history and culture of China from the Han Dynasty to today through the lens of women's poetry. We learned how to identify recurring images and tropes in women's poetry, compare the poetry of different classes and eras of women, and explore how both male and female poets conceptualize women in their writing. Through essays and discussion, we were able to engage closely with both the historical context in which these women wrote and their poetry itself. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a fascinating field by the person who essentially founded it in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows you to gain in-depth knowledge of Chinese Women's literature. The chronological and thematic outlines of the course allow for an understanding of traditional themes and trends within women's literature and how it developed throughout time. Understanding of the role of literature in culture also allows for an understanding of how Chinese culture changed across dynasties. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to closely read poetry and write analytical papers in the context of Chinese poetry written by women. ",
            "\u00a0I came away with an understanding of the socio-political forces affecting women (and men) in traditional Chinese culture, and how different poets responded to and shaped those forces. This course also does a great job in appreciating the poetry for its own sake, as well as developing close analysis skills. The material studied in this course was a great comparison to more Western-oriented poetry and mindsets, and helped to put them in context. "

            "\u00a0Strengths-- Professor Chang is incredibly sweet and kind. She's a knowledgable lecturer and is a leading scholar in the field. The poems we read were carefully selected ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of really interesting content which was a strength, however the way it was taught was not conducive to taking advantage of the content's full potential. Parts of the course were a bit dry. This may be because of the structure of the course - the lectures were too long and there was not enough class discussion. The readings also got repetitive instead of having just a few poems and really discussing them in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a myriad of strengths. The readings are incredibly interesting and nothing like what I've read before. It's wonderfully refreshing to read almost exclusively female writers, and learning about the history of China through this context is very thought-provoking. The class is well structured as we explore female poets by theme (courtesans, widow poets, etc.), which I thought was helpful in writing papers as it made recurring imagery among groups more apparent. The freedom we had in writing papers allowed me to dive into the topics that I found most compelling, and the in class discussions were always lively and interesting. The in class structure, in which Professor Chang would lecture for part of the time and then we would all discuss together, made the class environment feel very friendly and inspired everyone to engage in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I wished we spent more time in student discussion, but Professor Chang's lectures are very helpful for providing context (especially when most of us in the class are coming from an American/western perspective). ",
            "\u00a0Professor gives excellent writing feedback and delivers interesting lectures ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chang is definitely a strength of this course she is so enthusiastic about the course material, it it wonderful to listen to her lecture about it. The course material was also interesting I just wish there was more instruction or structure for the course material, because I often felt like I just read something, but then just forgot about it. I wish there were more connections between the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well suited to students who are genuinely interested in the material: it is mostly discussion based and not as rigidly structured as some others. A major strength of the course is that it gives space for students to explore nuances of the subjects that are interesting to them. Also, I liked the format whereby each class was split into a lecture and discussion. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class to take if you are interested in reading poetry and learning about Chinese history and women. Professor Chang is extremely nice and approachable, and I think she's a pretty reasonable grader, so this class is pretty low stress. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were particularly specifically interested and would do more things by themselves. The way the course is taught does not match the very interesting content of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone. I went in with no knowledge of Chinese culture or history, having never read or heard of any of the poets we were to read. I ended up learning so much about these women and engaging with some of the most beautiful poetry I'd ever read. I would recommend this to someone of any major;  take this class and do the readings (this is necessary to engage in the discussions and do the papers, but the readings are so wonderful that you'll want to do them). It's not a huge workload with the readings and papers, and Professor Chang is an incredible lecturer who genuinely cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  There are readings every week, and they are all very interesting--relating to female poets, concubines, feminism, foot binding, and more.  There are three essays, but they are not too long and all text-based.  So you learn more about the subjects you've been discussing in class, and don't have to do outside research.  The discussions during class can be pretty wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Chang is a lovely presence in the classroom and so knowledgeable on the subject of women's literature (and so humble considering she pretty much started this field of study!) ",
            "\u00a0anyone interested in traditional China should take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is engaging and not too difficult even if you have no background in literature or poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the intersection of poetry, language, gender studies, and history. These themes are woven together in this course to be easily accessible to those without previous knowledge of Chinese culture. Because this course isn's as rigidly structured as others, I recommend it to students who are genuinely curious in the subject. "
