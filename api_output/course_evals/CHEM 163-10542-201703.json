            "\u00a0This course really fills in some of the gaps from AP Chemistry if you took that in high school. You learn quantum in much greater depth than in high school, get a brief intro to Orgo, and do a little bit with transition metals and solids. The quantum part was actually very interesting, as you learn much of the rationale behind different chemical phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course, I learned so much about chemistry in a way that I have never learned about before. This course covers topics from quantum mechanics to organic chemistry and solid state chemistry and goes really deep on topics and connects them together for us to see the big picture about how chemistry is really a central science that is connected to all sorts of different topics. It also allows us to think conceptually about different topics and link them together in a really satisfying and eye opening way. ",

            "\u00a0I gained knowledge on very fascinating topics such as quantum mechanics, transition metals, and organic chemistry. I also developed the skill of thinking critically significantly due to this class. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fair course that you can't really complain about or rave about. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into chemistry through a new perspective. Very conceptual class, not quantitative in the least. ",
            "\u00a0True to its name, Chem 163 was truly comprehensive. We covered several topics in chemistry in the semester, and I now understand chemistry at a much deeper level than back when I learned it in high school. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely developed a much stronger ability to face challenge and be okay with not meeting my expectations / not doing particularly well grade-wise but still learning a lot. This course also fostered in me a much stronger interest in science and a much better understanding of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Although the topics were difficult and not extremely comprehensive in regards to chemistry in general, I learned more in this course than any other class I have taken. Professor Mayer is extremely intelligent and clearly loves what he teaches. ",

            "\u00a0Taught me to think about all different aspects of chemistry in interdisciplinary ways, and trained me to think critically about biochemistry using perspectives that don't seem immediately obvious at first. ",
            "\u00a0I first learned how Chemistry is taught differently in college compared to in high school. The lecture style was all new to me and I developed skills to absorb new material through a lecture-styled class. I also learned how to deal with the new, confusing material through asking questions in class, reaching out to the professor privately and to use the resources provided by Yale, such as the TF's or the peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about several different topics in chemistry through our introductions to particle chemistry, organic chemistry, and solid state/ transition metal chemistry. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot of deeper chemistry knowledge that I have only learned the surface-level of in high school. My way of thinking and approaching chemistry was changed in this course, as this course is not about memorization or number crunching, but is more about understanding concepts and seeing how they apply in other areas. ",
            "\u00a0This course threw me head-first into the world of chemical bonding, giving me an understanding of how atoms interact in the contexts of quantum, orgo, and solid-state chemistry. I leave the class with a grasp on introductory chemistry as well as an ability to carve my time and work habits to match the rigor of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper and more complete understanding of various selected topics in chemistry. In particular, I feel much more confident discussing chemical bonding, the basics of organic chemistry, and some materials chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction to science at Yale. The course focused on the conceptual side of chemistry rather than the mathematics, which was very helpful for me to visualize and piece concepts together. ",

            "\u00a0This class greatly improved my critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the lies high school chemistry classes teach us as well as an in depth explanation of how the atomic structure. We did 1/3 of the class on organic chemistry although I don't think I'll be taking that class. The most important skill professor tried to instill in us was problem solving - using the conditions of what you know to apply to new situations, answer more difficult questions - I was not able to develop this skill as much as I would have liked. ",

            "\u00a0Way more in depth analysis of the chemistry concepts I learned in high school  that I just learned as given  learned where concepts come from which was really interesting. Also, lots of real world application was incorporated into the class which I really enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an appreciation for the different fields of chemistry and how, despite their distinct conceptual zones, there is unity in understanding their different descriptions of molecules and matter. I also gained an appreciation for the applications of many different chemical phenomena to modern technology/living. ",
            "\u00a0I strenghtened my understanding of chemistry theories and built foundation for organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I achieved a much deeper understanding of many aspects of chemistry in general. By starting the year with quantum, the professor did an excellent job of teaching his students aspects of organic and inorganic chemistry at a much deeper level than most of them were exposed to before. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt enjoyed the course at the beginning but at the end I liked it very much ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some aspects of quantum mechanics and physics that are relevant to chemistry, about transition metal complexes, different types of bonding (metallic, ionic, covalent), some solid state chemistry, and a lot about molecular orbitals and how we describe them.  We also did a unit that was an introduction to organic chemistry. Prof. Mayer also likes to through in some information about how the chemistry that we're learning connects to current events or current applications that are being researched. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of organic chemistry, quantum mechanics, and transition metal chemistry/solid state chemistry. ",

            "\u00a0This was a conceptually deep course and it forced me to truly think like a scientist as opposed to a glorified memorizer. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class I took this semester, and the best Chemistry class I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned concepts in chemistry that followed logically from my high school preparation in AP Chemistry, including the basics of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solid-state chemistry. I especially learned to think about chemistry more conceptually than mathematically alone. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about chemistry, I also learned how to think more critically about science and chemistry and how to attempt to connect different fields through larger ideas. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. It was very hard work, but it taught me how to really think about chemistry conceptually and forces you to truly understand the material more than I have had to in any other class, but in a wonderful and engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think deeply about problems in chemistry, rather than just memorize strategies for answering specific questions. The class was very effective at showing me connections between topics that neither the book nor online resources could do quite as well. The course samples a broad variety of topics and is true to the \"Comprehensive\" name it is marketed under. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better connect different concepts together since Professor Mayer teaches the course in a circular manner where the beginning of the course will tie to the end. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more in-depth knowledge of quantum mechanics, atomic orbitals and molecular bonding, transition metals and the way they form complexes, and organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0chemistry stuff ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about chemistry from this course. It was very broad in subjects covered but by the end cocepts were more coherent. I learned a lot about the subatomic laws that dictated electron behavior. I also learned new ways of understanding molecular bonds and extended solids. ",
            "\u00a0With regards to the material, I learned the basics of quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and solid state chemistry including band theory. I learned how to make no diagrams and to synthesize organic substances from 10 basic reactions for example. I also learned how to wrestle with material that is tested in a less straightforwardt manner than I previously had been exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I gained knowledge about many topics in chemistry, including quantum chemistry, organic chemistry, and solid state chemistry and close packing of spheres. This course assumes you already know key concepts in AP or college-level chemistry, and James Mayer will just continue to build on that knowledge. This class had a lot of real-world applications that Mayer would introduce in class. This course took some time to get used to, but near the end of the course, I truly enjoyed this class and all the material in it. Given the option between CHEM 163 and CHEM 161, definitely choose CHEM 163. CHEM 163 teaches more interesting material, and it is more enjoyable than CHEM 161 (in my opinion). My roommate took 161 and he regrets not taking 163 (even though he had taken AP chem). Therefore, take CHEM 163 over 161 if you have the right prerequisites. "

            "\u00a0Keep Meyer, he is a great teacher and knows really how to engage a class. Although sporadic, everything makes sense in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was interesting, but also that lecture was often insufficient to cover a lot of the material. If you wanted to start the problem sets ahead of time, you often had to teach yourself the material before it was covered in lecture. Also, having to pay for Sapling (for online problem sets) was something that I found more than a little annoying. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great because it goes really deep and it may seem nonsensical and without reason at first, but as you go on, you slowly see the connections with different parts of the course and once you link those together, the class becomes intensely satisfying and more and more fun. The class is immensely difficult but it definitely becomes worth it if you put in the effort. One weakness about the class is that it is not the most organized so you may feel lost and overwhelmed at times but the good thing is you can always study with your classmates and your peer tutors, professor, and teaching fellows provide multiple layers of support that make the workload manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: there are so many resources available to help students understand the content--the peer tutors were exceptional and dedicated so much time to students, the TAs were also helpful, and all of the problem sets and sample exams were useful as well. Also, Professor Mayer is a great professor and is always open to your questions.\r\nWeakness: some TAs seemed to have different levels of preparation for their sections, and I often felt that my section was not helpful in learning new content ",
            "\u00a0Strengths= teaching staff is extremely engaging and allows students to see connections between topics\r\nWeaknesses= not enough practice questions to prepare for exam ",
            "\u00a0This course is designed to challenge you in thinking about chemistry in a new light. The problem sets and exams are challenging, but they are similar in format and style, so throughout the semester you become more comfortable with the way information is presented and asked. The peer tutors were excellent resources to discuss information from class as well as go over the problem sets in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were a knowledgeable professor and readily accessible TAs and peer tutors. They all went above and beyond to give students all the resources necessary for success.  \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this class were that there was little comprehensive feedback of tests and the lectures were sometimes tangential and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0This is honestly an awful course. It felt as if the topics selected were very difficult considering that it was an entry level course, and the workload (P-sets) was too heavy to even be effective. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are very well thought out and lead you through the thought processes needed to come to conclusions on your own.\r\nOftentimes ran out of time in class to learn everything needed to complete homework and had to learn through the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course of explaining a few topics in depth and challenging our previous chemistry knowledge from high school. The professor, TAs, and PTs, were also willing to help the students unconditionally. ",
            "\u00a0Stregths: the material covered is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: not nearly enough is explained or coverned in the lectures so the brunt of teaching fell on the peer tutors who would hold three-five hour review sessions for the exams to teach us the material. This lead to a lot of the material being introduced pretty late in the game and close to the midterms or final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The peer tutoring system was incredible. While I oftentimes found myself lost after attending TF review sessions, the peer tutors were always able to make the material more understandable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It taught me how to think and I feel like I actually understood things rather than just memorized facts. The TAs and peer tutors were also amazing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It could be a better organized (ex. errors in answer keys) ",
            "\u00a0You have to be ready to put a great deal of work in to do well. The peer tutors were incredible and without them, I do not think I could have gotten through this course. ",
            "\u00a0I love that the exams were not simply a copy-paste of problem sets and lecture figures. They really forced me to think outside the box and apply what I learned to new topics, which was very enjoyable, and entirely different from my high school chemistry class. I liked the quirky problem sets for the same reason: they made me think and learn.\r\nThe review session hosted by Prof Mayer, the TA's and peer tutors were very helpful for exam review. The Saplings were not difficult, but were really helpful in gaining an understanding of the material.\r\nFinally, the topics that Prof. Mayer chose to teach were very interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are informative and train the student to filter information and take useful notes on the right content. Lots of material support (lecture figures, practice midterms, problem set answer keys). Could have had a practice final exam for extra review. But, peer tutors and TFs set up lots of review sessions and office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Chem 163 was a very conceptual course, which took a while to get used to, but by the end of the semester I really liked it. Despite being considered an intro course, it covers topics that the majority of the class had never seen before and makes interesting connections between these new topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- many valuable resources are made available to students (professor, teaching fellows, amazing peer tutors), a lot of practice material is made available to students (problem sets, practice exams, online practice quizzes)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- a lot of material is covered in a short amount of time, so keeping up can be a challenge at times ",
            "\u00a0The homework takes forever to do and the TA's only grade two of the questions. You'll find that most of your time is consumed by this class. The class could be a bit more organized. I never know what we are expected to know. There was no practice final exam, which was pretty scary. ",
            "\u00a0The material presented in this class was very interesting. Professor Mayer is very passionate about chemistry, which is inspiring to see. The peer tutors are absolutely incredible, and they do a great job solidifying concepts. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, it was difficult knowing what we have to know for assessments and in what detail, but eventually you get the hang of it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in the peer tutor program and the structure of the material. The peer tutors were definitely the most helpful teachers of the material, and their tireless efforts in guiding us through the class are so appreciated. Secondly, the class builds on itself in such a way that, by the time the final is approaching, students feel prepared and know what will show up on the exam.\r\nAt the same time, the course is not perfect. The lectures are hard to follow and I often left the classroom feeling more confused about the material than when I went in. Additionally, the coursework is heavy, and some problems on the PSets feel a bit like busywork. Finally, the TF sections seem sort of unnecessary, given how much more helpful peer tutors are to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is one which has been very thoughtfully and meticulously constructed and which builds upon itself very well. I could see it being improved by maybe making the units less discrete, without such large changes in course content after each midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material, teacher, psets, peer tutors, review sessions\r\nhard class, but given the resources to do well ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of work. The problem sets are long, Sapling is annoying. Mayer is great in lecture, but sometimes its pretty easy to get lost. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are very useful in building the basic knowledge then developing new ideas and conclusions. I would have to say though, the final  exam should be worth less percentage of the total grade. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the course could have been more organized, with regards to problem sets and midterm preparation. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Mayer's lectures and found the course to be very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class was the many resources that helped us succeed, particularly the peer tutors. The main weakness of the class were that the lectures were a bit difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Professor was sometimes disorganized and he was sometimes behind where information was not taught that was needed on the pset. Overall, he made chemistry really interesting and challenged me a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very poorly organized and taught. I learned a very minimal from the lectures, and the material seemed scattered and not related. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in the passion and goals of its instructor, and in the level of detail/understanding it required. One weakness of the course was that it began with a very conceptually foreign unit (quantum mechanics) which was intimidating to start out with. However, I understand how this order was necessary for the conceptual progression of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: connection to the real world and prof. Mayer's passion for the topic and his students.\r\nWeaknesses: organization ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good challenge in learning how to think and not just memorize information. However, it is poorly organized so it required much learning out of the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0This course was quite challenging and I think they offered ample office hours. The peer tutors were also an added resource that was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could be a little bit more engaging, but the course was really good ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the amazing resources with the peer tutors. They were SO much more helpful than Prof Mayer himself during lecture, and honestly walked us through all of the PSETS. The weakness, I would have to say, is Prof Mayer during lecture. He is very disorganized, and ultimately quite hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0At first I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this class, but it definitely grew on me and I ended up really liking it. Prof. Mayer does a really good job of asking questions on the problem sets challenge you in a good way, and he always wants to remind you how the things that you're learning about relevant to the real world.\r\n \r\nDoing the weekly problem sets can be difficult, but I thought that they helped ground us and they definitely help you to see which parts of the course Prof. Mayer thinks are the most important and what is most likely to come up on the exams. Some of the questions could feel strange at first, but once we got deeper into the unit I could understand why Prof. Mayer would ask them. \r\n\r\nI liked that this course offering a sampling of several different topics in chemistry, and I thought the organic unit was pretty interesting. It was also kind of cool to talk about the quantum mechanics that relates to chemistry. It definitely felt like Prof. Mayer taught what he was most interested in, so I don't think that there was a standard curriculum for intro chemistry at Yale that he was following. That being said, I think that the other chemistry professors here know what he covers in this course.\r\n\r\nAnother positive thing about the class is that there were a lot of resources available to us. We had three peer tutors and they were all wonderful and very dedicated. Their office hours helped me understand the material much more thoroughly than just going to the lectures, and I think this was the case for a lot of my classmates, too. The peer tutors even offered to meet with us individually or in small groups over fall break, which was really generous of them. In addition to their office hours, the TFs and Prof. Mayer also had office hours, and usually Prof. Mayer, the peer tutors, and one of the TFs would each run review sessions before the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course presented interesting material, but it was difficult to study for exams. The problem sets usually required students to go beyond what was taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps it could be more structured. I found it difficult to determine exactly what I should study and what sort of questions I should be preparing to answer when I was preparing for the exams. The focus of the course content is not always exactly clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by having the homework line up more closely with the lessons in the first third of the course. It was not easy trying to learn quantum from the text book and do homework on it before the topics were covered in class, and I don't think my understanding was ultimately any greater for it. However, I loved everything else. I liked the topics that were covered, and I did not find them too difficult to grasp. Challenging, but not so much that I felt lost or like I couldn't catch up. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Mayer linked many different topics within chemistry and physics. Every single lecture was interesting and engaging, and the content was not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the basis of this course on concepts and ideas rather than only mathematics was a major strength as it was a new method of learning chemistry for me. Many resources and support options were available to us if we had questions. My only suggestion would be to have a more clear description of what the class is from the very beginning - \"Comprehensive University Chemistry\" is not the best name for the class. Rather, descriptions should emphasize the three main units of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that it was three times a week and 50min, it was easier to stay engaged. I also liked that we tried to connect things and look at larger concepts. It was definitely too confusing at the beginning, and I wish we'd learned a little less organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a bit unorganized and you really had to go back at the end of a unit and look at all the material as a whole in order to understand it, but the peer tutors were incredibly helpful with this. Also, the material is very interesting and unusual for a freshman chemistry class. ",
            "\u00a0It didnt go over basic concepts- it simply skipped straight into in depth topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in that it taught students an unexpectedly effective method of thinking about chemistry. I liked the fact that this course gave me the ability to solve questions that straddle different subjects. Conversely, I think this course needs to be structured to slowly introduce us to this way of thinking. Looking back, the lectures before midterm one now make sense, but at the time we were not accustomed to the principles and teaching style of this course. This sometimes could leave us in the dark, and I wish we were more carefully introduced to key concepts in the start of the year. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that the course really went beyond just basic chemistry and tied all the concepts together.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that the problem sets tended to have extended questions that did not really help with understanding the material. Perhaps switch out these questions for those that really solidify students' understanding? ",
            "\u00a0at times it is unnecessarily hard. there is literally no incentive to take this course since on paper it is the same exact requirement as general chemistry. I was hoping it would be similar to gen chem but skipping the boring and super basic parts. instead the professor expected us to teach ourselves half the material and gave a huge amount of work every week which as a student athlete was literally impossible to complete. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty fast paced and lectures can sometimes be quite confusing, but overall I loved this class. The weakness of the course is that sometimes Mayer gets behind in lecture and doing the homework can be a bit confusing. But you shouldn't worry to much. There is a ton of extra help and resources available. Our peer tutors this year were AMAZING and I learned a lot from them when the lectures weren't crystal clear. In my opinion, the biggest strength of this class is that Mayer makes sure that you see the real-world connections of everything you learn. This made the course so much more interesting than your average gen chem class (i.e. CHEM 161). For example, when we learned about orgo, we also learned about how organic molecules are structured and utilized in the body. During the solid state unit, we learned how defects in lattices are used to make pv solar cells. It was not an easy class at all, but if you put in the work necessary (which is quite a bit) and get help when you need it, the class is really rewarding and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is generally well-run. The TA's are great. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very intriguing and there were several moments in which I was utterly surprised by the material. Towards the end of the semester I felt as if everything pieces together very well. At points the topics seemed unrelated which made them confusing but after the fact everything was more clear. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the lectures are engaging and you learn a lot of material that you have never been exposed to before but the lectures at times can go in very nonlinear, tangent directions which can cause a lot of confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths in this course are that you learn a lot of chemistry in only one semester. The way the course is organized is actually genius, since Mayer first starts with the smallest particles (electrons) and works his way up through the semester to molecules and eventually infinite extended solids. One weakness that this course has is that Mayer jumps right into the material, which may throw some students off (like me) and think the class is terrible, when in reality, the class is one of the best taught at Yale (at least in your first semester). Given the option between CHEM 163 and CHEM 161, definitely choose CHEM 163. Another weakness in the course is Mayer's eyesight: he seems to never see a student's hand, and therefore you have to call out that you have a question. Also, Mayer will seem arrogant at times, but that is probably because he doesn't realize that his students are not as educated as he is. Also, if you do not understand something, do not hesitate to go to the TF's or peer tutors: they will explain MUCH BETTER than Mayer will. "

            "\u00a0Look, if you want an easy A or are just looking to fulfill a chem requirement, go take 161/Normal Gen Chem. If you actually interested in building upon prior Chem knowledge a bit and learning some interesting things, then this is definitely a fascinating class. I will say, however, that it can be a lot of work, and that having to pay for the online problem set website is a pain. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are willing to take on a challenging but rewarding course. This is definitely a class that you have to put in work and go to review sessions and peer tutor hours but as the class goes on, you will understand more and more of how the class works and it really gives you a comprehensive view of chemistry and most of the things you learn are things you that would not have learned in high school, keeping classes interesting and intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0YES. I was warned against this class because people said it was very challenging and not well-organized. Although I definitely thought this was probably my most challenging class this semester, it was definitely rewarding to learn so much chemistry in a new perspective. It can be hard at first to understand why Professor Mayer asked a question a certain way or structured the course this way, but at the end, all of the pieces came together so well. I felt very engaged in this class and pushed/stretched to think differently. Definitely would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student because the class explains many topics that were not expanded upon in high school chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Although I initially was hesitant to take this course, I am very grateful that I did. It was challenging, interesting, exciting, and new. It did not feel like my high school AP chemistry class, it was different in the best way possible. The lectures were interesting and sometimes interactive, the discussion sections were useful, and the peer tutors were incredibly helpful ways to grasp the challenging concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because although it started off seeming daunting, Professor Mayer's methods became clear towards the middle and I realized that I understood a lot more than I had originally thought. This is a very interesting chemistry class, perfect as a follow up to AP chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. It is truly a waste of time, since any student would learn a lot more in Chem 161 and actually be able to understand the concepts that were being taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student since it provides them with information that challenges their previous knowledge. This course also encourages them to think critically about how electrons, atoms, molecules, and even solids interact with one another and relate to the world that we live in. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. You learn a lot and it's not too hard. ",
            "\u00a0Theres no reason to take this class. It is very difficult. Take 161 instead. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have already recommended taking this class to several of my peers. This class is critical in the journey to truly understanding chemistry beyond the superficial, analytical learning method that is taught to high school students in AP Chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0It depends - I really enjoyed it and it is exactly what I want out of a Yale education, but it was a lot of work. I would recommend it for people who want to study science, but not to humanities majors who want a low-work, relaxed science credit. ",

            "\u00a0It's hard to say whether I would recommend Chem 163 to other students. On the one hand, the material is very interesting and engaging, but on the other hand, it is a challenging course that provides little benefit over freshman organic chemistry or the easier Chem 161. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a challenge, but in the end, worth it. I am very happy with my choice to take this over Bio or 161. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course gives a good overview of chemistry and can be a good indication as to whether or not a student wants to continue education within the department. It was a decent workload, but totally worth it. I also really appreciated the effort that Professor Mayer put in to tie the class content to the modern-day world and news stories. ",
            "\u00a0Very fun. I love this class because it connects so many topics in new ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It took a while to get used to the format and the types of questions that were asked, but if you stick with it it's very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this class to students who believe that their knowledge is past the levels of AP Chemistry, but still wish to engage in materials that delve deeper into the fields of the subjects taught in AP Chemistry. This course also may be a good preparation for students who wish to take Organic Chemistry in the upcoming semesters. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is certainly the most challenging course I took during my first semester, but it was rewarding and I am glad I stuck with it. Early on, it may seem as though the course is unorganized and disjointed, but by the end of the course everything Professor Mayer brings things full circle and you are able to see how it all fit into the bigger picture. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really hard, and if you're looking for an easy and more organized pre-med chemistry class, take 161 or 174. There is absolutely no math involved in this course, and it is purely conceptual, which some people may like, but the professor is all over the place. At first, you may feel totally lost, but you eventually get the hang of the subject material and his tests. However, I do not want to shy anybody away from this course because once the material clicks, it's like you have suddenly joined the church of STEM. I really didn't like this class at the time, but I think it is very rewarding. Honestly, the only useful thing, as in the only part of this class that I will use in the future, was the organic chemistry part. If you did place into 161, it is a piece of cake and a review of AP chemistry. Had I known about Freshman Orgo I would have skipped 163 and done that. I do feel like I have a head start on the peasants in 161 for organic chemistry next year. Also, the teaching fellows tell you that memorization will not help you. This is a lie. Go grab the whole ream of paper from the printer, and start rewriting all psets, lecture figures, and practice exams boo boo. Write and rewrite girl like theres no tomorrow! Also make sure you pay attention to the diagrams and material he puts on the lecture figures because they often appear on the tests! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is truly interested in chemistry or learning more about chemistry principles, and someone who is ready for the rigor of this course. It was definitely a challenging course, but I personally feel more prepared for future science courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would emphasize that the course is a large undertaking, so the student must think carefully about where it would fit best in their schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student if they were really interested in the material and were willing to put in a significant amount of work. It is a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it if you have an interest in the material. ",

This was the class that I spent the most time on this semester, since I often went to peer tutoring and worked in groups on the problem sets, but I thought that the course challenged me in a good way. Sometimes it could start to feel a little overwhelming, but even though it was a large lecture course, I felt like there was a sense of community in my class and we collaborated a lot to help each other out. Working with my classmates and the peer tutors helped me to keep it under control, so I never felt like I was completely out of my depth, even though the class was tough. I took this class because I'm interested in pursuing a STEM major and I know a lot of them require chemistry, but now I think I like chemistry more than when I started the course. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. This class will certainly be more challenging than Chem 161, but I think this course will prove far more helpful in the long term. This class will help you think much differently that you might be accustomed to, and it will give the framework to solve al sorts of chemistry problems, including ones you haven't seen before. ",
            "\u00a0No. Do not take this course. There is no point. It is the exact same requirement as general chemistry but will be unnecessarily hard and with much higher expectations and workload. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I honestly did not like chemistry at all in high school, but this class has made me consider taking maybe even majoring in chem?! I feel like a have so much more chemistry knowledge than I did a semester ago and a better understanding of the world at large. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to really understand and engage with the concepts, this course will teach you a lot. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It took awhile to warm up to it, but if you already have a basic knowledge of Chemistry, it's worth it. The TA's are great. The course is very theoretical, so don't be expecting an easy A. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student if that student likes chemistry. I would VERY HIGHLY recommend this course over CHEM 161 (if you have the required prerequisites), since CHEM 163 will be a better use of your time. This course is very interesting, and it will require hard work to understand the material, but it will change how you think about chemistry (which I promise is a good thing in the end). Given the option between CHEM 163 and CHEM 161, definitely choose CHEM 163. CHEM 163 teaches more interesting material, and it is more enjoyable than CHEM 161 (in my opinion). My roommate took 161 and he regrets not taking 163 (even though he had taken AP chem). Therefore, take CHEM 163 over 161 if you have the right prerequisites. This course is a very interesting course, and I hope you take it. And honestly, the TF's are great: I did not understand what hybridization was before this class (which is important to know I now realize), and there were many resources for me to go to to understand fundamental concepts in chemistry that would be the foundation upon which Mayer will build.
