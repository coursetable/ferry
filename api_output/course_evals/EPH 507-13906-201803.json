Good that participation is through the takeaways, as more reserved students can still contribute.\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of complex material that definitely merits more time--also, though theory is good, I think it is best supplemented with specific case studies or discussion of current issues because otherwise seems a bit repetitive over time. Perhaps a shorter lecture and longer discussion sections could be helpful, since discussion was a space that was a lot more engaging, material wise. ",
            "\u00a0The pace at this course went made it difficult to learn because it was not clear what we were learning in class. The discussion being a week after the class makes it hard to remember what we talked about. This class should not be taught to so many people all at once. I would just make the class once a week, one hour lecture, one hour discussion, back to back. ",

            "\u00a0I think it is a good course to cover the general background of social justice and health equity issues. I think the discussion sections were a strength (although they seemed quite short) because they gave us the opportunity to really engage with the material. A definite weakness was the size of the class. I feel it would have been much more productive in smaller groups. ",
            "\u00a0A clear strength of the course was the comprehensive material that included many different sub-disciplines. However, a weakness was the format of the course. Having the same lecturer, lecture for an hour and 50 minutes each week became monotonous. I feel like the class would have been more engaging if guest lecturers who were experts in their field came and spoke to our class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Great overall introduction to public health issues as well as practical implications and real-world examples. The opportunity to write an op-ed was wonderful\r\nWeaknesses- Little opportunity to apply the material-- would have been helpful to have a couple more assignments (maybe where we could build our intervention, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: making class/discussion section mandatory ",
            "\u00a0The course materials and contents are strengths. Lectures should be more concise. Harkness Auditorium is too big and there are too many students in this course to have meaningful discussions during lecture. Instead of trying to engage students in lectures,  discussion sessions led by TFs should be lengthened so that students can discuss regarding lecture materials in a small group. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0Need to cater better to big classroom. Boring at times. Split this class with ethics. ",
            "\u00a0I was not a huge fan of this course. The length of the lecture on Tuesday was not ideal, and having a discussion a week later was not confusing. I did enjoy discussion, I feel I got more out of it. I think that this class might be better served as mainly small group discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 60% of the assignments were diverse and reflected different learning styles.  I highly recommend this course.  As an EMD student, his course is incredibly accessible to those who do not have a strong sociology or psychology background.  Like any class, what you put in is what you get out. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One 5-10 page take home final exam worth 40%.  This was difficult to achieve in one week while also studying for 4 other exams as the content asked on the final was incredibly comprehensive and time-consuming.  The questions were fairly asked, but if you want to write a quality paper and answer the questions to the best of your knowledge to reflect accurately what you learned, it was just a short amount of time, as it took double the time to write as the time I took to study for other exams. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the structure of this course should change in the future, or it should be reduced to a shorter, not full-credit course. Due to the size of the class there is little time to delve into the actual subject of social justice in any meaningful way; instead, we spent most of our time talking about theory rather than actual application. This course would benefit from being redesigned to more closely look like how our Ethics course looked this semester-- we either should dedicate less, but more intense time or the course should be more focused on case studies of actual social justice issues rather than a vast smattering of topics that we have to move too quickly through. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the projects and assignments given to us, the Ted talk was a great way to learn and it was a fun way to start the discussion. I wish the course was in a smaller lecture hall but nonetheless, the topics were still interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think that the course should of been 1.5 hours for lecture and 1.5 hours for the discussions. There also should have been guest speakers who maybe worked specifically with the material we were learning. Trace was great but it was hard to listen to him speak for 2 hours every week. I would have loved to hear outsides speakers and understand how we can research and understand social justice in the real world. I also felt like I learned more about applications through the discussion section but never had enough time to dive into deep conversations. Also, we shouldn't discussion almost a week after we discussed the material in class. We should have the lecture on Monday and the discussion on Tuesday. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly believe that all students and aspiring professionals should be exposed to the content focused on in this course. Its weaknesses included that some of the lectures got tedious at times, the videos and other teaching strategies helped to alleviate this, though. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course. I thought I knew about social justice just from being a woke millenial, but there is so much I didn't know or ever think about. The discussion section were especially helpful because they created a safe space to talk about sensitive topics. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting topics, could be more structured ",
            "\u00a0It introduces many different aspects of the interactions  between social justice and public health. I love this course.\r\nBut maybe the topics are  a little vague and general. ",
            "\u00a0Bad format, needs to be a half credit (share the semester with Ethics!!  Please!!).  I feel like I had the gist of this class after week 2, and didnt really need to go to class.  Theories are great, but we should have been incorporating real world case studies more.  Discussion sections were widely varied, and werent that relevant to course material, kinda all over the place.  Good, argumentative discussions werent had, and I know people have varied opinions in these topics!  This class didnt need to be boring.\r\n\r\nMake this class a half credit!  First years have a million requirements, this didnt need to be a whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0There were too many students for the structure of this course ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in thinking about social justice issues in health and in everyday life. This is one of the few courses that has impacted by day-to-day thinking. The course was informative and important for studying public health through a social justice lens.\r\nIncreasing the discussion section time and possibly reducing lecture time would be useful for a course like this. These issues require learning from different people's experiences, and discussion gives an opportunity for students to share these experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good. not a subject I am as interested in so don't have any strong opinions ",
            "\u00a0I think the take-away question took away from my experience in this class. I would typically spend the entire lecture period not paying attention to the lecture because I was too busy writing my take-away since more emphasis was placed on the reading in the grading of the take-away than on the actual lecture. Because of this, I feel as if I gained almost nothing from the lectures. The ted talk and the op-ed were great assignments that I enjoyed. The final is a lot more work than I feel like a final should be. I would have rather written 5 individual papers throughout the semester than have one week to write five papers amidst all the other studying I have to do. ",
            "\u00a0The class could have benefitted from having a smaller class size and meeting more than once per week. Other than that, the lectures and readings were interesting and relevant to my interests in public health and I really enjoyed my time as a student in this class. I would strongly recommend it to other students. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0This class was taught well by the instructor. The teaching style was dull and the class time was way too long. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is important and highly relevant for work in public health. One suggestion for the future would be moving discussion so that there is less time in between lecture and discussion. I also think increasing the length of discussion section would be useful. I think that the discussion is a better format to grapple with the very complex, difficult issues that we cover in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good basic introduction to issues of social justice in the public health field, and the topic is critical for future public health practitioners to be aware of. The lectures were too long and felt repetitive and simplistic at times. The section was really good and a good space for facilitated discussions. It's important that this course exists, but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of content and lecture style. ",
            "\u00a0This course was executed extremely poorly. The incredibly long lectures were not very informative and hard to absorb. The end of lecture take away assignments were ridiculous considering how much material was covered in each lecture. To meaningfully summarize all the information and cite readings at the end of a lecture is absolutely unrealistic. Though a rubric was provided, grades that were assigned to the take away assignments and writing assignments appeared arbitrary and comments were not given for the majority of the grades assigned. This course would be better served as a seminar type class with less pressures of generating a long writing piece at the end of each lecture and focus on the learning of the concepts. So much emphasis was placed on these writing assignments that any value the lectures had were replaced with frantic typing of summary points. ",
            "\u00a0While social justice is very important in the field of public health, I do not understand why every single concept in this course was labeled as racism and discrimination. Many students expressed disagreement with a lot of the content presented and I do not understand why this is a required course for 1st year students. I did not gain much from this course. A lot of the material was common sense and could have been presented to us within 2 hours rather than a whole semester. Additionally, this class is a very liberal class. I do not agree with having students take this if their views do not align, ESPECIALLY since everything in this course tries very hard to pinpoint racism as an issue for every single situation. There was a lot of content presented that I do not agree with. This course was VERY subjective and I did not enjoy it at all. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great survey of social justice and social determinants of health\r\n\r\ncons: the structure of course impeded upon the retention of material. ",
            "\u00a0Not much learned, but no real issues. I dont think this needs to be a full semester course- there just isnt enough material as structured. The discussion section was pretty good but this class does not work at all as a 200 person lecture class.\r\nWould recommend making this half a semester and making bioethics required and graded for  half a semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great intro to health justice concepts and learning about the frameworks to think about exploring these topics. As an SBS student, I wish it was more in-depth or that the discussion sections were longer to facilitate further critical thinking. Overall it was a good course and a great opportunity to think about equitable ways to improve health outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0Kind of messy. We bounced through a lot of topics and it's hard to engage in a large lecture, especially when only 5 students participate. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is inherently interesting to me because it is about social issues, which I have always enjoyed learning about. However, how this course was taught made me strongly dislike learning about this material, which was very disappointing. The course could have incorporated things like popular culture and current events but instead it was presented by showing us strictly textbook definition vocabulary terms and concepts. The entire course is a weakness. The slow grading, the proxies for assessing student understanding of material, how our lecture had too many students and was way too long as well as having too short of discussion section to really discuss the material. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the content and discussion format. The lectures were too long and I would lose focus. I think two shorter lectures per week would be better ",
            "\u00a0Going into this course, I was incredibly excited. The syllabus sounded engaging, and the material we were going to cover is incredibly important to public health work. However, I was sorely disappointed. Lectures were dry and wholly unengaging. I felt no investment in the subjects that I wholly believe every public health practitioner needs to learn about. Assignments did not assist in my learning. I think the entire course needs to be restructured such that students actually engage in the material. One way to do so would be to make it a small, non-lecture course. At the very least, the lectures should be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the course was divided into weekly themes. Readings could have been better integrated into lectures/discussions. The workload outside of readings was very manageable and feedback was timely. I also enjoyed the post-lecture takeaways as a way to synthesize and reflect on the day's content. \r\n\r\nI do feel that this course is better suited for a small discussion-based class, given the nature of the material, but I guess that is what the sections were for. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the course that made me somewhat uncomfortable is that the Ted Talk (a large percent of the grade) was graded by TFs. I know that not all TFs graded the same, and I felt uneasy knowing that so much of my grade in the course was left to students only a year older than me. Of course, it wouldn't be possible for Trace to grade all of the Ted Talks, but perhaps there could be more standardization in how the Ted Talks are graded. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good attempt in shifting the curriculum toward a more social justice focus but emphasized more theories than action. Even though theories are vital to understanding and implementing effective programs, I felt helpless most of the time. I was hoping this class would have me engage more intentionally and in the community. Adding a community focus like a group project as a final project instead of final essays might be more fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was very poorly taught. The lectures were not engaging, which is surprising given how many of us went into public health to tackle issues of social inequity. Also making lectures and section mandatory did not help; it made the class seem like simply a requirement we had to take rather than one we were actually interested in. ",
            "\u00a0This course touched on a lot of important concepts that are relevant to public health and conducting research in public health. I enjoyed all the assignments such as the Ted talk and Op-ed that were done throughout the semester. However, I found the weekly discussions to be more helpful and conducive to learning than the weekly lectures. I would recommend that the discussions be made longer each week and incorporate lecture material into the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course are that it categorizes social justice effectively into major learning blocks - structural determinants of health, economic determinants of health, built and non-built environment, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe major weakness is that it is too fixated on research.  I understand that Yale University is a predominantly research university but there are already a plethora of courses, labs, and resources for students who want to explore social epidemiology.  We don't need another research course at YSPH.  It would be great if the course stayed predominantly fixated on implementation/grassroots work.  Maybe it can be paired with the practicum class and converted into a year-long sequence so that students gain hands on experience in a structure format. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this class definitely has a lot of potential. It touches on very important topics pertaining to health equity and social justice. Discussions were super fun and a great space for students to feel more comfortable discussing the topics vs a larger size lecture hall. Readings are super interesting and some TED talks/videos were very touching. I enjoyed the weekly readings a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) lectures were long and dry sometimes. I think having a 2 hours of lecture straight without a break in-between can be tiring. 2) I also think the set up of the class is quite off  and I didnt like that assignments prompted us to express our opinions. Im not saying it is not important, but I think there is a level of privilege associated with ones ability to express their opinions in a platform. Some people do not like to express their opinions because of their socioeconomic position or legal position. Personally, I didnt feel comfortable writing the op-ed and I expected to get not a superb grade. I find the assignment to be borderline censoring. I thought the assignment could include another option other than the op-ed would be better so that students didnt feel like they were being graded on their opinions or how well they should express their opinions. Some people like to keep things to themselves, but that doesnt mean they are any less woke or informed. 3) Going off of that, a lot of students are not from the US - a lot came to the US for the first time. So, telling them to express their opinions about US social issues that are related directly to politics is too much to ask. Without much exposure to US cultures and politics, this was a hard task for these studentsSo, in a way, this class was not very equitable to these students. 4) I thought the final could be timed better. Writing 5 essays in a span of 7 days without prior knowledge of what to expect (i.e. there was no rubric or sample A grade response). For big assignments like that, students should have about a month in advance to prepare. Squeezing a 10 page double space paper in one week was a bit too much. I spent so much time on the final that I didnt have a lot of time to study for other finals. 5) I think having guest lecturers who are from the community would be a more refreshing approach.  I think inviting community members who do the work on the ground would be a good way to connect students from an elite institution such Yale with the community more, so that we dont run the risk of isolating ourselves with the community and just doing all the talking. We could talk about theoretical frameworks on studying social justice all day, but we would be just intellectualizing things that are so obviouswe should also be in touch with the community too. Inviting guest speakers who are from certain communities with vulnerabilities would invite more perspectives and maybe ways for students to contribute more and ways for the instructors to motivate students to show up to lectures.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, good overarching integration of intersectionality, discussion was okay.\r\nWeaknesses: There were a lack of rubrics, theories weren't presented as theories, take-homes were too long, a lot of studies/data was over 10+ old, class is really big for something that feels like it requires more discussion. The readings also don't always have to be reading, some topics are better covered via video or movie. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I was not a fan of this class. I find this topic incredibly informative and important to cover, but do not believe it was an effective use of our students' time. I loved the discussions, but the lectures were too long, the information was not always informative or up to date and it was honestly upsetting that we had takeaways that we had to write at the end of the class we were graded on. It required you to be in class, without excuses, and then our takeaways were graded on its accuracy, though it was supposed to be a quick summary of what we learned in class that day. I would have a much more negative experience of this course if it was not for my wonderful TF and our discussion group. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of potential but utterly failed. I don't think the nuanced discussions and lessons this class was trying to teach was possible in a setting of nearly 200 students. The additional section certainly made up for it. I think many of the older students who come into the program with experience in this field can feel detached, because the course material itself was sort of basic and elementary. I wish we could've had much more deep and poignant discussions about a lot of these topics that matter, but it became more about introducing basic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Kershaw needs to be more open to opposing points of view. A few conservatives felt severely marginalized and discriminated against. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my biggest disappointment of the fall semester. As a SBS/MPH student this course should have been fundamentally fascinating, but while all topics we discussed were important the format of the class greatly hindered its impact. Topics of relating to social justice and health equity need to be discussed in a small group format, simply lecturing at us for 2 hours a week about systemic racism and injustices does nothing. ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is an extremely topic that should be discussed but seem inappropriate in a large lecture style setting. It seemed like it would have been better in a smaller seminar class. There are definitely important social justice topics covered that everyone in public health should take into consideration when preforming their work. ",

            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed my section and was able to learn more through open discussion on the topics presented in class. Having to discuss in a large sized classroom is more intimidating. The content of the course is vital to discuss for any public health professional. ",
            "\u00a0This course took up more time than necessary. A two hour lecture and fifty minute discussion section is an ineffective allocation of time for this course.  If anything, lectures could be shorter and discussions could be longer. The grading of assignments seemed too harsh and specific, especially given that the prompts were fairly open-ended and seemed to allow for creativity. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I felt that I had little guidance on the material I was actually supposed to be learning from the course. I really wish that we would have had at-home weekly questions similar to the final that would have allowed us to actually work with the material rather than simply discussing the material in lectures and discussion.

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Small sections with well-trained TFs who led interesting discussions and provided engaging activities.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI was disappointed with this course and felt that its only function was to meet a CEPH accreditation requirement. More specifically:\r\n-The structure of this class was flawed. It would have been far more productive to swap the length of lecture and section times -- i.e. a 50 minute lecture and ~2 hour section. We were barely able to scratch the surface in sections and often found ourselves generating compelling, creative solutions to public health problems only to be cut off before we could truly solidify our ideas. \r\n-Inconsistency and lack of clarity with grading rubrics, especially with the op-ed assignment.\r\n-The final exam: our understanding throughout the semester was that if we kept up with readings and attended lectures, we would be able to reference and pull from material we learned to complete this final. This was not the case, and while I'm loath to criticize in this way (i.e. volume of work), the expectation of workload for this final was unreasonable and poorly structured. Writing one final research paper (which still could have been chosen from the prompts we were provided), rather than five short essays, would have been a better option. The questions we were asked were frankly too dense to adequately address in the required space limitations, and I would have preferred the opportunity to dive deeply into one question instead of superficially into many. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, important information for effective public health work\r\nWeaknesses: section could have been longer as I felt more learning took place during section, compared to lecture (and lecture often felt too long and repetitive at times). Trace is a great person but lectures by him are not always the most engaging (especially as the lectures are 2 hours long...). A lot of the information regarding health equity and social justice felt repetitive across lectures and within a lecture (although the point may be very important, it feels like the same point over and over again). ",
            "\u00a0I think this course made a lot of assumptions about the class, and never addressed those assumptions. YSPH MPH students are predominantly white, and the course was clearly structured to teach to white people. It is tedious to be brown and female and sit through study after study demonstrating the relevance of intersectionality. I know. I live it. I do appreciate that my white peers are listening and learning. But I would like there to be some acknowledgement in the future that the class itself reflects inequity in the education system, and that there's a reason the course content is structured the way it is. I did really like the discussion sections, because they gave people an opportunity to debate and defend ideas. That was enjoyable, and a space for me to hone my own opinions. ",
            "\u00a0This class, I feel, was a waste of time. I learned concepts that were problems that I already understood were problems, but we never really had discussions on solutions or what we can do better. It was all here's a problem, and this is why it's a problem, and there are some things you can do in a study to account for them, but never talking about solutions or things we can do better as public health professionals. I also don't think this was a good environment. I think people were often to speak their opinions or feelings because they were afraid of being judged or criticized for not being PC enough. Everything was ideal theoretically, but there was too much sensitivity and hand holding to have real conversations. I think this class could have been done in two or three lectures. I did not get anything out of it except a fear to speak to my peers about my opinions on topics because I wasn't liberal enough. ",

This class could be improved if it was a smaller class for the majority of the time - I think switching the time blocks of the discussion and lecture would help make this class even better. All in all, this was a great class on  material that can be difficult to cover. ",

However, I don't think the lecture was conducive to discussing these big topics and the instructor tried to make lecture a big discussion, which was not successful. I think the course would have been better if we spent more time in our classroom discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topic choice overall\r\nWeakness: very shallow approach to very complex subject. Not meant to be a large lecture. TF's did not have exceptional knowledge. I would suggest TF's with more profound critical race theory knowledge or activist experience ",
            "\u00a0I was really disappointed in this class - I think it could have offered so much more. I know Social Justice and Health Equity is a broad topic but I think the class was very poorly designed. The readings and lectures seemed rather disjointed - very dense although interesting readings that did not connect to class lecture or section. However, I did like the pairing of academic readings plus pop culture/contemporary readings - and the mixed media was a great way to break up the readings.\r\nThe sections with my TF were the best part of the class - in my opinion, the class lecture time and section time should be flipped. In other words, we should be spending more time in small groups as we discuss these big topics. Issues of social justice and health equity are not easily taught in large settings. In fact, I think the large setting was a detriment to class participation, engagement, and general understanding. Issues of justice/intersectionality/equity are incredibly important and interesting, but the large lecture setting put a damper on everything. ",

            "\u00a0The course has tremendous potential but really fell short. Strengths: opportunity to get everyone on the same page with regards to the basics of social determinants and health justice oriented frameworks. Weaknesses: lecturer does not compel minority students based on his race, gender, sexuality, etc. Hearing the same content from a POC or other minority in any snare would have made for a more comfortable and productive learning environment. Cases often felt abstract to the point where some students lacked empathy and genuine concern for populations examined. Grouping students in discussion sections by social justice areas of interest could lead to deeper/richer discussions. Having more colored/minority TFs is key. ",
            "\u00a0Sigh...I wish this class were better than it was. \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n+ Covers information that public health students need to know! Mandatory discussion section was annoying but essential for learning the information\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Going to class felt like a waste of time. Since many of the topics discussed in one class sitting could be taught as an entire course itself, information covered in class was very surface level, so students who had any amount of previous exposure to this information were left wanting more. \r\n- The studies used in class to supplement the main discussion were often poorly described and did not seem to properly flow with what Trace was trying to communicate. Often times the conclusion seemed like a major stretch from what we were discussing in class.\r\n- Trace could have been a better professor. I understand that he cares about this material, but the way he presented himself and the information in class gave off a vibe that he didn't. ",

            "\u00a0Very interesting course. Thought provoking. I liked the themes that Trace described throughout. The TED talk was a highlight of br course. Nerve-wracking! Instructive and helpful though with integrating material and teaching how to present in front of others. ",
            "\u00a0I think the takeaways were well intentioned but they caused me to be distracted in class because I was worried about getting full credit on them. I think they sort of well self defeating in that sense. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was okay: I wish that we talked a little more in depth on certain topics. I think the class was great in that it touched upon the wide breadth of topics that encompasses social justice but I think that by how the class was structured (1 2-hr class a week), it almost seemed like some topics were just thrown together while some may have not been talked about enough (e.g. it would have been nice to have touched on why we see health disparities in the American Indian/Alaskan native population and the health inequities within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community). I think the class would be better if we had less in-class breakout sessions and just more time to discuss the material. I also would have liked to talk a little more about the readings during class and how those papers changed perspectives or whether some of the thoughts in those papers are disputed. Although discussion was designed to talk about the papers in depth, I feel like that also was not possible since discussion is only an hour. I think the class did help me think critically about a lot of the topics we discussed but it also could have been more hands-on. I think that the ted talk was really nice and the final was good but I wish the final was a midterm and we could have had an additional final project where we were given case studies and had to analyze how to go about developing a public health measure that is socially just and requires the knowledge that we gained from this class. This class was pretty good as a starter at discussing social justice but I think class time could have been utilized better or changing the schedule to help make the class seem less disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0I very much liked the discussion sections: we were able to think critically and come up with interesting discussion topics.\r\nThe Social justice topic however, does not seem to be suited for 200 person lecture halls. Slides can become very vague and conceptual, and it is difficult to motivate and keep students interested within the context of an auditorium.\r\nMaybe to reformulate the structure of the course... ",
            "\u00a0The course tells us the definition of social justice and what aspects it covers, but I do not understand why all MPH students are required to have this lesson. It would be better if we could just have this course like health ethics, several lectures and group discussion would more beneficial and effective. ",
            "\u00a0There should be no take-home finals, and not be over 10-15 pages types long during finals week, especially when its released just during finals week.  It felt more like a term paper to be honest and I think it caused a lot of stress and not the best of student's abilities because of this. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty basic summary course. The grading of the lecture take-aways seemed pretty arbitrary (I put in so much effort into these- I cited 1-2 readings in each one to try to get full credit, but for some reason, I got points taken off, and there wasn't much feedback from the professor on why these points were taken off). But overall, it was a fine course. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this course was well curated. All the readings were interesting and supplemented the lectures very well. The lectures were engaging and relevant to topics currently being discussed around the country, which made them even more engaging. I wish we went deeper into the concepts we were learning. The course seems like an introduction to social justice topics. I also don't think the lecture takeaways were helpful. I don't think they should be part of our grade. ",
            "\u00a0The component that dealt with actual health outcomes and the history leading to inequities was great but there was too much focus on deconstructing identity and intersectionality. The sections were helpful but also sometimes drifted into discussions that had nothing to do with health. ",
            "\u00a0If this course will continue to be taught by a white man, I would like to see it be co-taught with a woman of color. I felt the lectures themselves were too long and would have instead like to see the course run from 3:00-4:20 and the extra 30 minutes be added to our weekly discussion groups. If the course cannot feasibly be co-taught it would have been worthwhile to bring in speakers of diverse backgrounds and abilities to discuss topics we were learning. It would have been beneficial to have the teaching fellows hold students more accountable because many never read at all and that made it difficult to have fruitful discussions. There also seemed to be gaps between the capacity for dynamic facilitation of the topics across the teaching fellows. ",
            "\u00a0Really fantastic addition and extremely important for public health practitioners. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and the environment which Trace created. I would suggest that some content on disability rights be added as it is very important social issues that was not covered directly by the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the intent and content of this course, and am very glad it's being taught as a required class at YSPH. However, it felt very basic and introductory, and covered material that I hope most MPH students would have at least a basic understanding of before beginning a graduate degree. It seemed that there was room to go farther into each of the topics addressed by asking harder questions, diving into more challenging discussion topics and pushing students beyond developing a basic social justice terminology and into building an actively antioppressive framework for their future public health work.\r\nThe structure of the course - large lecture followed by discussions facilitated by second year MPH students who were teaching for the first time - was also not conducive to asking hard questions, thinking critically, and getting into material in a deep and meaningful way. The Ted talks tended to take up most of the discussion section, so we did not get to discuss much of the course material except superficially. In order to do justice to this material and make students engage meaningfully with it, I think the discussion section needs to be more than 50 minutes per week, and to be facilitated by someone with more experience than a second year. This should not reflect on the TA for my section - it was something I heard stated by students across multiple sections, even though they liked their individual TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was not a very beneficial class  especially for a introductory class. It lacked depth and the course material was very mundane and not taught in an interactive way. I find the material of social justice and health equity quite interesting but this class lacked depth. In addition, the take home final for this class was way too long and became more of burden than a practical way to test what we learned throughout the semester. ",

The discussion section was the most impactful as it allowed my classmates and I to discuss public health and societal issues together and see different perspectives on the same topics. \r\nWeaknesses - not overly engaging and not very public health solution based ",

            "\u00a0This is a brand new field for me. Without background cultural knowledge, I spent significant time on the subject. The class relied much on cases and reading material. As for me, those cases could be showed in a a more interesting way. The study designs could be explained more specifically. ",

As well, it is a great way to examine how history and structural changes influence health of people today.

This class could be improved by having a midterm similar to the final. I think that it would be beneficial to split the final workload between two essays.

I had never before had a class where I really felt that there were certain questions I couldn't ask or points I couldn't make. The class itself was quite radically to the left, and it shouldn't be assumed that we are all approaching these issues from that direction. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an extremely poor way to learn social justice and health equity.  The data presented was often wrong and the studies were merely glimpsed over instead of taught in depth in the way they should have been.  The projects assigned - the TED talk, Op-Ed, take-aways, and final were incredibly time consuming and the grading requirements were subjective and unclear.  The social justice and health equity requirement could've been met by having students choose a class they wanted to take that had a social justice component.  If this class is to be repeated, provide the TFs with clear guidelines as to what they should teach, get rid of the TED talk (it's bogus, time consuming, tries to bridge together 3 incredibly vague and disconnected topics, and often the work burden falls more on one person not the other), and get rid of the take-aways.  Perhaps, design a research paper that actually forces students to present and synthesize the research we were supposed to have understood from this class.  As for the take-home final, do not put it in the middle of finals week.  Release it earlier.  It's a take-home final, not a real one, so don't put it during a time in which everyone is stressed out as is, especially, when the professor initially had told us it would be released and due prior to finals week concluding.

            "\u00a0The material the course covered was amazing, but the delivery at times felt off. Articles assigned were long and only truly tested on during the final, which made keeping up with the material quite difficult at times. The slides went over the readings well, but there did seem to be some knowledge gap between what was assigned and what was lectured on. That being said, the material was incredible and very important. I loved the Ted Talk assignment, but as odd as it sounds, I wish we had more assignments. 90% of our grade was split between three assignments, which to me does not accurately represent the total body of work each student puts into the class. ",
            "\u00a0I was a little disappointed with this course. I think it would be more beneficial to have the course broken up into 2 shorter lectures per week as opposed to 1 long lecture once a week. I found it hard to stay focused, however that's my own personal learning style. The course material was certainly interesting, but perhaps a little elementary for some students. It felt like we were learning the material solely to satisfy a course requirement. The TED Talk was fun to prepare, and it was interesting listening to my classmates' talks. The weekly discussions were generally a good supplement to the course. ",
            "\u00a0While I was excited for this course at the beginning of the semester, I quickly came to dread EPH 507 week after week. The only strength this course has is that it addresses important issues in the field of public health. Its weaknesses can be examined in three broad categories:\r\n1. Structure: This class included a 2-hour lecture on Tuesdays and a 50-minute discussion session the following Monday. Because the lecture was so long and students were more focused on the discussion session, this structure discouraged students from attending the lecture altogether. Additionally, many students (including myself) completed the readings for the Tuesday lecture, and by the time we had discussion a week later, we didn't remember the content well enough to have a productive discussion. Additionally, from the student perspective, it seemed as though Trace wanted even the lecture to take on a \"discussion feel,\" so it was even more puzzling that between 3 hours of class time each week, less than 1 hour (6 days later) was dedicated for a small-group discussion. Overall, I think this class was trying to accomplish too much and should either be a lecture or a discussion-based class. If the instructor insists on maintaining this dual-format, the discussion should be within a couple of days of the lecture, and perhaps the lecture should be shorter and the discussion longer. \r\n2. Content and professor/TF: The content of this class included very sensitive topic areas and I did not think the professor nor my TF were respectful or sensitive. Both in lecture and in discussion, the professor and TF reviewed these topics at a highly-academic level. However, when students raised questions or thoughts about the content, the professor rarely waited for the student to finish his or her thought before interrupting. Additionally, student's experiences of the course overall were highly dependent on who they had as their TF. For instance, some TFs were more open and collaborative with students. This only reinforced my thoughts that this class was flawed. \r\n3. Assignments and grading: I fail to see how any of the assignments were useful for learning the material for this class. Creating \"creative\" assignments (i.e. Ted Talk rather than a presentation and op-ed rather than a paper) served only to confuse and frustrate students rather than provide an engaging platform with which students can engage with material. The assignments themselves are also extremely vague, yet the professor/TF clearly had a specific idea of what they were looking for and took points off of assignments in a way that was unclear to the students. In other words, the assignments themselves were confusing the and were harshly graded. Furthermore, I found the grading for other parts of this course to be extremely insulting for a graduate level program. 10% of our final grade was for participation based on the content and quality of what one says. While this may have been in place to encourage participation in both the discussion and in lecture, it instead caused many students to feel stress over what they wanted to contribute to discussion. In many cases (myself included), students would make sure to participate once and sit quietly during the rest of the discussion. In lectures, many students would write their take-aways either in the first few minutes of class or remotely and not attend class at all. The entire participation system caused stress and resentment among students and did not allow us to feel more engaged or connected with the material. I am confident I (and many other students) would have enjoyed this class if the assignments and grading were done in a way that made more sense for a graduate level course. \r\n\r\nI think this class can be improved by either eliminating it and allowing incoming MPH students to choose from a selection of SBS courses, or restructuring this course entirely. Specifically, this course would be better suited for either a lecture or a discussion setting. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I would be hard-pressed to find a more important and pressing issue in public health.\r\n\r\nWeakness: That said, it was a very frustrating class. I found that the readings were often over-simplified in the classroom, in addition, many students rarely read the readings (nor were they incentivized to), and the classes (either large lectures or hyper-structured seminars) did not provide any opportunities to engage or wrestle with the material. I often left classes and lectures frustrated by the lack of engagement and critical thinking.\r\n\r\nMy primary suggestions to improve the class: (1) require the class in a later period  of a student's career (e.g. second semester), when students have more public health related skills to apply (e.g., epidemiology,  statistics, economics); (2) classroom discussions: just stick to carefully examining the readings (or some other shared issue); (3) Ted talks work much better when they come from someone's own experience--better to have students instead selected to lead the literature discussions. ",

Especially for a social justice course, I think it would be great for the instructor to spend a few minutes reflecting on his own identities, and how they shape his opinions and his journey to the platform he has now. I think because the class is mostly white, it's cool that a PoC or some other person with a similarly stigmatize identity is not required to expend energy teaching to a white crowd.

For example, after a breakout and he would ask for people's ideas on a certain topic, sometimes people would say pretty outrageous things that were not socially just but Trace never commented on why some thoughts/programs could be problematic. I think it would have been helpful if Trace could comment on people's suggestions because I think it would have helped with everyone understanding why that idea is problematic but also bring more context/history in as to how a lot of ideas that people have are problematic due to historical context/how we were raised but we can change our mindsets. I think Trace could have challenged us a little bit more in terms of class by not just having us do breakouts but maybe showing more case studies that compare and contrast how things have been done and what pros and cons of these studies were. I also think it would have been nice to include some more history into this class because a lot of the reasons why a lot of health disparities exist is because of some historical event. I think that context would be really helpful because by learning more about the history, we can analyze how new initiatives can begin to help address some of these issues since we know that most health problems are not due to face-value issues but rather underlying, systemic, pervasive societal problems. I think Trace could also be a bit more specific about his assignments: sometimes I was never really sure what I was supposed to explain more about, especially when we had a word limit on most assignments.

One that sticks out is when describing our ted talk assignments and expressing how he would not like to do the assignment himself. That didn't sit too well, because I just feel like I want my professors to be excited about assignments they assign instead of expressively pessimistic, but again this was an isolated incident. Trace brought humor and seriousness to topics that were heavy, and he has introduced us all to so many assets of public health and social justice in general that will make us better public health practitioners.

            "\u00a0I get the impression that Trace had the best intentions and high hopes for this class, and quickly became equally as frustrated as the students. While Trace clearly is passionate about the topic area of the course, I did not find him effective in a large-lecture and got the impression throughout the semester that he would have been more comfortable in a smaller setting. For example, Trace's lecture slides included routinely misinterpreted data or inaccurate data. Specifically, in one lecture about the relationship between poverty and health, Trace provided incorrect figures for the federal poverty level. Additionally, when students asked questions or tried to provide their own insights in class, he rarely allowed them to finish their thought before interrupting with his impression on what he thought the student was trying to ask. \r\n\r\nTrace's assignments and grading style would also clearly be better in a smaller setting. The assignments were intended to provide students an opportunity to engage \"creatively\" with the material in the form of a \"Ted Talk\" rather than a presentation and an \"op-ed\" rather than an essay. I'm sure Trace intended these assignments to be a nice break from other assignments in other classes, but in reality, this format coupled with the intensely vague prompt created much more confusion about the assignment itself and forced students fo focus more on the mechanics of an op-ed or a ted talk rather than understanding the material. Additionally, the 10% participation grade wherein students are graded on the content and quality of what they say may work in a small setting, but for this course (especially as a graduate level course), the participation grade was insulting and in discussion sessions resulted in some students talking just to be heard and others (including myself) making a point to say one intelligent thing and then remain silent the rest of the class time. The take-aways were equally as flawed, and I'm sure provided much more work for the professor than initially anticipated. These assignments and grading format make far more sense for a small class than a large lecture. \r\n\r\nOverall, Trace's teaching style is much better suited for a small, discussion-based class. ",

His lectures were not engaging, and the lack of participation was not due to the lack of interest, it was because he was hard to follow and seemed to only be looking for answers he wanted. His grading was also systematically unfair. The rubrics provided were incredibly vague while the criteria he has privately was nitpicky and asked too much out of opinion pieces with low word limits. I also found that with the end of class response pieces he was hesitant to give me full marks no matter what approach I took to my analysis, even though I attended all of the classes my participation grade doesn't reflect that.

            "\u00a0At its current state, the course does a poor job of delivering the macro level problems that inhibit health equity. While it is necessary and the information is important, it is not worth your time to attend or do the readings week to week. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend. While I do believe everyone should take a social justice class after learning so much about it, I feel I did not learn nearly as much as I could have. The material was not presented clearly in class or in slides. ",

            "\u00a0From my experience, the course is beneficial in that it teaches things that are crucial for public health, but is in serious need of revision in regards to instruction style and time allocation between lecture and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this overall, however, I do think there needs to be more guidance so that students can actually feel that they gained something from the course. The way that it was set up, we talked about overarching material but did not necessarily have the terms to fully discuss the material. I would have loved a more concrete set of definition or theories to pull from to be better woven and explicitly stated in the lectures and discussion and to be given a more concrete way to review the material, such as questions to answer every week (see above). I feel that people who were already savvy to this information had a lot of room to tune out or to only pay attention to what they cared about in the realm of social justice and were not forced to challenge their beliefs and that those who do not necessarily care about these topics would have been able to take away that racism is bad and not actually engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course focuses broadly on issues of social justice with practical application through assignments by writing an op-ed and delivering a TED Talk.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend the course to another student unless the structural changes addressed above were implemented. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say it's a pretty comprehensive introduction to the broad fields of health equity and social justice. I'd say it mostly targets a white audience, which can be frustrating for students of color. I would still recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0No. But it's required. But maybe someone else who cares about the topics should be the one teaching it. ",

Ways to improve heath equity and become a better human being and health provider are presented in this class. I would recommend this course to a fellow student because it provided extremely important knowledge that is vital for everyone entering the health field. ",
            "\u00a0I think for people with limited exposure to this type of material, this course does an okay job at introducing them to it. For those with background, I would recommend trying to take other more engaging and intellectual stimulating courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good for an overview of social justice topics for those who may have not been exposed to this kind of information before. However, I think the course could use some restructuring to make it more engaging and encourage participation. Overall, I would recommend this course for the topics discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Not to any people of color, it almost felt like welcome to racism 101 for my white peers but left me very dry.  Needs to be more radical in my opinion ",
            "\u00a0For students with no background in social justice or health equity (which is likely not the case in public health), this is a very cursory overview of some main issues in public health and social justice. Not for folks with any experience or exposure to the issues. Not a practical course. I would not recommend were it not a core course. I really wanted to like this course and thought based on the course name and instructor that this would be one of my favorite classes but it fell short of my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0(Not that they would have a choice!), but I would recommend it to all incoming students interested in learning more about how inequities affect society at every level in complex ways. ",
            "\u00a0I hope the course sees a change in instruction and organization of discussion sections. Material was alright but it did not feel meaningful when huge issues like environmental racism and medical bias were glazed over week by week. Perhaps assignments could encourage students to engage more personally by asking students to recall personal experiences as related to course material. ",
            "\u00a0Sigh...I wish this class were better than it was. \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n+ Covers information that public health students need to know! \r\n+ Mandatory discussion section was annoying but essential for learning the information\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Going to class felt like a waste of time. Since many of the topics discussed in one class sitting could be taught as individual courses, information covered in class was very surface level, so students who had any amount of previous exposure to this information were left wanting more. \r\n- The studies used in class to supplement the main discussion were often poorly described and did not seem to properly flow with what Trace was trying to communicate. Often times the study conclusions seemed like a major stretch from what we were discussing in class.\r\n- Trace could have been a better professor. He says that he cares about this material, but the way he presented himself and the information in class gave off a vibe that he didn't. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly manageable workload for much of the semester. Dont underestimate the TED talk though! Dont try to cram too much info into it! Trace is funny as hell. This will be a very thought provoking class thatll balance off the more directly analytical core coursework in Epi and Biostats. ",
            "\u00a010 out of 10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The course is essentially an overview of social justice from a public health perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to social justice, for anyone who has never taken a social justice class before. I would recommend it for people who have either never thought critically about social justice or has never taken a class on social justice or something similar. I think the class could have gone a bit more in-depth without seeming too overwhelming but overall still a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this to other students. The interested students may explore with the class, but others may find it unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for a student who has little to no past experience with the social justice aspects of public health. I think students who are already familiar with the concepts covered in this course might find this class to be a review of these concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The component that dealt with actual health outcomes and the history leading to inequities was great but there was too much focus on deconstructing identity and intersectionality. The sections were helpful but also sometimes drifted into discussions that had nothing to do with health. ",
            "\u00a0Learning about the social determinants of health and how they create health differences among the population. While not diagnosable health issues, the social determinants of health have extraordinary effects of disease development, health outcomes and access to equitable healthcare. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend a more advanced version of this course to anyone studying public health, but would hope it becomes more in depth and less basic moving forward. It seems like a fantastic opportunity to heavily influence YSPH students' approaches to public health and commitment to social justice, but in order to do so it needs to challenge students more. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to fellow students. The class really lacked engaging teaching and the final exam was way to extensive for the class and what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good foundation course but not extremely new for someone who has a bit of medical anthropology/sociology background. I'm glad all students are required to take it but there wasn't much new material for me. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend a full course on this subject, but rather a series of shorter lectures with longer discussions. Less focus on theories and more on solution generating. ",
            "\u00a0While the material addressed in this course is important, the format is not the greatest. I would recommend it to another student if the format were to change. ",
            "\u00a0would recommend if the course saw a restructuring in time distribution ",
            "\u00a0It's a challenge for International students. Since some of us don't have much basic knowledge of American culture, some supplement materials for international students might be of great help. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to fellow students. It is an important class to take due to the bubble that Yale and most undergraduate colleges provide from the outside. It is eye-opening with respect to health issues plaguing communities of color and communities that are impoverished and how they stem from structural and historical factors. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a lot of interesting and important material, but it does end up often presenting far-left ideas as if they are settled questions. There were many times when I disagreed with a particular assertion, but felt I couldn't say so or even ask a clarifying question. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it.  It was designed with good intentions but ends up being an ivory tower glimpse at some issues in social justice and health equity.  Grading is unclear and course assignments are elementary and time consuming.  There are plenty of other courses more worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0The course is of critical importance. You learn topics that will upset, infuriate, and inspire you. Take everything in, engage in the course, and truly try to grasp the importance of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is something every public health should have exposure to, but I would recommend the course in a different format. I think the weekly lectures should be broken up into 2. I think the 50-minute discussions were also on the short side to fully get into a discussion after the weekly TED Talks. ",
            "\u00a0This class aims to provide a foundational understanding about core concepts related to health equity. I think having this understanding is important in the field of public health, but this course did not effectively teach what it set out to do. I would not recommend this course to another student. For reasons stated above, it is a complete mess and should be re-structured for next year or completely eliminated. Frankly, after taking this class, I am hesitant to take another SBS course for fear that it will have the same fatal flaws. ",
            "\u00a0Very frustrating. I could not in good conscience recommend it to another student. \r\n\r\nI may be wrong, but I have the impression that Yale's other professional schools (law and business) are faced with students outside their programs trying to take their core classes. I don't think I can say the same would happen for this class--and that is a problem because YSPH could offer a more engagiong class that challenged and shaped future public health practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course and introduction to the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I highly recommend the administration change the format of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the content of the social justice class should be continued as a requirement for public health students. I would encourage a restructuring of the current lecture/discussion periods to facilitate better learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for MPH students and is a helpful introduction to social justice concepts. However it was the first time the course existed this semester and it definitely needs some improvements and tweaks. The course struggled due to the size of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for students who do not have any background in the social determinants of health. However, for students with a background in community based participatory research, implementing public health programs, and working with diverse, marginalized communities, the class may be repetitive and redundant.
