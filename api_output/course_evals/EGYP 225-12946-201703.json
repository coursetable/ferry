            "\u00a0I learned so much through haptic learning. I learned a lot of history and rituals from ancient Egypt. ",

            "\u00a0We learned about mummification practices in Ancient Egypt over the course of history and the religious beliefs surrounding it. We also had the opportunity to mummify fish ourselves and do research with animal mummies in the Peabody's collection. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course about ancient Egyptian burials, coffins, sarcophagi, mummification practices, rituals, amulets, and much more. I also was able to learn via a hands-on approach--as our class was able to mummify fish and practice experimental archaeology. "

            "\u00a0Very hands on and fun ",
            "\u00a0The course felt somewhat disorganised at times as the overall plan for what we were doing in the course changed significantly after the syllabus was written. However, the coursework itself was interesting and the numerous field trips and projects were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would not change this course in any way. The strengths were that the seminar was taught in a very conversational manner--which meant I learned a lot without ever noticing how much I was truly learning. Dr. Ikram always wrote key terms up on the board, which greatly helped us to succeed on our quizzes. Additionally, the hands-on learning approach of being able to actually practice mummification was very exciting, and taught us a lot. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Ancient Egypt, or really to anyone interested in taking a fun class where you will learn a lot. The class was so different from any other class I've taken at Yale, and I learned so much working in the lab with the fish mummification. "
