            "\u00a0This course taught me about how to use different style elements in my writing to compliment my purpose, tone, and topic. It also taught me how to reflect on myself and the world around me and how to synthesize those thoughts into writing. It also pushed me to write more creatively, which is rare in academic settings. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, I became a better writer and reader by taking this course. In regards to writing, this class really changed my personal paradigm on writing. I was brought up to write clearly formatted, structured writing pieces which did not allow much room for creativity. This class changed that, and I was constantly surprised by the techniques and things I could try to get my point across in a creative and engaging way. It was the first time I was on the \"opposite side\" of the writing spectrum of students, that is to say, instead of writing an analysis of a literary piece, we were the ones trying to write that piece. It pushed me to constantly be in a state of slight discomfort, since writing has never been my strong suit. That insight alone can be applicable to one's Yale experience: you will get the most out of Yale by pushing yourself to take classes you might be afraid of. ",
            "\u00a0I have a much better idea of what I do wrong in writing, which has helped me go into writing immensely. This class made me much more aware of my inherent biases in writing, and it taught me to take risks and try new things. I got a sense of renewed love for literature and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely developed my writing skills a ton. ",
            "\u00a0I became a lot better at reading analytically and writing. Through this course, I engaged with text more deeper than I had before, and was able to better marry the skills of reading for content and reading for authorial choices/organizational structure. I read some genres I might not have ever touched otherwise, which was a lot of fun, ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking ability, learning to analyze different essays, different techniques of making essays concise. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze nonfiction writing, and write papers with multiple drafts. Learned how to peer review other papers, revise our own, and cover a variety of nonfiction topics. ",
            "\u00a0This class has completely rewired how I think about writing nonfiction. I had never before thought about \"the modern essay\" as a genre of writing. Our work enabled me to experience its versatility and its powerful ability to convey an author's opinion, as we were prompted to look for inspiration from our own lives. For the first time, I came to believe in writing as a vehicle for my voice, as a form which I had complete control over, down to every sentence and every word. I came to see writing as a skill I can cultivate for the rest of my life. \r\n\r\nEnglish 120 has also broadened my views of writing as an academic discipline. I didn't even know what The New Yorker was until a month into this class, and now it's one of my favorite things ever! Sometimes I come upon authors who we've read in class, and I can be like, hey! I know them! and that's a pretty cool feeling. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to write using detail rather than downright explanation. I learned a new style of writing- creative nonfiction- that I didnt previously know I loved. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved significantly. That's my main takeaway from the course. Aside from that, this was the first college English class I've taken and I learned how, where, and when I am best able to read and write. I incorporated the readings into my daily routine, often as breakfast entertainment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about essay writing that I had never learned about in all of my years of school. I learned how to read critically and analyze other pieces of writing. I learned how to edit my own writing. "

            "\u00a0This course was very well organized. All of our readings were directly tied to our essay topics and provided useful insight into choices we could make in our own writing. Although I often did not enjoy the Zinsser readings, I found the insights from it to be extremely helpful when writing my essays. In short, this course's strength lies in the interconnectedness of the work.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would improve about the course it to try to even out the workload a bit. There were sometimes when we barely had any reading and then others when all of our readings were very long. This made it hard to balance my time with other classes because I never really knew how much reading to expect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging, interesting, instructive readings from a diverse range of topics, styles, and genres helped to teach lessons on what makes good nonfiction writing. Drafts were due weekly, which ensured that there would be ample time spent on refining one's writing and synthesizing the things we learned in class. The professor made herself available for personal meetings which further helped improve my writing and showed me things I had never even considered before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No complaints, I just wish there was more time for me to work on my essays to really produce a work I was satisfied with, but maybe no such work exists. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lie in the great readings, the amazing feedback the professor gave, and in the really engaging class discussions. I'd say this class is almost perfect. The only thing I'd say needs improving is switching out some of the essays that were not as engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class discussions are great because everyone brings different ideas to the table and it's fun to engage that way. The peer workshopping and teacher edits on papers really allow you to look at your writing in different lenses and see what kinds of things you can improve. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: In class discussions were always super interesting in terms of going over different styles of writing and what exactly makes them so good.\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe allocate more time to improve individual students' essays more. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very self driven which I liked. I also liked how we got feedback on our rough drafts before handing in our final drafts. One weakness was that the class was entirely discussion driven, and often students didn't engage and it was just a small group of students and the instructor talking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  the diversity of sources and authors we're assigned to read, the pacing of the course, the interesting and unique unit topics, the high feedback we had, the engaging discussions we would have in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class should be longer. One hour isn't enough to facilitate a deep discussion on all the readings we've been assigned. ",
            "\u00a0The readings could be guided a bit better with questions but the essay feedback and workshops are great. ",
            "\u00a0The course's main objective was to make us better writers and it succeeded. Some specific readings such as the one on hipsters or the one on tattoos didn't give me much. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness would be not having much turn-around time between starting a new essay unit and having to turn in the first draft of that essay. I always felt like I was rushing to write my first draft because I had only picked my topic about two days before and we had just started reading examples three days before. I think the only way for this to be rectified would be making the essay deadline Saturday or Sunday night for everyone, including workshoppers. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it prompted me to reflect deeply and in a meaningful way about my life and the world around me. It was also nice to have the freedom to write creatively and about what I wanted to. It was a refreshing break from the structured, academic writing I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0I'd highly recommend this course to anyone of all majors. Writing is a skill that everyone needs to learn to be able to communicate effectively and intelligently with other human beings. If that reason isn't enough, consider this: you only live one life, and at some point, you might realize you don't want to just let the time slip away from your fingertips, so you start to write. In that moment, being able to write good prose will be invaluable. Lastly, I believe this course may change the \"filter\" through which you engage with the world. Since good writing requires intense and deep thought to reveal the things that are kept the most hidden, you might start to perceive the world in a different way, looking out for those hidden or glossed over things. You might realize some things are intentionally hidden, and that will be extremely interesting and profound. Other times, that hidden things will just be something no one has considered before, or few have pointed out, and then you realize how much more life has to offer than what you thought before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes!! It teaches you so much about how to think about writing and will leave you more ready for writing assignments to come! The professor puts a lot of energy into giving feedback, which is extremely helpful. The readings were really fun and honestly felt like homework breaks rather than whole workloads. It's not a crazy amount of work, with great benefits! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - the skills that you develop are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It's a great intro writing course and makes you feel a lot better prepared to take on more English classes (especially writing ones) in the future. The amounts of writing and reading you do in the class balance really well and are a fair amount of fun if you engage. ",
            "\u00a0Depends if you want to learn about rhetorical analysis or not. Great seminar in my experience, even as someone who is not majoring in English. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good introduction to nonfiction writing and the workload is not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0Totally! What are you doing at Yale if you aren't taking English 120? You get different and exciting readings twice a week, you get to write about whatever interests you for each essay, and you get to workshop your drafts in a totally nonjudgemental setting. It should be noted, however, that work for this class takes a lot more time relative to other classes (because of the brainstorming, drafting, writing process), and the amount of latitude you're given for assignments can be stress inducing at times. I think it's worth it though, as you're basically acquiring a skill for life. As someone more STEM oriented, who also wasn't very into writing before this class, I highly recommend it! Just know that it /is/ quite a lot of work, and you have to do your work very thoroughly to improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even though there is a lot of work it is extremely rewarding and a totally new style of writing that isnt academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The readings were actually interesting and the papers were fun to write. It is definitely a lot of work, but taking the class has been a truly rewarding experience. This course has everything I wanted in a Yale course--intellectually stimulating, assignments that are fun to do, readings that are engaging, and discussions that are thought provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and I already have. It improved my writing and was enjoyable because of the open ended essay prompts and the enjoyable readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would very much recommend this course. It was a great introductory college writing course. You basically get to write about yourself and things you are interested in the whole time, so writing the essays is actually kind of fun. The workload isn't terrible, simply just five essays and short reading responses in between. "
