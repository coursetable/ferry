I understand the how the researcher arrived at the statistics and how they evaluate and analyze whether their information is plausible or not. Furthermore, I can also question the results of these papers. more and more in today's era, these skills are necessary to be able to get by.

We did the full AP Calculus circuit in high school and then took the class at my local university senior year before coming to Yale. The nave \"prospective Global Affairs\" major I am shopped this course; I have never been catfished so hard in my life (or really at all, for that matter, but the sentiment remains). The class is billed as an introductory lecture but is far, far from it. My friends with a background in stats sailed through the first few class sessions and subsequent assignments. I did not. That being said, I did learn a fair amount. The class uses the Stata data package so I learned how to code? Like what was that? If I'm stopped on the street and asked about heteroskedasticity, I'll have an answer. I feel qualified to absolutely DESTROY a study's credibility on the basis of sample size or failure to deploy small-sample methodology. This knowledge is p o w e r f u l. ",

I appreciated the effort put into demonstrating practical applications of all of the concepts learns and how they could be related to research design, policy analysis and a suite of other useful skills. This class was a tremendous help in my ability to think critically about not only statistics, but papers and research presented to me in my other classes. ",

The course does start to escalate quickly toward the end but Justin always warned us about that and made sure that he had office hours available and made sure that everyone was clear on the previous topic before he moved on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is a very engaging lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas was engaging and insightful. He was willing to answer questions and clarify content. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is really useful for doing research in the future and the materials summarize the book very well.\r\nWeaknesses: Upload the problem set a bit late so that students have shorter time to finish it and the problem solution did not give a comprehensive explanation. ",

Other than that, every decision or practice problem has its intention and actually helps you learn rather than trying to beat you down. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome teacher, great structure to the class\r\n\r\nAnswer keys for psets and more detailed answer keys for practice exams would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Thomas is AMAZING and the class is structure exceptionally well. The PSETS are topical, not very hard, and help develop the lessons taught in class.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Thomas alone has the answers which makes it very difficult to seek help if you have a question. While he is very open to meeting and answering emails, it's a big class which makes it difficult to get a spot with him in office hours. TF's are very kind, but honestly don't have the answers the Professor is looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JT is really nice and tries to make the class interesting. His \"life and times\" made each lecture more fun. The material is super applicable to all other classes.\r\nWeaknesses: While useful, the course material can be very dry. It can feel like you have to do a lot of busy work, like learn how to calculate chi squared and gamma by hand, which requires a long series of calculations. Moreover, the p-sets often felt repetitive. You would have to do the same small sample means test over and over. I agree practice is good, but this was too much. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is literally incredible, he made the course so engaging even though it was just stats. He really stressed the importance of application of these concepts in our work or real life experiences. However, that being said, the specificity of terminology and technicality of wording for the 'correct answer' seemed very contradictory to this mind set and was not beneficial. Also, the TAs were very unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend that the professor spend less time calling out/calling on students in lecture to explain the material and instead explain it more thoroughly himself. ",
            "\u00a0strength: very organized and pretty straightforward class. The homework and tests were very reflective of the class material. JT made the class very engaging, which made me want to go to class. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes explanations were repetitive, which isn't actually a bad thing because I really learned the material. just an observation... ",
            "\u00a0JT is the biggest strength of this course. Lecture is FUN, which I cannot believe I'm saying about an applied stats class. He is goofy and teaches stats in a super approachable way. He never makes you feel stupid for not understanding something, and office hours are a joy with him. Also, the workload of this course was reasonable and APPROACHABLE. Like I didn't die doing a pset on my own, which was such a weight off of my shoulders. My TF, Brian, was also the best. Section could be improved by having it BEFORE psets are due, and using them to review theoretical concepts as well as STATA. As the course is now, section is only used for learning STATA, but I think I could have understood material better on a week-to-week basis if some time was set aside for concept review and questions. I also would suggest that Justin and the TFs hold more office hours during the time between when psets are released and due. Psets were released on Friday, due on Wednesday, but section was on Thursday, which was unhelpful for me, personally. More comments on Psets would be super helpful! Or just posting pset solutions. It would have been helpful to know where I went wrong on a problem without having to trek to office hours every week. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness of the course was the fact that answer keys to the problem sets and midterms were not posted. When they were graded, points were simply taken off and the correct answers were not supplied. Most people who lost points on the tests did so because of errors in the technical wording of interpretations of statistical analysis, as well as the theory behind what we learned in class. It felt like there was inadequate practice to prepare students to perform both of these things, particularly the theory, which was not well represented in the lecture slides. As for strengths, JT is a talented teacher whose classes were very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging professor who encourages class participation even in a large lecture. He makes himself very available to meet outside of class and really cares that the students understand the lesson. The problem sets were pretty repetitive and time consuming but that may help with over class learning. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well taught and engaging, despite it being a lecture. I wish TFs were more available to meet with students before problem sets were due--i.e. class office hours or something like that separate from JT's individual meetings. I also wish that TFs explained/wrote WHAT we got wrong/what the right answer was on problem sets as opposed to just writing \"-1\". This would have made it easier to learn from mistakes for the final. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: GREAT professor; very important material, good class!\r\n\r\nWeakness: not much I can think of! Sometimes more clarity in the lecture notes would be helpful; also, in sample midterms/finals/psets, it is not helpful to see \"refer to lecture notes...\" maybe include which lecture? or write out what kinds of interpretations are expected? \r\n\r\nSTATA is cool but also I think learning R would be cool too--maybe not feasible though. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets for this course would sometimes be redundant and tedious, but I did learn from them. When problem sets were graded, oftentimes points would be taken off without explanation. The exams were fair and appropriately tested my knowledge of the material (no tricks). The lectures were well-organized. Notes from section should be posted sooner, rather than the day before problem sets are due or even after. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas was really great and approachable. I wish his power points were slightly more accessible. Oftentimes they were less than helpful when reviewing the material. The problem sets were also not all the fun, especially since solutions and parameters for how they were being graded were never really laid out clearly. I would recommend that Professor Thomas offer a \"drop one\" policy for the psets. ",
            "\u00a0JT is absolutely awesome and a great teacher and I don't think I would have liked the course at all if he weren't teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Professor Thomas is an amazing professor, who makes a point to know everyone's name and even was willing to meet with me and a bunch of other students for 20 minutes every week to field questions about that week's material. He is the biggest strength of this class, and gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to do well in this class (which is hard for me as someone who doesn't lean toward quantitative material). \r\n- Professor Thomas spends a lot of time explaining each concept so that even people who don't like quantitative material can understand them. \r\n- The PSETs were really helpful, especially considering that they're always related to what's tested on the midterm/exam. The things that we learn are also applicable in real life. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The class does move a bit quickly, sometimes I found myself not being able to write down any material on the slide before the next one came up. \r\n- When you get questions wrong on the PSET or the midterm, there is nothing written as even a brief explanation of why you're wrong. There also aren't any PSET answers posted.\r\n- I would've appreciated if the key to the sample final exam didn't have so many \"see lecture notes.\" ",
            "\u00a0Cant think of any ways to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0It moves very slowly, such that I got bored with the material after all the times we had to drill it in lecture. I will say, though, that this does make you internalize the theoretical concepts behind what's happening in these stats methods. Sometimes felt like it was designed for the kids who miss lecture a lot, since it's a requirement for the Global major that nobody really wants to take. JT is an engaging lecturer, which is what saves the course -- if he didn't teach it, it would've been pretty unbearable. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures give you the information necessary to take on the psets. It was never insanely complex and the professor was more than wlling to entertain questions to help people understand. ",
            "\u00a0(Disclaimer:  I probably got an A or A- in this course.) \r\n\r\nThe course was great, but could have been even better. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Justin Thomas is one of the funniest and most engaging lecturers Ive ever had. He keeps you attentive throughout the semester and seems to genuinely care about having his students learn important lessons about statistics. The unapologetic focus on applicability, rather than theory, works well for the purpose of the course and I think wed all be better off if every college graduate became familiar with the material taught in GLBL 121.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was really a shame that we got behind schedule and ultimately learned less material than planned. The topic of multivariate regression really seems to be essential to what the course aims to teach, and despite it being on the syllabus, we didnt spend as much as a second on it. I dont really understand why, because Prof. Thomas recognized we were behind with a whole month left of the semester, yet continued to do the things that caused us to progress slowly through the material: telling funny stories and taking tens of questions from students every lecture. The funny stories should probably stay, because its pretty unique for a lecture class to be this fun. But Prof. Thomas might want to cut down on the student involvement. If you try to turn a 60-80 person lecture into an interactive seminar, youre bound to waste a lot of time that couldve been used to cover material. Its great to take questions from students, but that doesnt mean its necessary to try and involve us on every single slide of a lecture. On average, we probably spent 10 minutes *per lecture* waiting for students to raise their hands or in addition to the 10 minutes spent addressing questions that could be discussed at office hours. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that could improve the course, in my opinion, would be to have more homework relating to actual social science papers. I know other introductory stats classes have you critique the methodology of selected papers and that sounds like a really good way of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Although a major requirement, I found this class to be extremely compelling. Professor Thomas did an excellent job of explaining the ways in which class material could be applied to the real worldwhether it be through a future job, or when reading a scholarly paper. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are due every two weeks, which is good because that means that once every two weeks, everyone in the class is up late panicking over not understanding a Stata command or how to apply some statistical method to a problem. Solidarity! The lecture slides are very detailed, and any misunderstandings can be cleared up in the textbook. Sections, I think, should be dedicated to practice with the material and not for Stata, but since it's on the psets, I guess it makes sense. The TAs post notes on how to use Stata on Canvas, which is great if you don't go to section. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not assume prior knowledge of statistics in any way, but having some knowledge will give you a massive advantage over other students who are starting with nothing. Additionally, the problem set work heavily involves using a statistical program on the computer which you are not formally tested on. Performing well on the problem sets does not necessarily correlate with performing well on the tests. This leads to quite a bit of cramming before exams because the problem sets do not represent the content which are tested on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is definitely the best part about this course because he makes the lectures very interesting and informative. I really appreciated how straightforward the problems sets and tests were because I could focus on learning a skill or concept rather than worry about trick questions that might arise. In terms of weaknesses, I didn't think section was super helpful beyond teaching us a few Stata commands. Also, it was really difficult to learn from one's mistakes because we weren't given any feedback on problem sets, and the answer keys to practice tests often said \"look at the lecture slides, book, and notes.\" Even if it said, \"check out lecture 14\" or something, that would be better. ",
            "\u00a0This course benefitted from having an enthusiastic professor who was heavily engaged with the classroom and provided an engaging environment in which students could ask and answer questions about the subject material in a freer, lecture setting. It could have benefitted from offering tutoring sessions for students who were taking statistics for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- real life applicable content. Lecture is engaging and informative and USEFUL of students time, unlike other courses. JT is one of the best Teachers at Yale, and I say \"teaching\" because that is what he does. He actually cares about teaching students and engaging with them rather than being \"just a professor\" and teaching a course because it's a part of his job. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- can't really complain. He made a rather bland subject into an engaging experience and made most of students' time with class content and the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Thomas really cares about students and wants everyone to do their best and so he kept lectures (which for stats can be pretty boring) as lively as possible. Not sure how this course could be improved because the psets were truly useful in terms of facilitating learning, they just took FOREVER to complete which was annoying and I often felt that I could not dedicate the time necessary to do well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0We should definitely have gotten model answers to problem sets and exams after the fact! I never felt like I knew what the correct answers were, and TAs didn't know either at times. I felt like it was hard to learn when I didn't know where I went wrong on problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing and everything was a strength. I do wish that we hadn't taken so long learning the non-linear regression part of the class, because I felt like we were really really solidified the easiest part of the class and zipped through everything else at the speed of light. I also wish we could've used R instead of Stata since R is what is most commonly used in the 'real world'. ",
            "\u00a0Organization could have potentially been a little bettersometimes I felt like I didn't know where to look. The TF's also seemed very very unreachable at times. However, the professor, JT, was an absolute saint who both really cares about his material and was always willing to schedule more office hours to help out his students. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized. The weakness was that section felt somewhat disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0I wish he posted psets when he actually said he was going to post the psets as well as the other materials. also if he released answer keys that said more than \"see lecture notes\" that would also be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - JT is a great professor and was always available to meet with students\r\nWeaknesses - problem sets are sometimes incorrectly graded/graded too harshly, and overall the problem sets were significantly more difficult than the material covered in class ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is very engaging in lecture and does a good job teaching the course material. I think the course could be improved by making the sets shorter and less repetitive. Also, I don't think stata programming should play as much of a role in the class as it does. ",
            "\u00a0This class attracts just about every hardo enrolled at Yale College. My eyes literally hurt from the sheer frequency with which I would roll them at students' responses to a question. It is taught as a large lecture but Professor Thomas makes LUCE 101 feel much smaller. He attempts, in earnest, to learn students' names (with mixed success) and creates a fun classroom environment. Everything else about the class is the opposite of fun. Section is held in a basement computer lab and my computer's keyboard always had orange crust in it. Problem sets take SO LONG to complete (and even longer to grade). On the topic of grading, I found myself cheated out of points that I should have earned rather frequently. Don't expect a consistent grading scheme. 99% of the problems I find with this course can be solved with an enrollment cap. No more than 50 people should be allowed to take this course. Professor Thomas and the TFs seemed overwhelmed by the demands of 100+ students. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a very educational course that was well structured and organized. ",
            "\u00a0It was very difficult to receive feedback from this course. Problem sets were graded inconsistently, making it difficult to learn from the mistakes made on them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-paced, interesting material. Weaknesses: Poor instruction, bad teaching assistants, emphasis on specific interpretations rather than an understanding of the material, wildly inconsistent grading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Thomas is an incredible person and extremely helpful when you take the time to work with him and ask questions  outside of lecture. Cons: section is not helpful and the TAs are not accessible, also, grading feel arbitrary and lectures can be confusing ",
            "\u00a0JT really cares about being liked by his students but does not focus as much on teaching the material well. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments for this course could have been much more helpful to facilitate learning. They often involved doing very similar problems repeatedly and focused on small word choices. It also was hard to ever correct the small details because there were never any answer keys released. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. No weaknesses were noted. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course was very effective at providing a first time introduction to statistical analysis. While I think the skills I developed in this course are highly relevant, I don't believe I would be able to practically apply them until taking 122. While I can perform basic stata commands to do analyze data, I am still somewhat uncertain as to how I would conduct a study of my own for example. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the course could also be improved by spending a sufficient amount of time on each topic. I felt like some of the later classes rushed certain topics that deserved more teaching time than was allotted to them. I would have liked it if TAs provided more substantive feedback when grading our problem sets or if we were provided answer keys to problem sets after submission. This would allow for students to learn better from their mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0JT is absolutely what makes this course work. He presents the material in an interesting way, given the subject. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to statistics that is pretty accessible even if you have no background in the area. That said, I did feel like a lot of self teaching was required outside of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think JT is an awesome person and is good at making otherwise boring concepts seem interesting. I think that the class is graded too harshly (one point off for using a synonym of the right answer) and that TFs need to be more clear with what they want us to do - section shouldnt only cover stata material. ",
            "\u00a0There should really be another statistics option for those who have already taken AP Statistics, as this course follows the same curriculum until the very end.  If you have not taken AP Statistics, you may feel that the course feels a little rushed, in which case the textbook is your best go-to for clarification (online is best, as you can search for specific concepts more easily).  My biggest qualm is that grading throughout the entirety of the course consists of marking what is wrong but not saying why or what the correct answer is--problem set and midterm solutions are NOT shared--so you will likely continue to make the same mistakes throughout the entirety of the course without ever learning why unless you happen to have free time during TA office hours to literally go over every mistake. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a ton of strengths: a dynamic and hilarious instructor, helpfully-organized lecture notes, and a really rigorous commitment to teaching you the software you need to succeed at statistical methods. I can only think of two weaknesses: the fact that office hours are INCREDIBLY hard to book (they would sometimes fill up 1-2 minutes after they were posted) and that the model of section (teaching you the STATA code that you need to do that week's problem set) can be sort of unhelpful if you want to get a better grasp on the material. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this course!! I went into this class expecting to hate it--I need it for my major, but kept putting off taking it because I assumed that it would be a slog. I was so wrong it's ridiculous. I actually looked forward to lecture every day, and Professor Thomas (miraculously) made stats incredibly interesting and fun to learn about. My one criticism is that at times it felt like we were spending too much time going over pretty basic stuff. I understand that it's super important to have a firm grasp on the basics, so in a way I appreciated that, but at the same time I think we slowed down a little TOO much. Other than that though, I absolutely loved the class (especially Life & Times). ",
            "\u00a0I thought JT was a good lecturer, and I enjoyed his initial \"Life and Times\"at the start of lectures to get students interested. I also thought his method of asking  questions throughout the lecture was effective and helped to engage the class. The material was also fairly accessible for non-STEM students and appealed to students interested in policy. However, the PSETS were often long and time-consuming, and the questions were often repetitive. Both the PSETS and the exams were also graded very harshly with points taken off for wording issues and lack of precision in the explanation. The TAs also graded much differently on the exams than on the PSETS. An explanation that was given full credit on the PSET would only be given half credit on the exam. Points were often taken off in the PSETS but little to no explanation given.  I think it would have helped considerably if JT had posted an answer key to the exam and PSETs instead of having students meet with him separately. This way, students would have understood what was expected of them and what their answer had failed to include. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty well-designed; I personally thought the format/ teaching style were fitting. ",
            "\u00a0The class is taught by a fantastic and entertaining lecturer, but at times the topics can be difficult to grasp. Problem set answers were usually not posted, nor were answers to practice sets for exams. I think it would have helped if these tools were be offered to students. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organised. All the content was covered in a very systematic manner. The problem sets helped me better understand the concepts. I wish that Professor Thomas had a review session before the final though. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course definitely requires students to do the reading and work on their own to understand the concepts, but it really helps facilitate a very smooth intro to statistics for people (like myself) who have never taken it before. I felt challenged but the pace felt manageable, and I felt like there were definite support systems in place when I needed them. I found section with Brian really helpful, and the entire course really facilitated asking questions and working through the ideas to understand them, which I appreciated. I thought the course was well-organized and little things like the daily announcements helped with that. I found the problem sets time-consuming, which wouldn't have been as much of an issue except that because they were generally released on Friday morning and due the next Wednesday, there wasn't much time to meet with Professor Thomas before they were due, and I often wouldn't realize that I had problems understanding something until I got to the problem set, so I didn't have much to discuss with him before that. Also, the problem sets were almost always released after I had section, and my TF had office hours after classes on Wednesday, so it was hard to get in-person help on them when I needed it. Additionally, it would have been useful to know not just that you got something wrong on a p-set but what it was that you did incorrectly, but I also understand that the TFs have to grade a lot of p-sets, so that might be unrealistic. ",
            "\u00a0I think that when going over the a math problems in lecture the professor should go through each step fully at least once. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Thomas is a funny and engaging lecturer. Plenty of time for questions during class and 1-on-1 office hours. Interesting material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook was rather pointless. Discussion sections were more confusing than helpful. Didn't get through all the material. ",
            "\u00a0Remembering the specific wordings of things for the problem set was difficult. Then on the exam it was a tough lesson to learn when all of that specific wording was counted off against on the final. I think maybe to help with this, there could be some kind of sheet made with the specific wordings for the most popular things. I know that may seem like it is too easy for the students, but in a situation like that where there is no nuance in the wording and it needs to be exactly said a specific way, I think it is fair to ask for what is expected of us in a much more tangible way. I think a strength is how the professor is very personable, and his high energy made it much easier to stay engaged in the lecture hall. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-organized, well taught\r\nWeakness: Sometimes I felt that the course made me start predicting what to expect on the final especially since there are certain phrases that if you don't write, you'll get marked down--and it's those points that make the difference between an A, A-, B+, B.\r\nThere were times when the professor emailed important notes about the PSET the night before the PSET was due which hurt people who worked ahead of time\r\nThe TFs always posted things late (discussion section notes), and my TF has never answered any of my questions without saying \"I'm not sure\" or \"I don't know\" or \"Just ask Professor Thomas\" :( ",

LITERALLY HE IS ACTUALLY THE BEST, AND YOU WILL LOVE HIM REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU LIKE STATS. This is such an important class because it teaches you to be more literate when working with data (something you need in any field, but this class is specifically geared towards people going into social sciences). If you want to go into policy, research, psych, global, econ, anything, TAKE THIS CLASS! I hear it's better than the econometrics classes, and this covers much of the same things.\r\n\r\nHonestly, if you want to go into the social sciences, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is a must! Especially because of Prof. Thomas. He literally is the reason why this class is so amazing. He spends the time to make sure that you learn it; he's a great professor, but he also makes the class interesting. I know you may not believe me when I say that he makes stats interesting, but literally, this is probably the best that a stats class could ever be.
