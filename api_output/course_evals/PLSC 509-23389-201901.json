I found it useful in thinking about the foundational assumptions of social science research, particularly in light of recent methodological debates in political science. "

Some additional context, maybe at the end of class so the students would have understand the readings for next week, would have been helpful.\r\nAdditionally, the Wikipedia assignments, though a fun idea, seemed untethered from the classroom discussion and involved too much busy work (so much training) to make it worthwhile. Some of the students were unmotivated for the assignment and I spent weeks waiting for feedback from a colleague that never came. "

That's something that's important to me and I'm glad I took the course, but for others who are less invested in those debates, the theory and philosophy might be a lot to wade through. "
