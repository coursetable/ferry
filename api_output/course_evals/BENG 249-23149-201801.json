            "\u00a0I think a strength was the content of the course because it was very interesting. However, the lectures were very dry and definitely should have been more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty poorly taught. Not engaging as we only sat in class and stared at code that Prof Mak typed up at a million miles an hour. Material is interesting, though. Cool psets but you better be on top of your coding/logic skills. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0The course content was definitely strong, and we got a lot of good advice and help from the TAs. I would say, however, that the teaching could have been far more effective with a bit more of a personable and accessible attitude as well as some changes to teaching style that started to happen near the end of the semester. For example, for most of the course, we essentially watched the professor code long functions that were often very repetitive, so that there were minimal explanations of new concepts, yet we still wasted time on repeating certain simplistic sections of code. To fix this, I would simply give the students code in advance, and spend class time explaining the logic behind each line of code. In addition, a slightly more personable attitude would have helped make the class a little more engaging for students during lecture, rather than only when doing problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not too fast passed and did a good job of focusing on the basics before building into more complicated examples. ",
            "\u00a0The class is generally poorly taught. Professor Mak is definitely extremely smart but is quite terrible at teaching. He types codes so fast, and we can't keep up with him. He does not give a lot of background on the significance of the codes and assumes a lot of our abilities when most students ideally come into the class with no background in coding. I think this class should be taught very differently. The codes should be posted before lecture, and Prof Mak should comment in his code so we don't get lost trying to understand it. We evaluated the course before the spring break but there was no significant change after. TA sections should be after Wednesday when the psets are posted so we can get the chance to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good intro to matlab but I think people should take stats before taking this course? Also a lot of matlab functions went unexplained ",
            "\u00a0The course tried to teach several different topics at once and was not very cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0The course is clear about what it expects you to be able to do, but lectures could be made more engaging to facilitate direct application of these skills. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: the math component of the course is sometimes assumed to be known, or explained in a white board. I wish that the math component and the meaaning of some codes were explained more in class, like the why to use a certain code or loop. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course tried to squeeze too much in so ended up feeling rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The professor of this course was not good. He was not engaging with the class, was very monotone, and didn't show much effort into our work. ",
            "\u00a0lectures are quite boring, could be more interactive. \r\nI also think final project could be used to replace the final exam, because, after all when you need to program for research or other purposes, it's not how fast you can make the program, but how close the simulation is to real life, or how clever the design is. \r\n\r\nI feel like the final exam is just regurgitation of things that Prof Mak talked about in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: presents a decent overview of the MATLAB skills that are necessary for a biomedical engineering major.   Codes are posted online, which helps if yours wasn't working in class for an unknown reason.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  the class material is presented in the most boring way imaginable.  Also, questions asked in class are frequently not answered well. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It is definitely very interesting and challenging. Exactly what a Yale course should be. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn matlab, take it. If you are BME, you need to take it. Otherwise, don't take it. Don't expect to have a good time, but expect to become rather proficient in basic simulations. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this course if you are a prospective Biomedical Engineering major who needs the requirement and has an interest in using Matlab for computation and simulations. It would not be a great course for someone who was not already interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course is you are majoring in biomedical engineering. ",
            "\u00a0Nope, I ideally would not recommend this class, unless you absolutely have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Its for the major so take it I guess ",
            "\u00a0I would if you're a bme student because it's for the most part manageable. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course unless it was a requirement for your major. It is not well taught, the professor is not very good at engaging the students and expects you to know how to do everything even when the students had never seen the information before. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class ( although, I know it's not particularly enjoyable for a lot of people), for a few reasons. I had a bit programming background beforehand ( like I know what iteration and recursion are, but that's about it), and that makes me life slightly easier. \r\n\r\n1. It's a useful class. MatLab is a language used frequently in research ( the postdoc in my lab literally uses it everyday, but it also depends on the work you do ofc) 2. It's a nice intro to biological computations and biological simulation, because the models are basic and easy. It opens you to another way of thinking biological systems.   3. This class is nicely structured. Four units, 6 lectures per unit. Can't be clearer than that. The materials are nicely organized, and TAs and Prof Mak are helpful ( you gotta seek out for resources. Prof Mak might seem nonchalant (might be true) ,but he knows what he is talking about ( compare to some other class, in which the prof doesn't know his or her own stuff)). \r\n\r\nSo take it if you are BME, get some programming background for yourself beforehand, and enjoy the class. If you are not BME and you just want to take a CS class that's somehow bio-related, don't take this class, cuz its modeling is not that eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0It's alright if you're looking to learn how to use MATLAB (or if you need it for the BME major).  And the material is learnable if you listen in class and look over the posted codes and do the psets - it's just SO boring, and the instructor is extremely unengaging and monotone. "
