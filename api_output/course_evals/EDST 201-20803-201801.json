            "\u00a0I thought the material and topics covered were very interesting, but the material was sometimes overly quantitative. Also, professor Altonji has done some amazing work and was good at answering questions, but sometimes his presentations were unorganized and confusing. "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this to students who are Econ majors AND deeply passionately about the material. This course is moreso econometrics applied to education. ",
            "\u00a0This class deals with interesting topics if you are excited about education. However, it is pretty quantitative and much of the class is spent looking at papers and evaluating casualty in studies, which can be dry at times. If you are an econ major, this class won't be too difficult, but some of the regression techniques may be hard to understand if you haven't taken econometrics. Professor Altonji has done a lot of pioneering research on education and is very knowledgeable, so I would recommend this class if you want to learn what recent economics research has taught us about education and you are willing to put in work to understand the foundational elements of the studies.
