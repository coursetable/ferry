            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, the readings were incredibly interesting and the topic of post-truth is relevant to current affairs which makes it useful for analyzing what happens in the news. Since the theory in the class was not strictly anthropology, this course would be great for non-anthropology majors as well. "
