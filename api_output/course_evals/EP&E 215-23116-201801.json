            "\u00a0Learned immensely about 7 important figures in EP&Etheir theories, backgrounds, and inherent tensions/faults.  Learned methods of academic inquiry into dense political thought.  Learned how to formulate and back up comments on these theories. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-EP&E major, I was for the first time exposed to how ethics, politics, and economics interact in theory and in history, as well as to the implications of their interaction on society. We read Hume, Ferguson, Schumpeter, Aristotle, and more, and compared and contrasted their theories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to understand and analyze philosophical texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about ancient and modern political thought in this course, as well as how to comparatively assess different thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I got a good overview of classical philosophy, as well as how the relationship between ethics, politics, and economics works. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Boris, Boris, Boris!  This class is that intense, engaging Yale seminar you always dreamed of.  Professor Kapustin's engagement with the material is unrivaled; he's intense, passionate, and respectfully in his own lane.  I cannot recommend HIS section of this course enough!  Everything related to him in class is sterling.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Essays will sneak up on you and little guidance is provided before their due date.  Still, this is a particular critique and it's hard to find fault with this amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Kapustin is a fantastic lecturer, dynamic, passionate, and able to instill the importance of the topics we discuss\r\nWeaknesses- Would love to see more application of the theories ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was a solid overview of many philosophical authors  students got a broad swath of a variety of texts. But at the same time, I wish we could have spent more time on each text. It would have better allowed students to understand the historical and philosophical context of each author that we were dissecting. ",
            "\u00a0There are basically no weaknesses. The class is engaging, stimulating, and extremely beneficial because Professor Kapustin is an excellent lecturer. "

            "\u00a0Eye-opening course, especially for a STEM major like myself! I was for the first time exposed to how ethics, politics, and economics interact in theory and in history, as well as to the implications of their interaction on society. Especially in the second semester of my senior year, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to take a seminar with Professor Kapustin, whose reputation is legendary. Lots of dense, thought provoking readings, a midterm and a final essay besides that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  it provides a great foundation in ethics, politics and economics, and I used the knowledge in other classes as well. The papers are super interesting, and Kapustin makes the class very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You will learn a ton and be intellectually stimulated throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, as Professor Kapustin's seminars are extremely enriching and fascinating. I learned so much from his extremely knowledgeable and passionate discussion and deep analysis of the philosophers we read and came out of this class understanding all of the philosophers on a much deeper level.
