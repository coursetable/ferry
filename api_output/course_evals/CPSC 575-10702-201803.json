            "\u00a0It covered a lot of different concepts, and the student's level of interest really dictates how much they will learn from the class. That means that a motivated student can walk away with a fairly robust understanding of a number of computational vision techniques. cons -- it was a little scattered, especially since it covered so many topics, and the tests were not very representative of the core technical course material. \r\n\r\nTests could be adjusted to be more representative of lecture. Currently they're fairly easy, but not what you would study from the online notes or lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0One strength would be that Prof. Zucker's lecture is very engaging (he seems to have a lot of jokes prepared for the subject matter of each lecture). Another strength is that the homework is well-designed, and really helps the learning process. \r\n\r\nOne weakness would be that Prof. Zucker's handwriting on the blackboard is sometimes hard to read. Although lecture notes are uploaded in the form of chapters from the textbook, I hope concise version of printed notes can be provided. That would make it easier to study for exams. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend because this course introduces me to a whole new wonderful area of computer science (in a beautifully presented way). Although the lectures can be hard to follow sometimes since I have not done anything related to computer vision before, the lectures are well-structured and homework sets are well-designed. As a result, the learning process is quite pleasant. And besides all that, the computer vision area is wonderful in that you can see how beautiful mathematics is. ",

The topics being taught in this course are different from what we usually learn from all other courses, but yet related and useful. You feel highly engaged and motivated to learn in this course. ",
