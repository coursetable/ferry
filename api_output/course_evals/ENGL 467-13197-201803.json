            "\u00a0Everything you need to be a good journalist. Anyone with a remote interest in journalism is lucky that Brill started the YJI. ",
            "\u00a0I learned reporting skills, a bit about the business of journalism, and the value of brevity. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to think critically about the ethical dimensions of journalism and some basic reporting and writing skills were reinforced. I think that the readings assigned were some of the most interesting parts of the course, but they were not really discussed in class. One of the redeeming aspects of the course were opportunities to discuss the ways that the journalism world is changing. ",
            "\u00a0The basic skills and ethical conduct of journalism \r\nTwo assignments that could put those knowledge to use ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the practice, business, and ethics of journalism. I learned how to source extensively and prepare myself for long term journalism projects. I learned how to incorporate feedback into my work to improve my drafts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings were actually interesting and very practical (I found them especially helpful since I'm currently writing on a beat right now and so many of them were applicable to the work I regularly do), which I haven't found to be the case with most courses at Yale. We got a lot of practical journalism advice, and we got to meet Bob Woodward, which was very cool. Weaknesses: We often didn't discuss the aforementioned great readings in class, and Prof. Brill would kind of just lecture at us and occasionally cold-call someone. He is also kind of mean over email, and he has this whole shtick where he stresses paranoia and only gives negative feedback (at least in writing). Personally, I work and learn much better when I know what I'm doing well in addition to what I'm doing badly, and Brill only really ever told me what I did badly until I got the final draft of my story back. I was really surprised when I got it back and his comments were overwhelmingly positive and he gave me a good grade. I get the sense that he was trying to scare us into doing good work, which I guess is a valid approach, but isn't one that I took well to. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think that Brill's teaching style is effective or sometimes, helpful. I would characterize the course in its current state as a bunch of tips Brill wants young journalists to know. His seminar style is basically cold-calling people looking for a right answer.  The course does a decent job connecting students to journalists in the world and giving them an opportunity to pursue longer features. I don't think, however, that the feedback received during the class' two writing assignments was very helpful. (The assignments were well-designed, though.) ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course! Everyone considering going into journalism should take the class. Professor Brill also genuinely cares about the students in the seminar and is always willing to provide journalism/career advice. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course does an excellent job of exposing students to real world practices of journalism. I think that the course might improve with more group projects, or more small writing assignments. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student--if they are lucky enough to get in. There is no professor that I've ever had at Yale that cares about the success of his students as much as Steven Brill. Just note that Brill's teaching style isn't for the faint of heart! And please give him the benefit of the doubt. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student with little exposure to journalism and its standards. Of course, these are the students who do not usually get into classes like ENGL 467 because of application skews.  I would also recommend this course to students planning on spending summers or more working at a journalistic outlet. The opportunity to be a journalism scholar is nice, but mainly for the funding and for the resume boost. For students with more experience, it seems to be something to do for the sake of doing it, not necessarily because you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, but I might be a little biased because I definitely want to go into journalism. Having said that, both students pursuing a career in journalism and those new to the field should take the course. You read great stories and books in this class. Professor Brill really cares about his students and is always willing to offer help in anything. He's one of the most accessible professors I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this course. I talk about it all the time, and I think my loved ones are annoyed. This course was such a great departure from the regular Yale class, which I think of as very abstract and intellectual (which has its place, but I wanted some more practical experience). I felt like I was gaining concrete skills, as if I were at a trade school. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it teaches you how to approach journalism with discipline, work ethic, and curiosity. "
