            "\u00a0I learned about various factors that play into the development, maintenance, and treatment of addiction. We read interesting and diverse perspectives on a number of issues related to the field of addiction, and were tasked with thinking critically about these issues and preparing positions for debates. We also gained more clarity about addictive behavior through our own behavior changes, which helped us to experience craving, withdrawal, and other struggles faced by addicted individuals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the science of addiction, as well as how to think critically about psychological research related to the topic. I thought the debate weeks were especially conducive to considering both sides of an argument and realizing how research can be found or framed to support either side of a debate. This was a super valuable course for me, as I didn't know that much about this important topic before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the neurobiology of addiction, the social structures in the United States that worsen addiction issues, addiction in the criminal justice system, and the efficacy of different treatments for addiction. ",
            "\u00a0Learned some valuable info about addictions and treatment. It was a lot of neuroscience based research and I learned how debates can be beneficial in expanding or changing my view. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the biological mechanisms behind addiction and all of addictions social implications. Throughout this class I learned a lot bout the symptoms of this disease and also how to treat it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to contextualize current research in neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science within larger perspectives (justice, racism, etc.) for addictions. I also learned about current questions/issues debated in the field of addiction. Most importantly, I learned to craft original arguments supported by existing research and to be critical of overinterpreting studies and over-relying on statistics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to incorporate new addiction research into debates around the nature of addiction. I learned how to read scientific studies critically and synthesize the information from multiple sources to develop a more cohesive picture of the state of research. "

            "\u00a0There were a ton of strengths! The readings were beneficial, and the lectures were amazing. I learned so much each week. Prof. Baskin Sommers is one of the most organized instructors I've ever had, and she's great at facilitating productive discussions. Every reading we did and every lecture slide was important to us getting a better understanding of addiction. I gained a deeper understanding of the complexity of the topic. This was one of the best classes I've taken as a psych major at Yale. \r\n\r\nI thought the debate portion of the class was useful for realizing how complicated policy issues surrounding addiction can be, but I think that we got bogged down in defending our side rather than learning all we can about the topic. In the future, maybe it would be beneficial to have us prepare opening statements to support our side to appreciate how research can be found to support any opinion, but then after that opening portion, maybe there should just be general discussion rather than point-counterpoint debate. I found it contrived to defend a particular side when the overarching subject was so complex. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful and really engaging.  I loved the format.  We spent the first part of the semester in a relaxed lecture where we could ask questions and comment on the material.  For the second half of the semester, we were divided into different groups for debates about addiction.  I think the debates really forced me to see both sides of complicated issues and to use critical thinking skills to engage with my peers' ideas.  Some of the strengths of this course were the interesting material and the amazing, dedicated professor.  The only improvement I can suggest would be having the professor give us more of her opinion at the end of the debates. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly responses to the readings very good. They were exceptionally helpful for debate weeks so I knew if I had a good idea or needed to develop it more in time for the debate. I also enjoyed the behavior change and it was cool tracking behavior over a semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course, and I loved how it was organized. The first half of the course was devoted to lectures learning the material and the second half was devoted to important debates of topics surrounding addiction. It was a very engaging class and I had a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: challenges you to think independently and critically, focus on current topics and research, EXTREMELY well organized and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: not really sure if the debates were really making us debate. I liked how we could prepare ahead of time but sometimes that might have been made discussion a little harder because I would prepare a lot for my one slide but my questions would be more general for the opposing side. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Baskin-Sommers does a great job of selecting readings and structuring the course. The mix of experiential learning in the behavior change and academic work with the scientific literature was excellent. I felt like the research for the debates in the second half of the course was helpful for deepening my understanding of the material, but that the debates themselves were not very debate-like. We didn't really get to react to one another's positions or deepen our discussion, each student just read out a pre-prepared short speech. Maybe a vibrant debate requires a smaller class. I found the debates somewhat frustrating and would've liked a little more of a blend of high level discussion about addiction with the minutiae that we explored in the scientific literature. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, especially if you don't know that much about addiction. Amazing discussions, and you'll learn so much. The professor is amazing, and the amount of work is reasonable and graded fairly. You'll always know how you're doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - super interesting; actually learned a lot and was given the chance to think about concepts for myself; excellent, funny, engaging, helpful professor! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!  Professor Baskin-Sommers is the best psychology professor at Yale.  The class is demanding but fair and you will learn a lot.  Addiction is also a really important issue in the world today and this is a great opportunity to have a better understanding of its root causes and the most effective treatments. ",
            "\u00a0If you are into neuroscience this is a cool class. It was a little too neuroscience heavy for me, but besides that the topics were very engaging and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The conversations and readings were fascinating, the seminars were fun, and the professor was great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's different in that you have to think on a \"vertical\" level, pulling together lots of information from different fields and levels of thinking. Essentially grouping your thinking by a central theme (addiction) rather than a specific area (neuroscience, cognition, justice, etc). I think this allows for a fuller picture of the topic beyond just getting a lecture in class about different sides to the same story/question. This course will teach you to think critically and to be critical of research and the directions it takes (not in a pessimistic way). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Excellent course on addiction. Worth taking if you're at all interested in multifactorial diseases. "
