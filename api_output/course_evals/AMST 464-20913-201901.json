            "\u00a0Strengths include flexibility, low time commitment and exposure to new films. Weaknesses include the discrepancy in knowledge between the professor and other teaching assistants. There didn't seem to be continuity between both instructors, making it hard to expect consistent help on the same topic. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that you have a whole year to do a project, so it is very easy to do nothing until the very end. I do not recommend this, but it is how many people approach the course. I think it could be improved if there were more rigid deadlines throughout the term. Also, I was talking to some of the other people in the class and we thought it would be great if we actually started showing early versions of our work earlier in the year. We didn't start seeing each other's footage until the last couple weeks of the year. There should be viewings early on! "

            "\u00a0If you're highly self-motivated / have a good idea of what  documentary you want to create- take this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a very structured experience where you learn how to make a documentary film (i.e. if you have never done filmmaking before), don't take this course unless you're a serious self-starter--there's a better option for you! Take Intro Documentary Filmmaking with Sandra Luckow in the art school--she will really get you started, and you will learn basic skills. Also, if you don't have a specific project idea, don't take this course. It's really designed for people who are self-motivated to make their own documentary and already have a project idea going in. That being said, if you already know some basic filmmaking/have already taken Sandra's class and do have a project idea, this is a good option for you! Charlie Musser and John Lucas will make themselves available to you for any help or advice you need. Just beware that you should push yourself not to leave everything till the end. "
