            "\u00a0Learned a lot about how suspense is used to propel the plot of a novel. Great discussions as to how points of view, pacing, and senses all contribute to the reader's feeling of suspense. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about suspense fiction and the elements of suspense that are required to build this genre. I was able to develop greater insight into how to truly read novels and other works via the heavy discussion part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0It has been a while since I have written or talked in such a small setting so the course really helped me learn how to better express my ideas and give insightful ideas. I learned a lot about how suspense in general works and the course made me realize its importance in narrative. ",
            "\u00a0This course not only taught me how to identify and evaluate literature but also how to read it. Professor Eccles taught our seminar how to search through novels, and be the detective in finding how authors encapsulate readers and formulate their arguments. Additionally, Professor Eccles unique supplemental material to course novels opens students eyes to a more expansive area of thought extending from suspense narrative. Her use of film brought suspsebsw from the pages to the screen, allowing students to explore the genre in a different medium. The reading responses were a helpful area of the course to learn how to write about the novels read and prepare ideas for the midterm and final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and everything about it. The books we read were interesting and captivating and the range of materials we studied was extensive. Our discussions were then always intriguing and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to hold my own to some extent in a college-level seminar discussion. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought the discussions were interesting and the pacing of the course was perfect. It was an interesting course and the majority of the readings were enjoyable. Weakness: sometimes you do a lot of reading for a class but only get to discuss a small portion of it which is slightly discouraging at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that you are truly able to learn a lot just by discussing works with your peers and Professor Eccles. You really feel like you're not in class but just having conversation with others about a book. A weakness would be that some of the works are unnecessarily long and don't attribute as much to the overall class. I'd cut back some of the heavy reading load if possible and maybe discuss suspense in other mediums (film, TV) as well. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the material of the course. All the books read were interesting and engaging and I liked that we expanded our ideas about suspense to films at the end of class. It was just a very nice environment to say anything I wanted. In terms of weaknesses, perhaps the course can be better structured with more handouts or definite notes. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers students an excellent introduction to reading and writing about literature and analyzing social critiques through the centuries, focusing how the genre of suspense literature has transformed and remained over time. The creative atmosphere Professor Eccles fostered was a key asset in absorbing her brilliant hypothesis and formulating your own. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only thing I could think of would be to read a couple more modern novels. In addition, there is a lot of modern television and movies that I think the professor could include or if there is another movie based on a book we could read, I think we really benefitted from reading suspense and then experiencing it through film. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very compelling collection of readings and movies. And the discussions always ended up really well. However, maybe there should be more discussion about suspense specifically. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was enjoyable and engaging. The readings were almost always fun to do, and I could do them as a way to take a break from another class. Furthermore, the discussions were incredibly interesting. 10/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're a student who enjoys the nuances of writing and genre fiction, I'd recommend this class for you. You truly learn a lot and see things in works that you probably didn't notice before. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student; especially incoming freshman because this seminar in my opinion really helps you build a solid foundation for analyzing text which is necessary for other classes you may want to take. The class was the perfect level of difficulty so that I was able to transition nicely from high school to college writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It transformed the way I view literature and the humanities in general (as I am a STEM student!). Not only did it teach me how to write, but it also pushed me to evaluate certain social matters and how my opinions on such matters changes/solidifies through the literature read. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are at all interested in suspense as a genre. The material we worked with was fascinating and our discussions and analysis of the material was deep and insightful. In addition, Professor Eccles is one of the sweetest, most personable, interesting professors I have ever had. She was so passionate about suspense and about helping us understand and be interested in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, it was a very good selection of content. "
