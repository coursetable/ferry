            "\u00a0I learned how to read a wide breadth of primary scientific literature (and reviews) within the field of genomics. I left with a much better understanding of the statistical basis of a lot of the main genomic studies today, and definitely prepared to engage with this literature independently in my future studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned valuable skills in reading and interpreting very complex scientific research publications. This skills are extremely valuable and I have been able to utilize them in many areas of my academic and extracurricular life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the recent research/papers in the human genetics field. I also better honed in my ability to read, analyze, and critique scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the ability to engage with primary literature, take away things that would be useful for my own research, and the understand the importance of the field in general for medicine. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read and interpret papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course about how to read higher level genomics papers! Everything was truly so interesting and I really felt like I gained useful skills by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great upper level bio course to take! I learned so much about how to read scientific papers effectively and how to get the key info from it every time! The class size is small and a lot of people usually sign up, but definitely worth a try get it. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about current techniques and areas of study in genetics research, more proficiency in reading genetics literature, interpreting graphs, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course allows you to painlessly learn how to dig through many of the (initially confusing) graphs in stats in some of the most influential papers in genomics today. By going over 1-2 papers a week, presenting on an assigned paper, and introducing a new paper in class, you become fluent in the science of genomics. I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the field!! ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed the set up and execution of the course. Dellaporta is very thoughtful with his paper choices and is very open to feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the seminar format. It felt like everyone could contribute or ask questions any time. Professor Dellaporta was very approachable and willing to answer any and all questions. I thought that the last few topics on the human microbiome, neanderthal DNA and migration were fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course is that it get directly into the primary literature, reading papers and discussing them in class. A weakness of the course is the fact that perhaps some of the time in the course is spent on figuring out technical details and other things rather than on the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dellaporta is very amiable and invested in students' experiences, and the workload is quite low ",
            "\u00a0A great class overall. The papers were all quite interesting, and Professor Dellaporta was good at leading discussions. I felt like I was really encouraged to not only understand the results of each paper but also to more closely scrutinize the methods and validity of conclusions. Participation in the class was really high, so our discussions felt really engaging. "

            "\u00a0Yes yes yes yes!! This is an AMAZING upper level MCDB seminar that will allow you to better engage with literature in genomics in the future and introduce you to the different sub-fields within the field. The workload is very fair, and you get so much out of it by the end. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A great high-level biology course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. If an MCDB student enjoyed genetics, then this would be a great class for them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I would say as a senior who has had experience with other MCDB courses at Yale, this is a good course to finish up your Yale experience. It is relatively low workload and allows you to read interesting papers in a field that is very important at the moment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course is very laid-back and gives useful long-term skills with interpreting papers ",
            "\u00a0This is a great upper-level course for MCDB majors. Low workload--only reading papers each week and presenting one paper. Dellaporta is a great professor and was encouraging throughout the semester. The content is pretty interesting if you can get past the initial barrier of the complexity of some of the papers. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a very low workload--you get assigned about two papers to read every week, but as they can sometimes be pretty complex, they can take a while to fully understand, but since this is the main work, you can dedicate the time to it. You really do learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this class if you have the opportunity. I started the class incredibly confused by the first paper we had to read and looking up every other word and left the class with a much greater knowledge of common genetics research techniques and ability to read genetics papers. Professor Dellaporta is great at teaching the class he and our TA were both great at explaining confusing concepts and at asking questions to guide the discussion that went beyond just stating the results of the papers, but forced us to really examine why things were done (and whether that seemed sufficient to draw certain conclusions). The workload isn't huge (about 2 papers a week), but I felt like I gained a lot from the class. "
