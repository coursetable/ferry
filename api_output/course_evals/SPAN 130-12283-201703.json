            "\u00a0This class forces you to begin speaking Spanish fluently because of the daily exposure to the language. Besides orally, the class focuses on grammar and vocabulary. Its readings also touch upon Spanish culture. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I interacted with Spanish culture in a new way--the instructor incorporated some art, music, literature, films, short films, or current news into class each day, and this made the class very interesting because you were learning more than just how to speak the language.  I believe that my level of fluency with creating and understanding while speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish grew astronomically.  The class was designed to incorporate these skills each day, and having the class taught entirely in Spanish also bettered my listening.  For the first time, I felt as though I was able to convey my personality and voice while speaking and writing in another language, rather than feeling as though I am just dryly repeating facts or quotes.  My instructor always provided prompt, precise, detailed feedback which caught many mistakes and helped me to become a more precise writer in Spanish.  I now feel very engaged with the language and find myself wanting to speak in Spanish more often.  I am looking forward to Level 4. ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly improved my speaking abilities. I already knew most of the grammar, but I had never practiced speaking in Spanish with such consistency in high school. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish really developed in this clas especially the grammar. It also helped me use and apply my Spanish in real word situations and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish writing, speaking, culture, and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking skills developed a lot. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved a huge amount through this course. My knowledge greatly increased (knowledge of verb tenses, vocab, and many other important aspects of grammar). My listening also improved, but I think the biggest improvement was my speech. I got better at speaking quickly and not having to think as much about what I was saying, it just came naturally and I felt more comfortable. My reading also improved by reading the stories. ",
            "\u00a0130 drastically improved my Spanish speaking skills. I enjoyed learning more of the nuances of Spanish grammar, but the greatest impact of the class was a deeper immersion in the language itself which helped a great deal with listening and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved greatly. I improved my speaking, grammar, writing, and vocabulary. "

            "\u00a0Its strengths are the daily exposure to the language and the grammar homework improve your Spanish skills. However, towards the end of class, class diverged by giving a novelita and movie which did not prepare students for the grammar intensive final test. Also, the practice tests given before exams and quizzes were misleading for the actual exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well thought-out and fair.  Homework varies in weight each night but is usually helpful to reaffirm what was learned in class that day / what will be learned in class the next day, and the use of the textbook online with the Supersite is also great.  The massive incorporation of Spanish culture into everyday class makes the class much more relatable and interesting--you are certainly not just doing grammar and vocabulary exercises each day in class / each night for homework.  The textbook is laid out well, and you can also use the same textbook for L4!  You will definitely be well-prepared for tests and quizzes as long as you keep up with nightly homework and readings and study before the exam.  There are some in-class writing assignments as well.  Overall, I nearly always felt like the exams and prompts were fair and that I had enough time to complete them to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nIn regards to improvements, I wish that we practiced more of the vocabulary in class.  Many times I had to spend hours studying the vocabulary because it was always tested on exams and quizzes, but we hardly ever mentioned half of the vocabulary which we were expected to know on a given exam in class unless it came up in someone's answer to a question.  Also, one of my high school Spanish teachers instituted a method where you would raise your hand anytime you didn't understand something that was said.  Her course, too, was conducted completely in Spanish, and she always said that the class is not helping you grow as a Spanish speaker/listener at all if you are not understanding what is being said.  I think that something similar could be incorporated into Yale's Spanish classrooms.  It would not take up much class time, but it would certainly help students gain a broader vocabulary and comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0Too repetitive, not enough focus on actual grammar and vocabulary instruction. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was how organized and intensive it was. There was no topic that we took a cursory class at but instead our homework, class work, and group work was made to better understand the concepts. The activities like the retelling of a news story was difficult but helped push my Spanish. I cannot think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was an all-around good course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: conversational activities with partners, lots of practice speaking \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grammar lessons ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how well laid out the course was, and how there were never any surprises with the schedule. I also think that the course was able to cover a huge amount of material. I really feel like I learned a lot, but was not overworked either. Sometimes I felt like the grammar could have been covered a little more in class, because sometimes we would only do one or two activities with a concept and I didn't feel like I had a grasp of it yet, but it all ended up fine. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the amount of speaking in Spanish we did. I was a big fan of all of the activities that allowed us to converse in Spanish and work on our speaking skills. A big weakness of the class was that we never really learned the new material in the class itself. Some days we would review the material, but we were almost never lectured on it. The class could be improved by replacing many of the cultural activities with actual teaching of the material. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it truly improves your Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely feel more comfortable speaking and writing in Spanish ",
            "\u00a0This course will most likely be your best experience with Spanish yet!  I was never bored in class because it incorporated so much music, art, literature, film, etc.  I learned a lot about Spanish culture and was pushed to teach others when we had to present a synopsis of a Spanish news article.  There certainly were challenges along the way, but I think I have grown more as a Spanish speaker/listener/reader/writer over the past semester than I had throughout seven prior years of taking Spanish.  I feel very engaged with the language now and am inspired to pursue a higher level of fluency with Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course simply because of how much it improved my confidence to speak in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this class. Even if you are taking it for a credit it is a fun and effective way to learn Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoy Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if someone wants to learn Spanish. It is extremely helpful and I learned a ton, my Spanish has greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0If a student has to take L3, I would recommend taking a summer trip to Spain to complete L3 and L4. I feel that learning a language is best done in a full immersion experience. It is not that L3 was a bad course, it is more that a student has a limited amount of classes at Yale and the language requirement could be best completed over the summer. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my Spanish and enjoyed the format of the class. It is comforting in its routine and the assignments are simple yet helpful. "
