            "\u00a0Tracy was a great section leader.  She made everyone comfortable in part by sharing of herself and her own experiences as a minister, and she also made sure each person was comfortable at their own level of Supervised MInistry-related maturity - no matter where they were on their spiritual journey, no matter what their work abilities.  She was non judgmental but provided great guidance at the same time.  I only have great things to say about her. ",

            "\u00a0Alison Cunningham is an excellent section leader. She encourages individual reflection and participation. Her section drew out the differences in our supervised ministry sites, and offered reflection on how to manage each of our challenges. She was excellent at enabling us to come together as a group, notwithstanding differences in our faith traditions or callings to ministry. ",

            "\u00a0Alison was wonderful. She was really good at creating an environment that was really relaxing and easy without making it a meaningless group. She did a great job of making sure everyone was, kindly, challenged to show up, but did not push anyone uncomfortably. She did a really good job at challenging us to think theologically and corporately and critically about our experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Very caring, lots of experience, great demeanor ",
            "\u00a0Alison was amazing. She really made the space a useful one for me. I didn't really find the curriculum to be helpful. I was told that the course has not supposed to be 'academic', but the listed readings made it feel that way. I found the space to be most helpful in that in facilitated reflection on my internship experiences. That happened in the practicum, not as a result of readings. Alison's skillful facilitation of the group was the main reason this course was helpful. ",
