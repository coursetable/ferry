Sometimes working together with a lazy teammate might be frustrating. The percentage for the Assignment 1b Project Proposal is high, so maybe a heads-up before the assignment might be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the assignments and lectures are very organized by themselves. \r\nIt could be improved if the assignments could be tied to the lecture in progress; and if there can be few late days/ extensions for the assignment. The assignments usually have a very tight timing. \r\n\r\nAlso the quiz in class sometimes doesnt reflect the true status of whether the students do the reading. The single/ multiple choices questions were a bit confusing. ",
