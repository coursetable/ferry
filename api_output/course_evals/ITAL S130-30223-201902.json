            "\u00a0I learned to speak, read, and write Italian at a much higher level, with more sophistication and fluidity than when I started. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the duration of the course, I acquired a vast amount of knowledge and drastically improved my ability to communicate, understand, pronounce, and read in Italian. I also had the opportunity to engage with several materials and strategies to help me remember the material more easily and effectively. I fully emerged myself in the course and along with the opportunity to practice outside of class, I was able to supplement my learning and practice continuously. I also learned how to write in Italian given a specific prompt and realize the mistakes I made while gradually improving. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths-engaging, we improved and spoke a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-we could have done more worksheets to nail down the grammar concepts ",
            "\u00a0Please see response for L4 ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how the course was set up. I particularly liked when the class was divided in two because we could get even more practice time. \r\nI also really liked all of the planned excursions to different cities! ",
            "\u00a0The grammar lessons and conversation parts of class were great! ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of keeping every student engaged with a variety of assignments, the best of which included daily discussions and individual presentations to engage in constant practice of the language. The professors also provided thorough feedback on written assignments that were completed weekly throughout the course, which was very helpful towards honing the understanding of the written language. Sometimes, however, the difficulty of the course and its formal assessments turned my focus too much towards the formalism of the language and how memorizing rules and terms would get me ahead on the assessment, instead of continuing to inspire my natural love of the language through a better understanding of the \"feel\" of the use and grammar of the language. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely has a lot of strengths beginning with the fact that it takes place in Italy, which in itself already provides a huge advantage and opportunity to immerse oneself fully into learning and applying the language on a constant basis. The main strength of the course is the diverse types of assignments that are given that allow us to practice Italian which ranged from daily homework exercises, online homework, compositions and more. Furthermore, the professors offered different learning styles that complemented each other and offered a different approach to the material. The only weakness I found with the course was that not much information was given beforehand and especially during the first week the pace picked up rather quickly. I feel as though not enough time was spent on the basics because there was the assumption we remembered everything, but besides that the pace was good and I really enjoyed this part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0There were inconsistencies between the two professors, which resulted in confusion and unpredictability throughout the whole course. ",
            "\u00a0The conversational practices at the start of every lesson greatly helped push me to start thinking in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses - course was very engaging and informative ",
            "\u00a0Poor planning, professors occasionally confrontational. Strengths: learned a lot, class discussions ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the way in which the professors handled class participation as it forced me to actually pay attention and be engaged during class hours. I enjoyed talking exercises but I felt like they were sometimes too long when we had to hear each person speak. I think that the midterm oral evaluation about our trip to Rome was not very useful, as we had to listen to everyone repeat pretty similar stories and it was very long. The workbook was useful and I enjoyed the format of the class itself. The midterm was difficult and we also never received clear feedback or grades for our final presentations. "

            "\u00a0yes, overall I really enjoyed it ",
            "\u00a0Please see response for L4 ",
            "\u00a0Of course! This was one of my favorite summers! You learn so much of the language while being fully immersed in the culture. I absolutely loved the classes and the home-stay! I would recommend this program to everyone wanting to learn Italian while also having such a fun summer. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great experience! Would recommend ",
            "\u00a0I would warn another student that this is a tough course, with a high density of assignments and stringent expectations for tests and assessments that will make the language feel exceptionally frustrating at points. With that said, by the time one is finished with the course, they will have grown an incredible amount in their fluency and sophistication for the language, and will be all the better off for it; it's surprising how much growth the students accrued over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The Yale Summer Abroad in Siena program was the best experience I've had during my time at Yale so far and I learned a lot more than I had during a whole year of Italian at Yale. The immersion of being in Italy makes all the difference because it compliments what is learned in the classroom drastically. Besides that, the amount of material covered in this half of the course provides the basics to be able to navigate Italy just fine and the variety of assignments and resources provided give plenty of opportunities to practice and truly understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you would like to improve your ability to communicate in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  - very interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Go to Siena!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very fun and engaging way to learn the language. ",
            "\u00a0No. The first half was good, really good. By the second half it seemed like the professors were done with the course. They became confrontational and felt more like enemies instead of the friends they were in the first half. It's.not that the class became difficult, just not enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great course for someone interested in learning Italian, and particularly being immersed in the country and culture. "
