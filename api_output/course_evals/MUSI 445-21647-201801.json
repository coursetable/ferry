            "\u00a0Familiarity with a rich body of musical repertoire. A chance to let this body influence my musical citizenship. Interpretive frameworks given by ideological and music-theoretical writings contemporary to the music's time, as well as from our own. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great coverage of where the traditional music history modules stop. I would highly recommend taking this class as a composer especially- learning about the myriad of ways in which composers tackled issues of ingenuity and socio-political pressures is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class with little to no experience with European music from 1950 and left being able to not only talk more intelligently about it but enjoy the music more. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is great! I loved the music we listened to, especially as a conductor looking to gain experience in this music. I liked the relaxed collegial atmosphere of the seminar and the overall vibe of the class was great. In future years it would be nice to get more feedback over the course of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Exposure to this rich repertoire of 20th century music, leading up to our present, should be required for anyone aiming to be a musician in this 21st century. The class provides a survey that'll open up your ears and get your curiosity going. Prof. McCreless is a patient, curious, and open-minded tour guide. So, yes, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. Just being in a seminar room and talking about music with the professor and my classmates was enlightening, even when it was about events or pieces not listed on the syllabus. You will hear varying opinions on the progression of western art music, on pieces, and on composers. And, what's best, you will not be expected to think that a piece is good. This is the course at Yale where I had the most autonomy to say \"this is a bad piece\", if I wanted to in class. \r\n\r\nMusic written after 1950, especially, can get a bad rep - and if you are of the opinion that music stops with serialism, then I would highly recommend this course. It might push the limits of what you think you enjoy audio-acoustically - and it will help contextualise the music you currently love. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. This class is great if you like European orchestral music from 1950 or want to learn about it! It's super engaging and you listen to fantastic music. "
