            "\u00a0This class is a great primer for biology lab work. We learn to prepare bacterial cultures, stain bacterial samples, and conduct/evaluate a variety of tests to characterize and identify microorganisms. For example, staining (gram-stain, negative stain, flagellar stain, simple stain, endospore stain); microscopy (brightfield, phase contrast, for live preps); biochemical tests (LIA, TSI, SIM); plating (on selective and differential media- also for motility, hemolysis assay); genetic identification (DNA extraction, PCR & sequencing). These are broad and useful skills for an aspiring scientist! "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Diversity of Experiments, Workload, \"Fun-ness\" Weaknesses: Not enough theoretical background in lecture for things like staining, microscopy and PCR; ",
            "\u00a0Very little guidance was given by the instructor on lab reports and how to interpret data collected in class. ",
            "\u00a0I like the small lab sections and the personal interactions with the TA. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in the techniques that students learn from the experiments. They are well-designed, fun, and comprehensive- I feel that students really learn a wealth of biology lab techniques and concepts from the experiential programming of this course.\r\n\r\nThat said, this class - as it exists right now - has several alarming weaknesses. For students with very little/no lab experience, the lab are somewhat fast-paced from the start. This would not be an issue, but the instruction is not mindful of the different possible comfort/familiarity-levels of students. Please take this class in a section with a TA who is willing to answer questions/do demos without passing judgement!! \r\n\r\nI also hope that everyone who takes this class in the future knows what demands are made of them for the experiments. Not only is there a throat swab (strep-test style), but also students are asked (without other options or anonymous samples) to provide a rectal sample. Take note!!\r\n\r\nFinally, the lab reports - the only source of scoring besides four very low-stakes quizzes - are all-consuming, deeply frustrating, and graded very harshly. There are four, and they are all clustered within the span of two months-ish in the semester.\r\n\r\nThis lab has great, great potential, and Prof. Dawson should be commended for bringing it back to Yale. After taking this class, however, I would caution students against taking it. With some changes to the experimental schedule and the hiring of thoughtful, teaching-minded TAs, I think that MCDB 291L can be so much more rewarding. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Take this course. It's fun and low stress and Iain Dawson is great. He loves bacteria and by the end of it you'll love them (and him) more. The workload is pretty low, but a bit tail-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0A good bio lab. Professor Dawson is great but your grade is really dependent on which TA you get as they make all the quizzes and grade the lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, one of the better MCDB lab courses offered. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in microbiology. ",
            "\u00a0I think it depends entirely on the student. \r\n\r\nI know that other MCDB labs may be severely over-subscribed, and I think that the Microbiology lab is one of the more accessible (content and enrollment-wise) labs in the major. To fulfill requirements, and to learn a pretty wide & useful set of biology-lab techniques (staining, plating, sampling, biochemical tests, genetic identification), this is a good choice!\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the class has some pretty glaring shortcomings, and students should really be mindful of these before they sign up to take the class. The workload (lab reports) are truly very taxing (demand a lot of labor, only to be graded unfairly, in my view); a few of the experiments are unnecessarily invasive (rectal and throat swabs); and the instruction is not very kind/approachable. For a class that students will spend several hours (plus preparation, plus lab reports) in lab for, this course has ^^ several elements that make it unenjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone looking to take an enjoyable but educational lab. "
