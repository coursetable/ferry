            "\u00a0I think the number of readings we had was a little high since we never got through all of them. I loved the in class discussions though and appreciated the insight given back to us on essays. \r\n\r\nSo, less essays to read and continued feedback and classroom discussions. ",

            "\u00a0I wish we could have had more iterations for each writing assignment. I'm not sure how much more lenient the professor was due to our having less time for each paper compared to students taking the class during the school year. I also wish that we had some more recommended books for formal writing technique, but I acknowledge that each person has their own style. I remember the professor mentioning that we should learn by mimicry and examples since we're novices, so in that regard I wish we had more recommended readings. "

            "\u00a0I think taking it during the summer is a good idea, because you get to focus all of your thoughts outside of work on the writing assignments, which are long but very manageable. \r\nIn general, I recommend English 120 to anyone who wants to get better at writing. You'll also gain more confidence in your writing techniques after dismantling the techniques of other, more accomplished writers. "
