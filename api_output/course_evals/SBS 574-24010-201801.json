            "\u00a0This class is a ton of work that feels not so worthwhile. I think it's valuable to learn the process of creating an intervention, but all the assigned work and detail work feels like a large burden for a one credit course. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the course is that there is a very meaningful and significant output of which I am proud. The actual time spent in class varied in its usefulness \r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n-Allocate fewer lectures to the \"Part 2\" section of the course. This part varies so much by group, and more lectures could be added to the \"Part 3\" section of the course. For those of us who haven't taken Evaluation, this information is new and substantial, and felt rushed. \r\n-Assign 1-2 Teaching Fellows for the course! There was such a long delay in getting feedback from the professor, perhaps due to a larger than usual class size? Having feedback from a teaching fellow more promptly would make a big difference and ultimately result in higher quality outputs. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. Building an intervention from start to finish is a great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I don't have much interest in the subject matter and it was hard to stay engaged. The class would be good for someone very interested in intervention design. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Course provided a clear overview and systematic method for developing a health promotion/disease intervention. \r\n- I really liked the continuity of having three assignments due throughout the semester that would eventually be combined into the final.  Feedback from assignments from both peers and instructor helped a lot with edits for the final manual we submitted.  \r\n- Theatre testing of intervention activities was my favorite portion of the semester -- very active, and also a good way to receive feedback and discuss main concepts behind interventions.  \r\n- I had a really good group, which meant that workload felt very manageable \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- If you are taking this course as a second year, the last two assignments overlapped with thesis deadlines, which did become a little overwhelming.  For future students taking this course, just be sure to keep this in mind when managing time/schedules. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good. I think actually doing the final product was really important, and the skills I learned will carry. The lectures could be improved to make them feel a bit more worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very well structured class. I like that we submit each section of the manual separately, because it make sure we space out the work throughout the semester. I also like that we get feedback from Trace on every section we submit. I don't think the participation grade for every clas should be graded on a 0 to 0.5 scale, because it disadvantages people who are shy. There are students who are engaged in class but prefer to have discussions in small groups or one on one. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a ton of work. That said, I think this is one of those classes where the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. I had the extreme fortune to work with an organized, motivated group and we picked an intervention topic that was extremely interesting, which made the course work a lot more enjoyable.\r\nStrengths\r\n-This is a skills-based class. Although I was not super enthusiastic about this class at the beginning, I can see how much I've learned and grown in this class and I have mentioned this class in job interviews for some of the tangible skills I learned (e.g. developing a conceptual model).\r\n-This class is flexible and has lots of room for creativity, which is both fun and challenging. It was pretty exhausting to create all of the intervention activities, but it was also really fun to create new things in a way that we don't get to do in a lot of classes.\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-I didn't find the readings that useful and I stopped doing them after awhile because of how much other work we had to do for the class.\r\n-I think the evaluation module is the weakest part of this class. I think this module would really benefit from having guest lecturers for this component (Marney to talk about the psychometrics, Kathleen to talk about process evaluation).\r\n-I'm not sure the discussions in the class were always super useful, as they seemed very specific to individual group projects. I think this class would be an interesting opportunity to use the \"flipped classroom model\"--watch a recorded lecture (or a real-time lecture) on Canvas, and then use the class time to troubleshoot and work on class projects.

Sometimes the lectures were difficult to follow for people are are previously familiar with the concepts, but discussion facilitated greater understanding and application. The interactive discussion components and intervention practice opportunities made the class and assignments approachable. I also appreciated the peer review aspect of the assignments in that it gave us an idea of various styles and approaches to the assignment. ",

Grading was inconsistent and seemed overly nitpicky, often without much explanation for why points were deducted. Clearer expectations would strengthen the course. ",

            "\u00a0I really like Trace. He expects a lot, but he bends over backwards to be flexible and to make things manageable for us. I do wish we got feedback in a more timely fashion. In addition, I think there were some \"big personalities\" in this class that got a lot of attention just because they made a lot of noise. It would be great if he could use his facilitation skills to draw out some of the quieter people so that we hear from more than just a few people in the class. ",

If you are taking it, I would also recommend being in a group and focusing on a topic that most interests you.

My best advice is to pick a group that works in a similar style to you and to pick a topic that you genuinely care about, because you are going to get to know that topic really well. (It helps a lot if you, like me, have already done a lot of work on a certain topic and didn't have to start from square one.) I would recommend this class is you're interested in designing interventions or if you're interested in the more creative side of public health. Just know that it's a lot of work and you need to really commit to that work to enjoy the class. ",

Very useful, fun, and interesting course! ",

Having an understanding of the theory and process that contributes to a successful intervention as well as the writing abilities to describe ideas around public health and issues of interest. ",
