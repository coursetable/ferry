            "\u00a0This class taught students helpful writing skills, and gave students advice on writing beyond this course. We also had the chance to practice some editing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Habits to avoid in writing ",
            "\u00a0It's difficult to explain what this class does for your writing in tangible terms--it really breaks down and rebuilds everything about the way I'm used to writing. I've never taken a class that so thoughtfully and purposefully helped me to develop my prose, and I feel more confident in my writing and my voice than I ever have before. Truly amazing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved significantly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make my writing clearer and more vibrant. I learned how to write good sentences. I learned how to identify and improve bad sentences. I learned how to read and edit more closely. I learned that the best way to improve my writing is to keep writing and writing and writing. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write critically, evaluate my own work, how to collect words and thoughts onto the page. ",
            "\u00a0Writing is thinking! This course has helped me become a better writer because I learned how to think better. It's amazing how much clearer prose becomes by honing in on the core of each sentence's purpose to what you want to say. I've come away from this course with a new sensitivity to the structure of each sentence I read and write, a concrete editing routine, and most importantly, a confidence as a narrator that is absolutely necessary for writing that's clear to the reader. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to consistently write essays I felt proud of. I learned how to write with more clarity and accuracy. Most importantly, I learned to judge how my writing is read by others. This class was less stressful AND more educational than many of the other writing classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I hold a master's degree in Professional Writing from Mass Dartmouth.  I'm a published author. That said, I learned so much in this course that it was worthy my entire time at Yale! I essentially learned how to write. ",
            "\u00a0I perfected my writing skills and I also became a more acute reader in english, paying attention to sentence structure and the selection of words used by other authors. ",
            "\u00a0Never took a better writing seminar. The craft of writing. The craft of reading. How to think about writing. Life changing knowledge. "

            "\u00a0I felt the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned pretty well with my expectations. It had been awhile since I had taken a writing class, and this class was unlike any of the previous classes I had taken. The professor was very nice and his criticism was constructive. ",
            "\u00a0Well ",
            "\u00a0I don't really know what I expected, but those expectations were far exceeded. I don't just know my writing better--I think I know myself a bit better too. ",
            "\u00a0Very well! ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more than I expected. I was expecting lots of platitudes, but the course ended up being very concrete and detailed. It was great to dissect individual sentences each week and to look closely at writing done by both professionals and classmates. I think my writing improved distinctly over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Over the semester, I felt that my writing (and with that, thinking) definitely improved. It's important to remember that your writing progress isn't necessarily linear--but this class will give you the room for improvement to make it better. Verlyn's office hours were particularly helpful to go over individual pieces and the incredible line edits he makes. ",
            "\u00a0Very much so. ",
            "\u00a0All expectations were exceeded. My prose tightened, my ability to deploy a cleaner composition increased.  My insight into the English language soared.  Loved the course. ",
            "\u00a0I knew that it would be challenging for me to show remarkable progress in the class, since I am not a native english speaker. However, the method used in the class empowered me to believe that it was possible for me to express my ideas in a clear and consistent way, following Verlyn's suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0The expectations were vague, because the course itself was designed upon a single concept: to write well. "

        [
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course was the lengths of the weekly writing assignments. It helped to make the combined workload with my other classes more manageable. It felt a bit odd at first to receive feedback on a writing piece and not edit it, but other times it felt good to put it aside and move on to something new. I felt that it was also really helpful that the professor offered students a written list of \"helpful writing\" tips. It felt good having something physical to walk away with.   \r\n\r\nI think Yale FES needs more writing courses. Either that, or make it very clear to students what classes are offered that they can take for credit at other Yale colleges that focus on writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructor is engaging, sets very nice reading assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: manageable weekly workload that balances personal writing and outside reading really well (so nice to finally have a class that doesn't just assign reading for the sake of reading), depth of feedback, weekly structure of the class, classroom environment that encourages vulnerability and growth, Verlyn is a kind and wonderful person and one of the most caring professors I've ever interacted with\r\nWeaknesses: truly none, I maybe could have benefitted from one or two more off weeks to balance the weekly two-page expectation but getting in the habit of weekly writing was part of the point of the class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of writing opportunities, in-depth feedback, great discussions, nicely curated set of readings, good advice from Verlyn, generous flexibility in completing assignments, manageable workload, appropriately challenging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Verlyn's handwriting, lack of perspectives other than Verlyn's (it would have been nice to read what other writers have to say about writing or to hear from them in person as guests) ",
            "\u00a0Make the most of this class by writing about what you're interested in, and in different ways. There is no genre to stick to feel like you have to stick to! Going to Verlyn's office hours each week will really help you understand the feedback he gives each of your pieces too. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses come to mind. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't see any weaknesses. The strengths were sophisticated, because we were asked to write two pages a week, but oh my gosh was that difficult! Difficult because we were supposed to refine our work weekly, and having 'just' two pages allowed us to do that. Please don't change a thing about this course! ",
            "\u00a0Among the many strengths of the class are the sharing of our texts with the group, the short but concise reading examples every week, Verlyn's advises and tips for writing better. Unlike other classes, I used almost every week's office hours to have feedback on my writing skills and to test the incorporation of some grammatical and punctuation techniques to convey a better meaning to my stories. ",
            "\u00a0The course is Verlyn. It all owes to his philosophy, his insights, his kindness, his design. It cannot be improved. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The professor can be very blunt about his feedback on the written pieces, but it's not meant to be mean. It gets easier to accept constructed criticism on the written assignments as the class progresses. The professor is also easy to talk to, so go to his office hours if you are struggling to think of writing ideas, or if you feel you aren't seeing the improvement in your writing that you were hoping for. ",
            "\u00a0This class will mark the \"before\" and \"after\" for your prose writing. One of the most important experiences I've had in my time at Yale, in or out of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT! One of the best classes I've ever taken. The professor is phenomenal, and the work load is not just reasonable, it is quite enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to improve your writing. Verlyn's approach will push you to get better, from wherever you're starting out. You get out of it what you put into it. The weekly writing assignments seem short, but it takes time and effort to do them well. If you rush through them, you're shortchanging yourself (and you risk embarassment, because the pieces are available to the entire class and Verlyn reads them closely). The class has the same structure each week, which provides a nice rhythm. Make sure to attend Verlyn's office hours on occasion, because he's very insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It will help you become a better grow as a writer, thinker, and human. Verlyn is also such a wonderful professor who wants to see every student grow, and has faith in every student to do so. He is all about writing as something anyone--not just writers-with-the-writer-aesthetic--can do. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. I can't think of a plausible reason why you shouldn't. You'll become friends with a wonderful professor, you will improve your writing, you will read excellent essays. And all of this will happen in a stress-free environment. No matter the level, you should give it a go. ",
            "\u00a0Come with an open mind.  Be prepared to receive critical criticism but it's well worth it.  Be open to change. ",
            "\u00a0Prepare to rewire your brain for a new set of tools - not rules - that will help you write and read much better. In this, process you will experience anguish and questions popping up all the time that will make you undecided on what to say and how to say it. But if you break past this barrier, then you will uncover an incredible hidden richness within you that will allow you to express whatever you want in many different ways. \r\nThis class rightly embodies what many people have said before: to reach your best level, requires constancy and consistency. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot of work. Two pages a week can take a toll. But it is worth it if you are serious about writing. Or even, if you just want to write better. It accommodates you no matter who you are. "
