            "\u00a0I learned how to be a better writer, to listen to criticism, determine what was useful, and to rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. I learned useful elements of structure, and how to read novels/stories for the benefit of my own writing, rather than for pleasure, something Caz really emphasizes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing fiction, specifically thinking about structure and character development -- Caz really stresses that you have to get to know a character in all these various ways before you can write a good story about them/ hear their interior thoughts, etc., and I thought that was super useful for all sorts of writing. It was also the first time I ever thought about short story structure and I feel like I have a way better grasp now than I did. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me become a much better creative writer and pushed me to think character first when I too often think plot first. The workshops with other students in the class made me think critically about my own work and others and made me more comfortable with sharing my work. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely became a better writer through this course. I learned how to approach the trickiest part of writing a story, figuring out how to start, which I think will be enormously useful going forward. I no longer feel like I need to wait for inspiration to start writing. I also learned how to be an insightful and critical (yet generous) reader of others' work, and how to talk through issues in a piece productively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to structure a short story and about how to engage in workshops in a way that is constructively critical. ",
            "\u00a0More experience in crafting and rewriting short fiction; giving and receiving feedback within the workshop structure ",
            "\u00a0I became a better writer because of this class. You learn to sharpen your eye as an editor, but not try and prove yourself as a critic, and to take criticism from your peers with the right balance of humility and skepticism. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely developed as a writer of fiction and as a reader of others' work. Caz taught us how to improve writing our own stories, but he also encouraged us to become better at gathering tools from what we read. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is structured incredibly well - two workshops per student, and required revision. Caz is an incredible professor, that's a given, and probably the biggest strength is that your writing will get better, whether or not you even notice that it's happening (I didn't, at first). A weakness, I suppose, is that sometimes the atmosphere of an advanced workshop can be harsh, but I think you have to go in knowing that it's in your own best interest to develop a thick skin. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked a few more smaller creative writing assignments dispersed throughout the class. For instance, the first assignment we did where Caz had us write a short story based from a news article was very helpful and enjoyable. I also would have liked some advice on how to workshop and critique others works, just because I had never taken an advanced creative writing class before, and sometimes I felt a little nervous critiquing people's work since I didn't know what to really point out/look for. Also, sometimes I felt I needed more specific feedback on how to make my characters more realistic and understandable.\r\n\r\nAs for strengths, I liked how the workshops were set up, and the feedback I received from people in the class was amazing! I liked that Caz provided us with supplemental readings, and I enjoyed the guest speaker at the end of class. I also thought it was good that we wrote two short stories as opposed to one. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course had great discussions, great classmates, and a great professor. The only weakness was I wish we'd been able to do a bit more writing, beyond just 2 stories... but then it becomes impossible to get thorough feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how the course was structured and how Caz made his syllabus reflective of his students and their needs and interests. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job to adapting it's content to the needs of the students. I found our discussions and the peer feedback consistently useful. There were times that the written feedback from the professor could have been clearer, though this was always clarified in office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I think this sort of course varies wildly based on the other students in your workshop. This course's strength was the mutual respect and intelligence between Caz and every person in the workshop. We strove to understand each other and be helpful rather than competitive. It was by far the best creative writing course I've taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nI wonder if we could have done more experiments in form? Not many people in the class were experimenting structurally, which I thought was interesting. Often we'd read a story and look at the scaffolding of it, which I found incredibly helpful. The most helpful assignment, I think, was analyzing the William Trevor story; I wish we could have done more of that with different sort of stories. (For instance, I would have happily written a report on the mechanics of \"Lust\"). Many of the stories that the women in the workshop wrote ended up being short character portraits, balancing front story and backstory, shifting between scene and exposition, which is a good thing to learn. But there are so many types of short story out there, and so many ways to get a character portrait across! I wish we had been pushed to investigate more of them in our own writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Caz creates an excellent environment for a writing workshop. He leads the way in terms of being fair in offering constructive criticism but also supporting fellow writers. The course is great because he selects people who want to be there. My group was very strong, which made class a pleasure every week. And we all enjoyed reading each others' work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely yes. I found this course to be incredibly challenging in all the best ways. Caz has a way of dissecting you as a writer, and very bluntly identifying what your areas of struggle are, as well as bluntly identifying your strengths. His style of teaching probably isn't for everyone - he's not going to sugarcoat or hold your hand, and he can be harsh-bordering-on-cruel - but he will make you better, guaranteed. If you want to become a better writer, take this course. I think you'll either find yourself wanting to work really hard to make your stories better, even when they're garbage, or you'll decide it's not worth all the trouble, and either way you'll know how much you want to focus on writing in the future, and that's a valuable thing. I loved every minute of this course, because it pushed me out of my comfort zone and because I felt like, for the first time, I had a professor who was willing to be honest even when it hurt. If you're serious about writing, or you think you might be, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You write two fiction stories. Caz is great -- he's hilarious, he's caring but he doesn't baby you, he really tells you what he thinks. Workshop could get a little mean (not a prof who says, \"start out by saying what you liked\") but was really high level and respectful and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone interested in creative writing, whether or not they plan to major in English. The class will help you grow as a writer, Caz is really approachable, and the students in the class inspire you to give your best work and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend this course to somewhat serious writers with an understanding of the basics of fiction writing who are looking for sharp feedback to take their work to the next level. Fantastic course, especially with Caz. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0An excellent chance to spend a semester developing your fiction writing skills. Prof. Phillips' focus is disproportionately on character and voice but his feedback is honest and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It must really depend on the other kids in your workshop, but I had a very smart and supportive group. If you trust the others, you want to write well for them, and you learn to write with much more intention and care. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Caz is a really excellent professor of writing. He is fair and approachable and he does a lot to make the classroom helpful to each and every writer. He will take the time to get to know you and your writing style, whatever that may be. If you're interested in spending a semester improving your fiction, definitely take this class if you get in. "
