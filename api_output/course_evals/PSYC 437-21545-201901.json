            "\u00a0How to read AI papers, the structure and function of ANN, developments in machine learning, and future needs in AI ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed thinking more about the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and AI. ",
            "\u00a0I broadened my perspectives on topics like consciousness, artificial intelligence, psychological development, and neurobiology. I learned about advancements being made in computer science and cognitive science in attempts to understand the mind, and how such an understanding might be related to modern theories of computation. I thought deeply about what makes us human. ",
            "\u00a0This was an awesome introduction to many aspects of the mind that are being considered in the building of AI. I learned a lot from many disciplines, and also worked on synthesizing my own opinions on cognition. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course leaves a lot of room for discussion, which was awesome considering how broad the scope of the class was. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- The discussions really emphasize the thoughts and responses of the current students.\r\n- The workload is well-managed to allow you to engage with the material over the course of the week without being a significant burden.\r\n- Seminars are well-organized and well-led.\r\n- The readings from the syllabus are diverse and varied, which makes the seminars the same.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The only assignments are reading responses, for which you'll only get feedback if you present a particularly interesting idea or if your response is off the mark for some reason. Though specific feedback is not necessarily warranted for reading responses in a non-quantitative course, I would prefer a bit more back-and-forth between professor and student. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course would benefit from more structured reading response questions. "

            "\u00a0Yes take it if the subject matter interests you! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This is probably the best senior seminar in psychology, based on the experiences of my friends and myself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in the relationship between human minds and computers (as you probably gleaned by the course title), this class will provide you with an excuse to ponder and discuss any ideas you currently have and to explore new ones that surface as a result of your participation. It'll also allow you to read a nice sample of the literature on topics from language to deep learning. The discussions each week are led well and are tailored to the thoughts of you and your fellow classmates. The syllabus covers a wide range of material and you won't feel like you ever have to discuss the same topic twice. The presentations are a great way to get more in-depth with an area of AI/psychology that excites you. The final paper is a great outlet for you to synthesize the most salient discussions you've had over the semester. Overall, the class isn't a massive workload, but it enables you to think deeply about, well, minds, brains, and machines. If that's up your alley, then this course is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0It will blow your mind (ha ha) ",
            "\u00a0This course is really amazing! The people in it were some of the smartest people I have come across at Yale. Julian is great and so helpful and knows so much! Definitely take it if you can get in, it really helped define my senior spring! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the mind. It was great to come from a non-CS background and still be able to engage in the material. "
