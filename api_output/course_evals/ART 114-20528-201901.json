            "\u00a0I see everything totally different from before. More than anything, that's what this class teaches you. It teaches you how to see and turn what you see into a 2-D (and sometimes 3-D) work. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a lot about myself as an artist - how to let go of mistakes, how to plan, how to work hard but not push. ",
            "\u00a0The use of various drawing materials and an analytic approach to discussing and producing art. ",
            "\u00a0Foundational drawing skills and a development of composition. ",
            "\u00a0Contrary to its name, this course wasn't so much about drawing itself. There was a bigger emphasis on learning how to communicate personal interests through a visual medium, which was what I took away from this course. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) not too many assignments and therefore more time to work on each one, (2) flexibility to pursue projects that we found interesting, (3) fun. Weakness: not too much emphasis on rendering, but Matt was very clear about that from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it's a drawing course surrounded by an academic college - it was a huge breath of relief to work with my hands. The weaknesses are that I would have liked just a little more a) training in the beginning to become a better renderer and b) actual drawing in the course as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This isn't so much strengths and weaknesses, but as is the case with most workshop style courses, this course is a lot more enjoyable if you really commit to the assignments and the in-class work. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in making art but is apprehensive about actually doing it. This course invites you to work with all sorts of materials (graphite, magazine clippings, felt, plaster, etc) and will effectively push you out of your artistic comfort zone. "
