            "\u00a0I learned to critically analyze various texts regarding the perception of Arabs, and to discuss the consequences of these depictions. ",
            "\u00a0in depth view of orientalism and different ways people have viewed the arab other throughout history. With professor Elbousty you will write every week and practice your articulation and discourse skills in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to Middle eastern and orientalist literature with a lot of emphasis on the philosophical frameworks that can be used in analyzing such literature. This course by prof Elbousty will develop your knowledge on the region and help you read and reflect more on what it means to be the Arab Other. The course had very engaging discussions with a broader scope. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of teaching we received from Professor Elbousty was second to none. He knew his stuff extremely well and always came to class very prepared to deliver the material. Professor Elbousty made us read a manageable chunk every week and this was definitely my favorite class of the semester. Everyone in the class was open to different interpretations and this opened the door for lots of constructive and fruitful debate. Through these novels, we were able to learn about the history of the Arab world in a more engaging manner. We discussed many topics ranging from rampant corruption to colonialism and women's' rights. In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches in a very accessible manner, which means that we had students with varying abilities in the class! "

            "\u00a0Fantastic discussion, very interesting group of people with a variety of perspectives, Prof. Elbousty is great at facilitating interesting conversations and the literature we read was very informative and enjoyable to read. A more clear syllabus from would be my only, minute critique ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class. We had lovely in-class discussions and interesting assignments. Professor Elbousty is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0A definite strength was Professor Elbousty, as he was able to facilitate great discussion amongst the students. I only wish we couldve have gotten through more literature. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professor, Elbousty really knows his stuff and is a scholar on the literature and history. Soak up as much as you can from him. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were really great novels and theoretical works. Elbousty took great care to offer us so many amazing works in translation that are just a taste of the works that are out there. The final presentation where everyone talked about their novels they'd read was exhilarating. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and mostly the discussions were very powerful. The course had a good number of students that identify as Arab which made it even more interesting to learn from them about their reactions and how they chose to engage with the materials discussed. The professor cultivates a healthy environment where everyone feels welcome and happy to participate. The only weakness is that the syllabus wasnt clear enough to reflect how amazing the course was. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Elbousty is one of the best teachers I have encountered throughout my education. I have never come across a professor as kind, humble and engaging as him. We all looked forward to his seminars and we learned so much in a very inclusive environment.  The strengths of this class is that nothing is rigid! We read the allocated passages and come to class with many ideas ready to discuss. This means that you are free to take the trajectory of the class in whatever trajectory you deem most interesting. If you enjoy debating and coming up with your own interpretations, this is the perfect class for you. This is such a well-organized class and I would highly recommend taking a class with Professor Elbousty! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely if it's taught in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Every class I was able to learn something new because of the discussions we would have over important texts such as Orientalism. The Professor asked very thought-provoking questions, and challenged us on our views throughout the entire semester. This course was definitely one of the highlights of my semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Elbousty is great and the course content/syllabus is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as I feel it teaches one to be able to critically analyze various texts on a topic that is very much overlooked: the stereotyping of Arabs/Muslims. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!\r\nInteresting stuff ",
            "\u00a0Definitely!! Do not hesitate! This course has a good balance of everything. You will learn things you didnt know that you didnt know which is amazing!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is different from any other course since it puts all your skills into practice and that is how you learn best. We all improved dramatically throughout the semester because you are reading a variety of texts by different authors on the region. If you are interested in topics pertaining to post-colonialism and how winners shape the narrative, this is the class for youx In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches the content in an extremely engaging manner and you get so much out of every class. The feedback you receive throughout this course is very clear and constructive. It was my favorite class this semester since you read a variety of literature from across the whole Arab World. The amazing part is also that Professor Elbousty has met nearly all of these literary figures and has direct access to them if needed. "
