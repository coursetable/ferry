Too much of class time was taken up by student presentations and group activities. I would have much rather learned more about the Professors work and experiences. The class was also very redundant. For almost half the semester, we followed the same format each week with a different country. ",

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Great instructor who is always willing to help students, great TAs who were always available to meet, good class material \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: far too much reading assigned for a single class, especially if expected to complete all readings ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was informative.  I think it was a little scattered-- it tried to be a lot of things and could benefit by being more focused. I would recommend varying the group discussions, more one-pagers, and less reading overall. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty practical. Students' presentation is a good way to summarise the study materials but occupied too many class time. ",
            "\u00a0TFs play an important role in the class.  \r\n\r\nSaw one of the TFs' presentation in another class.  She just wasn't qualified to grade our presentations. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very informative and helpful. It is also well defined and clearly structured. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not taught as advertised in the course description.  It looked at advanced topics that really made the class not suitable as an introduction to health systems.  The reading load was extreme and often consisted of hundreds of pages.  There was no prioritization of the reading material and we often had little more than surface level discussion about it come class time.  We had group presentations every week which took up at least 30 minutes of each class.  I did not find these as a useful tool for learning as the student presenters often knew little more about the topic than the rest of the class (this was only because the topics were so vast, it is impossible for a group to understand it in a short period of time). \r\nThis class made me change my mind about pursuing a global health concentration. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. I did feel like I learned more about how to think about health systems nationally and from an economic perspective, which I had little experience with before taking this class. However, I really wanted to get more out of it than a largely economic viewpoint. I wish we had learned more about epidemiology as well as *how* to implement the strategies we so often talked about. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course! I like that it started with broad concepts before moving to case studies. Case studies were heavily focused on infectious disease, which might be good to change in future iterations of the course. Readings were heavy each week, it might be good to focus them a bit more or use one or two focus readings. It would be helpful to have more advance notice about what group we were in for discussion. I thought ilthe class was a fantastic capstone for the global health concentration ",
            "\u00a0I loved the student presentations - they were very well prepared and informative. I also learned a lot from the way Prof. Hecht approached past cases / program modeling. The course could be improved by having one week that walks us through how a case was approached and giving an overview of how the modeling was conceptualized. Overall it was a very enjoyable course and I learned a lot about health systems reform. ",
            "\u00a0Since this was the first year this class was taught, it seemed very unorganized and all over the place. After we finished covering UHC it seemed like we just jumped around from topic to topic. It's also completely unreasonable to assign so much reading--no one can get through 300+ pages per week while also juggling four other classes. It's also unfair to assign more readings the day before class. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of feedbacks were already discussed on the last day of class, but I think the class could improve if the class has a clear focus and realistic amount of reading materials assigned to students. Also, we often felt that we were rushed with time. If all the materials are to be covered with the same amount of expectation, I recommend longer class time or cutting some of the expectation.\r\nThe strength is that the class covers a very important topic for students in public health and global health. ",
            "\u00a0The course allowed me to learn quite a lot about countries' heath systems, and scale-up of certain programs. However, I wish there was more of a technical component. I also felt as if there wasn't enough assigned--maybe more shorter, frequent essays? ",
            "\u00a0This class was a bit disorganized, but I think only because it was the first time being offered. I thought student presentations went on much too longoften leaving no time for Professor Hechts lecture on the subject. Hearing more from Professor Hecht, and less from fellow students who are presenting on the same readings we all did, would be more valuable. Also, the readings were very long and did not include much guidance, in the sense that it was hard to filter through all the pages to find what was most important to know. It would be helpful to assign more concise readings, or highlight topics that we should focus on. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had more one pagers, and more focused reading assignments/class debates ",
            "\u00a0I liked the topics we covered and the cases. I wish instead of student presentations we had presented cases for different countries. I also wish the class had been smaller. Another thing that I had wished was the class was structured as if we were public health professionals. I was hoping to have a feel for what it would be like if I were to be working with an international organization (i.e. the UN or WHO or the World Bank) or governmental position. Either that or I had wished we went into more depth on the tools we had discussed in class. I thought it was too much of a brief overview of what skills were important because we covered so many of them. While I do know that there are classes like cost-effectiveness offered but some students are unable to take those classes. It would have been nice to have an idea of how those tools are done. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good introduction to the practice of global health and applicable policy and economic strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I was learning more from the students and less from the professor himself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Hecht's PowerPoint presentations on investment cases and scaling up methods were very helpful to understand how consulting companies work in a global health context. More real world application by asking us to replicate the presentation with our own global health issue would have made the course engaging and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I did not gain any substantial knowledge from this course. It clarified my understanding of how UN agencies work and what efforts they make in scaling up UHC globally, but the class quickly became repetitive after the first two weeks. I expected to gain more technical skill rather than textbook knowledge of how these organizations work. The midterm and final exams did not truly test my knowledge of any of the course material- they were summaries of papers already written, which felt like a waste of time. I did not feel challenged throughout the course. The group assignments throughout class time were the worst and the debates were lackluster. ",
            "\u00a0Too much reading, not enough guidance in preparing for class. Instead of breakout groups every week, I think I would have gotten more out of fewer breakout sessions with more detail (like consulting-style case studies). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor; interesting to learn about different countries experiences; interesting readings. \r\nWeaknesses: not a substantive learning experience. Could be more technical and focused. Class presentations take up a lot of the class, not sure this is the most interesting, as presentations just summarize the readings. \r\n\r\nTo improve, a more structure lecture could be more enriching--including more skills- and knowledge-building. The readings are excessive, there is no way anyone can go through all of them. If the class is going to focus on discussing the readings then students must be able to read them thoroughly to have an enriching discussion. This is not feasible with the amount of readings (sometimes 10 or more readings each week). Instead of student presentations, it would be better to have groups assigned to read a smaller amount of readings on one specific issue, and then have a discussion in plenary. Group exercises do not usually work in such a mixed and large class. Quality instead of quantity in terms of the amount of content the course covers would also improve its quality. Likewise, regarding the professor's presentations, teaching and discussing the process and methods, rather than just presenting results would make the class more substantive. ",
            "\u00a0The course is new, and had much to be improved upon. Clarify which readings are important/take priority, communicate course and assignment expectations, and manage time in the classroom more efficiently for effective learning. There would be discussion time set aside in lecture but it wasn't very effective in facilitating dialogue and would result in unprofessional debates. Instead of 2-hr lecture once a week, have 2 days of classroom time: 1-hr for lecture, 1-hr for group discussion/scheduled debates. I also recommend final presentations and that they be accompanied by a final paper that relates to the presentation students presented on. Lastly, practice makes for progress, and having more frequent 1-pagers will foster student success. ",
            "\u00a0My overall assessment of the course is below average to poor. This course was the ONLY YSPH course I was thrilled to take and excited to learn more. However, as much excited as I was, I was disappointed. I thought the course was going to be empowering, where I was learn from world leader such as our instructor and learn tools and actually practice coming up with a health care system reform through our exercises. in return, I had to sit in class hear the presentations the others present (who by the way only chose a portion of the readings to talk about) and do useless debates where we came up with the same answers week after week. I understand that the class might have seen conversational but that was not what I was looking for. I didn't want the students to summarize the readings but the instructor as us and walk us step by step on why the reform of that country was a success or a failure. Prof Hecht has such an amazing work experience that I wish he shared and inspired us. in the ideal world, i would have this class designed as one of the HBS case classes where the instructor picks ONE case (at most two main case), we read and together we go over the strengths and ways we would have improved that reform. while it was interesting to learn more about other countries reform, I honestly don't think I got any new competencies or skills out of this class that I didn't know before. Another weakness of this class is their class policy. while I understand that this was the first time the course was taught, it is not fair to the students to change the policies such as class attendance drastically AFTER the DROP-OUT period ended. Fall semester was the time when most of my interviews happened and they are set on a date that cannot be changed. it will not be fair to lose half the participation grade if you miss a second class. please understand that this is an elective course and not a core course, so students find the subject attractive enough to take the course, therefore such stick policy is just not fair. ",
            "\u00a0The course set up appeared to be very interesting, but was clearly not designed for a large class size which resulted in poor execution. However, the material was interesting and had the class flowed they way it had originally been intended I think I would be more enthusiastic about it. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of kinks to work out since it is new. I wished there was a weekly summary assignment to ensure that everyone read and enrich the class discussion.  Only comment is to be more upfront about assignment expectations and grading. Grading rubric was not clear to me. ",
            "\u00a0Wasn't what was expected from the title. Was expecting it to be more quant based and unfortunately it was not. Too broad overview of global health, overlapping Chimas course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Very insightful. Material was good. The course's downfall was the organization. It appeared very thrown together. Decisions that should have been published in the syllabus were emailed the night before a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course. Professor Hecht has a broad experience in the field of UHC reform, which he brings to the table. He is a deeply caring individual who clearly wants the best for his students. He is encouraging, supportive and kind. \r\n\r\nHis teaching assistants were brilliant - yes, their marking was tough, but they provide detail feedback to ensure continued improvement. \r\n\r\nI made great strides in this course, both in my ability to think about different perspectives and convey this understanding on paper. \r\n\r\nThis course was transformative.

Professor Hecht should definitely modify his teaching style, especially if the class size remains large. Additionally, I felt that the professor had a tendency to dismiss opinions from people who were clearly American and favor the opinions of those not brought up in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Exceptional instructor, course would have been better suited to a smaller group but he managed the classroom size effectively.  I'd encourage him to bring more of his personal experiences into the instruction in future courses.  I can appreciate that at times it may feel uncomfortable talking about all of your own experiences however as a class I think we all would have really appreciated that insight. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Hecht has obviously had a very accomplished global health career and has much to teach his students.  However, I felt his teaching style unfortunately missed this opportunity.  Global health concepts were vague and abstract with very few \"real world\" examples.  Lots of important questions about global health systems were presented, but how to answer them was rarely taught.  Reflecting on the course, I don't know if I learned any useful tools for addressing the most common problems many LMIC face. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Professor Hecht's lectures and particularly his commitment to group activities and debates in class. However, I wish he had spoken more about his personal experience, which seems very valuable given his work history. I also felt like he was a bit out of touch about how much work he was giving us and how much free time he thought we had. He often assigned several hundred pages of dense reading per week, adding extra readings late the night before class. As someone with an epidemiology background and little experience with health systems/economics/policy, I struggled quite a bit to understand the readings and figure out how to navigate assignments.

As an individual with over 20 years of experience in global health, I would have loved to hear more about Hecht's experience working for UN agencies rather than the surface level approach he took. These organizations are complex and rife with bureaucracy, and we would have benefited if Hecht taught us how to navigate organizational politics through innovation and entrepreneurship, as he has done. The group assignments are useless and should be removed from the next curriculum. More long-term group projects (like an investment case for a Ministry of Finance or Health) would help us better understand the material and the complicated relationships government agencies have. ",

However, I do think the amount of literature assigned was overwhelming, especially when you have four other classes to be reading for.

I also found his insight on global health policy making very interesting and would encourage him to make time in each class to give a bit of a lecture prior to the group discussions to help guide students in the right direction. Additionally, I would also strongly encourage that only a select number of readings be required and the rest optional to also help with the large workload. ",
