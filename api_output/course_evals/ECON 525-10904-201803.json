I thought it was a shame we only spent 1-2 classes on applications in the 2nd quarter, the papers we discussed were some of the most interesting of the entire course to me and it would be nice to have more applications in both quarters.  Then again, time is limited and maybe it's more worthwhile to cover all the theory in class and we can read the applications independently later. "
