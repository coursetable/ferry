            "\u00a0I believe the seminar style helped my speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0It's very chill and enjoyable and we learn something new every day. I can't think of any complaints, except for maybe a better textbook. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in its introduction to the Italian culture. By reading Italian from many different ages and analyzing poetry and music, I have been able to understand Italian in many contexts. While learning the more challenging tenses (subjunctive especially), the class was more fast paced and there might need to be some more review and practice time embedded in the curriculum. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend Italian because it is a nice break from heavier course loads while still challenging enough to not be boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Italian is fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It not only improves skills in speaking and reading Italian, but is a phenomenal introduction to the Italian culture. "
