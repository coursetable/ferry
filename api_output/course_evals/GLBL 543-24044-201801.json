I learned so much in every class period, and Justin is also very generous with his time and helpful over email and in office hours. I have never actively looked forward to a statistics course in my life but I was always happy to go to class. The course also felt very practical. All of the data management skills we learned were very applied and will translate to a variety of situations. I also generally learned a lot about structuring a research project and how to go about using data to answer a policy question. ",

The material learned in class felt very applicable. \r\n\r\nThis class desperately needed a TA! Prof. Thomas tried to respond to all student questions about the problem sets, but it would have been helpful to have someone else to go to for help. ",
