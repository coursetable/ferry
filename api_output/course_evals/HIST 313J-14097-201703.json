            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Indian history and how to better engage with priamary sources ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Indian history, a region I had never studied formally. I also developed my ability to read and understand primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0+ Critical insight regarding the presence of the British in India\r\n+ Ability to analyze features of India during and after Raj and determine how colonialism contributed to the development of those features\r\n+ Ability to engage critically with primary sources, be they pictorial or written ",
            "\u00a0I gained a solid chronological and thematic understanding of Indian history over the past 200 years, as well as the rich sociological, political, economic, and intellectual trends illustrated by said history. British colonialism, nabobs, sati ban, 1857 uprisings, ilbert bill, cow-killing, Hindu-Muslim tensions, nationalism, non-cooperation, all the way up to partition--it's all here. India functions as an effective case-study of the dynamics of colonialism, post-colonialism, traditionalism, modernity, nationalism, and liberalism. The strong emphasis on primary sources means you get to read a huge variety of material (court cases, ethnographies, short stories, novels, essays, movies) by a huge variety of authors (British administrators, Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru).  Some of the material covered by this course really does have far-reaching implications--I recall feeling particularly struck by how relevant the British-Indian debate on banning sati was to contemporary debates in Islamic thought relating to the relationship between tradition and modernity, for example. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with a diverse array of primary sources to develop a multifaceted understanding of how British rule in India developed over time. I also learned how to identify gaps in existing historical literature and from there develop an original, compelling historical argument. ",
            "\u00a0To critically read the history of British India from British and Native sources. ",
            "\u00a0The class was incredibly helpful in learning how to interact with primary source historical material and interact with different historical mediums. Furthermore the final essay helped develop my writing skills with incredibly helpful and constructive feedback from both peer review and the professor. "

            "\u00a0A little bit more feedback throughout the semester would be helpful, but Professor De was accessible in general ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have benefited from more secondary source readings. The primary sources were incredibly interesting and informative, but sometimes I felt like I didn't have enough background knowledge to properly understand them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I took Prof. De's lecture course on India and Pakistan after 1947 (which, by the way, I wholeheartedly recommend) three semesters prior to taking HIST 313J. I found that this seminar filled in many gaps that the lecture course left in my knowledge, and I think it'd provide a really solid base of knowledge regarding India at the time of colonialism for anyone interested in the topic. The readings, most of which were primary sources, were very interesting, and I think Prof. De did a good job of keeping the class engaged both with the conversation and with the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I enjoyed the readings overall, but I actually think there may have been too few secondary readings, which would have provided more modern (post-independence, post-partition) insights on the policies enacted during British Raj. (It also would've helped diversify the readings, which sometimes were heavily academic in a very early-20th-century way.) Also, there were some organizational shortcomings in the class  for instance, there were very often changes made to the syllabus under a week before the seminar in question was to take place. There wasn't really any graded feedback that came back to the class till nearly the end of the semester. There was also a general confusion among the class regarding when things were due, when we'd get them back, etc.\r\n\r\nI understand that this was the first time this seminar was offered, and I'm sure that subsequent semesters in which it is taught will see things largely smoothed out. ",
            "\u00a0The course really does a great job digging into Indian history to excavate fascinating subject material with far-reaching implications. The readings, if sometimes long and dense, were always excellent. The quality of class discussion was high. \r\n\r\nMore consistent feedback from the professor would have been appreciated. I had very little idea how I was performing in the course for most of the semester, and I know at least some of classmates felt the same way. Without that sort of commentary, I was never sure if I could be doing better and how to do better if I needed to. Beyond that, I think a tad more accommodation of students without previous exposure to Indian history would also have been appreciated. Metcalf was good, but an additional secondary source with baseline information on Indian history would have helped bring people like myself up to speed. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of this course is its engagement with a wide variety of primary sources. I also appreciated reading critical theory alongside historical texts, which pushed me to think about the limitations of existing historical narratives and seek opportunities to refine existing knowledge. \r\n\r\nA weakness is that I didn't get individualized feedback until I turned in my final paper draft; I would have appreciated getting feedback on my weekly reading responses and seminar participation, too. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was the first course that exposed me to so many primary sources which was great. We therefore piece together history ourselves. One big weakness I think is the level of background information provided to understand and follow in seminar. ",
            "\u00a0A little more feedback from the professor on the work we turn in. "

            "\u00a0Incredible seminar, if you want to put the work in. Professor De is engaged and fun, although he expects reading to be done and students to participate ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in colonial Indian history, then this is a great class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Prof. De knows a great deal about the cultural, political, and legal history of the region under Raj, and he was always helpful in filling in the gaps in student knowledge when we had questions about background info.\r\n\r\nI do think that the syllabus could be refined a bit to incorporate more theory and provide more organizational structure. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course, with two caveats. One, it is  not an introductory course to Indian history. If you don't have at least a baseline understanding of the region's history, the course might be more of a challenge that you expect. Throughout the semester, Professor De has us read a supplementary text (by Metcalf) that outlines Indian history as a way of keeping everyone informed who isn't, but I don't think this single book was enough. I was quite lost for the first few weeks before I eventually found a foothold, and even then I felt I was always in danger of slipping. The quality of class discussion is very high and rather advanced;  as such, it can be challenging to jump in for a newcomer because of how well-versed other students were in the subject material. The second caveat was the lack of feedback we had throughout the semester, though that could be fixed in the future. There aren't actually that many grades, so it could be difficult to know how you were actually performing it.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would still highly recommend and encourage the class. It's overall a brilliant seminar, with incredibly fascinating readings and the sort of in-depth and sophisticated discussions you hope for from a history seminar (and yet sometimes not enough). India has an endlessly intriguing history, and it functions as an effective case-study of the dynamics of colonialism, post-colonialism, traditionalism, modernity, nationalism, and liberalism. The strong emphasis on primary sources means you get to read a huge variety of material (court cases, ethnographies, short stories, novels, essays, movies) by a huge variety of authors (British administrators, Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru). \r\n\r\nProfessor De is a wonderful professor. He's charismatic, witty, and deeply knowledgable, facilitating class discussion so that it was both engaging and illuminating. He provided additional context when necessary and generally did his best to encourage universal class participation, even from students who weren't inclined to jump in. The readings he chose were excellent, and overall he always found brilliant and original ways of examining Indian history. I do wish Professor De would have given more feedback throughout the course. I was never certain what expectations he had of us, and if I was living up to those expectations, which could be stressful.\r\n\r\nIf you get it, I would strongly consider taking it! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommenf this course. It gives you the opportunity to study a fascinating moment in history, while learning how to engage seriously with primary sources. The readings are challenging and interesting, and class discussions are rich. ",
            "\u00a0I would take it if you are ready to put in the work to keeping up with the seminar. The readings are a lot, but they are interesting. Its also a kind of course where you get as much as you put in. Prof De is super friendly and flexible.He also had a wealth of knowledge! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course, really fascinating subject. "
