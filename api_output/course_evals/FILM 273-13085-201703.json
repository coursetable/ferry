            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with art and film more critically. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers films throughout the black diaspora made in the US, the Caribbean, the UK and Africa. The course goes beyond a survey to actually get at the heart of diasporic film theory and the question of whether or not there is such a thing as \"black film.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course completely shifted the ways I understand cinema overall and the potentiality of cinema coming out of the African diaspora. The syllabus was rich with the critical texts and films I have never been exposed to, which had not this course been an option, self-discovering these films and readings would have been highly unlikely. Over the semester, the information administered in this course developed me in areas that my other professors have taken positive notice of. Having spent two years at Yale University, so far this is the most beneficial class I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge and insights I developed in this course are so vast and varied that I can hardly articulate them here.  Discussions and readings on the style and content of black cinema as opposed to Western cinema, blackness, and the themes, visual techniques, and purpose of black cinema are all fraught topics of conversation that benefit more from being views as discourse than hard and fast facts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about African American film theory, and learned a lot about the topics and tools discussed in the black film cannon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some very influential Black film scholars and filmmakers. I learned to develop my analytical skills and engage with films in a intellectual way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an area of film studies that I knew almost nothing about before, as well as how to parse through difficult reading material. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely strengthened my understanding of film theory, exposed me to incredible and thought-provoking work that has been missing from my education, and generally allowed me to apply so many of the things I have learned in and engaging classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about more of the aesthetics characteristic of Cinema of the Black Diaspora and gained tools for approaching films as a text. ",
            "\u00a0I acquired critical thinking skills that pushed beyond the limits of euro-centric thinking. I think I also developed an greater understanding for underappreciated aspects of filmmaking auch as music. ",
            "\u00a0This was quite a hard class. I developed a greater insight on the meaning of diaspora, blackness, and the qualifications of a black film. "

            "\u00a0I appreciated breaking down readings in seminar because often they drew on theories and philosophies that I was not familiar with. I wish we had had a writing assignment earlier in the semester instead of just the final paper in order to gauge the kind of writing needed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The film selection and readings were really strong. I'm typically overwhelmed by a lot of reading but the articles were really fruitful. The weaknesses of the course are the allotted time spent inside the class with the professor going over the material-- it's not enough and really great discussions usually got cut off because of it. A longer course or second section over two semesters would improve this. ",
            "\u00a0The readings selected for this course were fantastic.  The course would benefit greatly from organization, both within each class session (i.e., how much time will be spent reviewing the film from the previous screening, how much time discussing the readings, how much time spent discussing the film IN CONJUNCTION WITH the readings, etc.).  A lot of the time, I felt like we discussed the readings on their own rather than in light of the films we were watching, and I actually feel like we discussed theory on its own far more than we even touched on the films.  Which is fine, I guess, if that is what the class mainly wants to be about, but in that case, the class should be more overt about being about black film theory rather than about the study of black films. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the readings. They were challenging, and complimented the films very well. The lecture style classes were also positive, because I was unfamiliar with the subject, and learned a lot in this format. This course could be improved through a smaller class size, as the seminar style was difficult for such a big class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was definitely the wide and diverse array of films we got to see. I would say the weakness was sometimes class discussions not being as structured as they could be. Also sometimes the readings were not directly relevant to the particular film, as in I understood that some of them provided cultural context or tried to connect the film to a broader philosophical school of thought, but sometimes it was hard to understand how we should synthesize the readings and the movies all together. But, this for the most part did not take away from the overall quality of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that the two biggest strengths are the material itself and the professor. The material is interesting to the point that even when it is difficult to understand you still want to work through it. The only weakness I could point out is that the reading material was occasionally too difficult and stunted class discussion, but that was corrected over the course of the semester by dividing the class into groups to discuss the readings before discussing as a class. ",
            "\u00a0Wish we had time to cover more films, but of course that would have sacrificed the depth of the course as well. I really appreciated close in-class reading of the texts, something I felt many of my other instructors have failed to take advantage of. In general there was just so very much to discuss in a way that always seemed to amplify the constraints of the allotted class time. ",
            "\u00a0I wished I had more chances to engage with the material before writing the final paper. I felt like while I was learning a lot I wanted to opportunity to apply it more often. I actually preferred the first half of the course more than the second half (where we broke into groups). I felt that the small group discussion dragged on for too long withot that much more insight. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it when Professor Bradley lectured with the material, and I truly felt like I was learning something. A weakness in the course was the approachability of the professor at times. "

            "\u00a0This is an amazing film class. A lot of classes that are cross-listed with film and other departments turn out to be more about visual culture than about actual film theory but this class tackles both very well. Definitely take it but be prepared to engage with the theory and talk about the films on a deeper level than just the narrative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially students who are interested in art of the black diaspora and critical race theory. Unlike most theory classes I've taken this course I found applicable to interpreting other forms of black expression. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, in fact, I believe it should be required learning for film studies majors. Often, courses such as these become optional because they are specific to cultural production outside of the canon of cinema, which is highly problematic and a reductive way of looking at non-western films. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course. It was one of my favorite at Yale. It was challenging, eye-opening, and beautiful, all at once. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Professor Bradley completely changed the way I viewed film blackness. The frameworks of thought in the class were intense and sometimes challenging, but ultimately very rewarding. This class really makes you think and we had so many very interesting and engaging discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I think this is a great course if one is interested in African American studies and film. The readings were usually inter ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are in the film and media studies major. I think the material is vital to anyone trying to complete a degree in that field. Few classes at Yale explore the work of non-white filmmakers, and this one takes a very close at both black film and the context within which it is created. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Absolutely!! Professor Bradley has so much to teach us and it is truly a blessing to have her at this institution! Interested students should keep in mind that while this course was totally accessible to students who do not have a background in film, the material is challenging and involves some serious film theory - so don't be afraid to ask questions! Draw connections to what you've learned in other classes! There is so so much to be gained from studying this extremely important work that has long been underestimated/undervalued/underappreciated at institutions like Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to another student! The work load is fairly light and Prof. Bradley is a great professor. There are screenings every week and engaging discussion in seminar each week. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is a engaging break for the euro-centric films classes offered by the university. I feel like through this course I had a greater appreciation for cinema because I was able to look at it from another frame of thinking other than the classical narrative form of Hollywood/European cinema. ",
            "\u00a0This is quite a difficult class, and it's intense. I would recommend this class to a student that enjoyed film theory, and wanted to diversify their course selections. "
