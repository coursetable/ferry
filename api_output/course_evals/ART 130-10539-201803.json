            "\u00a0Visual thinking and adventurousness in my work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to oil paint, different ways of applying paint to canvas (or more accurately, paper and gessoed panel), and a little art history. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to view and conceptualize painting, colors, and art. And, obviously, I learned the basics of painting. What an incredible class! You just show up; push yourself to think of objects, space, and color in different ways; and paint. What a great time! ",
            "\u00a0A newfound appreciation for all paintings every made  even Mondrian's that look remarkably basic with black lines and simple colours are so hard to pait! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better use paint (I had extensive art experience before taking this class), but also how to think about using paint strategically so as to make the most visually appealing moves. \r\n\r\nProfessor Storr also gave stellar commentary about art and art history, and in a way, besides the pure practice of painting, I felt that I learned most from his wisdom and experience from the art world. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to paint! I came in as a total beginner, and got a really important sense of paint as a material and art form. I feel like I improved so much. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course, you learn various ways to use paint as a medium. As an introductory class, the main focus is to learn and become familiarized with using paint and experimenting with colors, textures and representation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach oil painting much more seriously. One of Professor Storr's primary instructions is that we paint confidently, and allow each stroke to speak for itself. Being something of a perfectionist, this was and is challenging for me. However, moving forward I will try to take Professor Storr's advice to heart, and trust myself to put paint to canvas and leave it there. In the course I also learned more about the mixing and use of color, as well as technical skills such as how to stand and how to hold the brush. ",
            "\u00a0Basic painting techniques ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about using oil paint, holding a brush, mixing colors, brush strokes, and so much more.  Bob Storr has a wealth of experience . ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots of painting techniques as well as new ways to analyze and appreciate other people's paintings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better painting methods, how to observe a painting, history of painting, and how to best express yourself within your capabilities. "

        [
            "\u00a0We were given a lot of freedom in terms of time and project constraints. I highly enjoyed the projects and believe I am now equipped with greater freedom of creativity. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful exploration of painting in a supportive, relaxing learning environment. I loved going to class and devoting a certain amount of time each week to painting. I liked that it was mostly a one-on-one critiquing environment, with ample time devoted to painting rather than group critiquing. Rob's comments were very helpful and his love of painting is contagious. I also loved that there was a distinct lack of focus on grades, as Rob encouraged learning and expanding our technique above all else, no matter the skill level. The only weakness was that I wish we could've begun with oil paints earlier in the semester, rather than spending so much time on acrylics. The supplies were also very costly which may have posed a financial burden. Overall I absolutely loved this course! ",
            "\u00a0The materials were very expensive, and in the beginning, the instruction felt too basic and too rigid, but I enjoyed the second half of the semester when Professor Storr gave us more freedom in the style and subject of our paintings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Rob Storr is incredible. He's basically a legend, so just take his class to get a compliment out of him and live the rest of your life in joy. But really, I actually learned how to paint in this class. But more than that, I learned how to not be afraid of painting and the arts. Although Rob is a huge deal in the art world, he really emphasizes that anyone can paint and create art. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Professor Storr and the TF, Esteban: both were fantastic and provided a truly wonderful atmosphere for the class. Thank you! Perhaps a way to improve would be slightly more discussion of painting techniques before we are thrown into the deep-end, especially for complete beginners. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I really liked the in-class time we got for painting. That's what really improved my skills and I really appreciated that our painting sessions were always relaxing and laid-back. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I would have liked the class to include more critiques. I would have liked to get to know my classmates better by getting to take a look at their artwork more often. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great -- you really just spend 4 hours a week painting. It was engaging and kind of therapeutic. More crits could have been helpful but I appreciated that we spent most class lessons just painting. Not as much opportunity to paint outside of class time but that wasn't an issue for me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: students are encouraged to use their creativity when painting be it through use of colors or composition, critiques also provide insight on effective painting strategies.\r\nWeaknesses: limited to one semester with 2 classes per week ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the laid-back atmosphere and Professor Storr's immense knowledge. I believe the course could be improved with more formal feedback. We did not submit a single assignment for review, and the only feedback I received was the occasional comment from Professor Storr or Esteban as they walked around the room. I also felt that I could have used more constructive criticism- I was not happy with many of the pieces I produced but I was unsure what I needed to do better. As a final thought, I would imagine that students taking the class for a letter grade (I was taking it Credit/D/Fail) would be even less satisfied than I was with the lack of feedback- it was impossible to tell how you were doing in the class! ",
            "\u00a0More freedom ",
            "\u00a0I greatly enjoyed this class.  Two areas disappointed me , however.  During the portion of the semester in which we were asked to paint a fellow student's portrait, fully half of each class was spent sitting still posing for our portrait.  I felt very frustrated by this.  I wanted to be painting--and i wished that we had a model instead, so we could have spent our time doing what we were there for:  painting. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best things about this course was the way we truly started from the beginning of painting. For the first few weeks of class we literally just painted lines and shapes and learned how to control the paintbrush, which is something I never was taught in painting classes previously. Then we were given assignments within the freedom that comes with painting. Past painting classes have been a little too unstructured, so it was actually nice to be a painting class where I felt like I was being taught rather than just being given painting materials and told to go at it. I would have liked to have maybe taken more trips to the art gallery, or had more time for crits at the end. The crit at the end definitely felt a little rushed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very well done, and enjoyable. The greatest \"weakness\" may be the overall lack of a strict structure, but that was actually a benefit in my opinion and rare. But if you are someone who wants to know exactly what you are doing at all times, maybe that will bother you. The class felt like a good mix of critique, painting, and exposure to other artists. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for a fun and low stress course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, whether you have an art background or not. As long as you are interested in exploring painting and approaching it with an open mind, this course is a wonderful way to relax and escape the stressful academic setting of other Yale courses. It's very calming and enjoyable to devote 4 hours a week to painting in a supportive, low-stress, learning environment. The only work outside of class was to work on a sketchbook throughout the semester and turn it in at the end. Overall, I loved this course and wish I could take it again! The only weakness was the high cost of painting supplies, which may not make this an accessible course for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great beginner painter's class. The beginning of the course is a lot of \"hold the brush like this, apply the paint like this\", and after a while, the instructions turn into \"paint the person next to you\" and \"paint any object\", so there's both structure and freedom. Professor Storr is a bit pedantic, but he's a good at giving critiques and will tell you how to improve. Bear in mind though, this class is mainly an introduction to paint as a material/method. It is not a course about rendering or composition or color theory. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is such. an. incredible. class. If you have ever wanted to learn how to paint, this is the perfect environment. A nice, supportive environment where it is ok to push yourself, try new things, and fail. This class was perhaps a greater intellectual challenge than most of my others classes because I had to meticulously think and plan every aspect of a painting. It forced me to think about projects, colors, and space in a completely different way. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely -- gives you a new appreciation for painting from one of the experts. And if you're an art major it's great for early exploration in technique ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you can get into it, I would 110% recommend it  Professor Storr is a wonderful teacher and person. You really do learn how to paint, and you might surprise yourself with your skill level! Beware though, grades aren't given out during the semester, so people have little idea how they are doing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! You spend 4 hours a week painting, learning, getting to make all kinds of stuff. Rob really doesn't care about skill/ talent, he just comes in with a very generous mindset to each person and painting. I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking an art course and learning to paint in a very chill environment. Professor Storr is a great instructor, he would offer advice on what you could do to improve your work while you painted and also during critiques. ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should learn to paint and everyone should meet Professor Storr so I would recommend this course to everyone. However, I will say that it seemed as though it might be an unsatisfying class for those with zero artistic experience. Many of the students in the class were very talented and well trained. I felt as though the class presumed a certain level of competence. Although it is titled \"Painting Basics\" I do not think it is a class for beginners. ",
            "\u00a0Yes learned a lot about paintign ",
            "\u00a0We were not asked to do work outside of class.  Those who got the most out of this class were those who chose to do so (though this was difficult since we did not have a key to the studio.)  Bob Storr is a terrific teacher but his level of feedback on work was erratic and uneven.  He spent a lot of time talking about some students' work and very little on others'. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who genuinely wants to learn how to paint or who has been frustrated by painting before. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone interested in art (major or not). I was not an art major but thoroughly enjoyed my time in the class, and looked forward to coming most weeks. It's a good opportunity to embrace things you may be hesitant towards, and Rob and Esteban were very helpful and encouraging in my opinion. "
