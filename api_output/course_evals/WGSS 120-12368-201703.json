            "\u00a0I really value honesty, so I'll be very honest in my response. My lecture attendance in this class was quite weak. In fact, I think I went to like 5 lectures altogether in this course. I do truly wish I had the motivation to go more often, but with a particularly busy semester it was easy for my class attendance to slip.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do think I still gained valuable skills and insights. My writing definitely improved, not necessarily due to detailed feedback, but just because I had the opportunity to practice a several different kinds of writing and analysis. As a STEM major, I hadn't done much analysis like this since high school, so I'm really glad I had the opportunity to do so in this class. ",

            "\u00a0It was a really enjoyable course - I felt I learned how to think about feminism and food in a new way. A lot of people didn't come to lecture, which was kind of sad because I feel like it really facilitated learning and helped with the papers. I feel like forcing attendance at lecture would not be best, as I feel like it might ruin the feel of lecture, but maybe filming the lectures and posting them online? ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting lectures and papers, but as the papers do not relate to lectures and there's no attendance or exams, many people don't show up to lectures. ",
            "\u00a0papers were interesting to write ",
            "\u00a0Trumpler is such a phenomenal lecturer. Her voice is strong and her sentences and stories are clear and it's a lot of fun to listen to. It is definitely hard to incentivize everyone to come to class when it is in no way tied to the grade. A tiny attendance grade or discussion of class in section could perhaps help the turnout. The class is very interesting though, and I wouldn't want the content to change. ",
            "\u00a0I wish students were somehow required to go to lecture. It made me sad to see professor Trumpler giving a lecture to 10-15 students every class. She works really hard on her lectures and she deserves to have everyone taking her class in attendance. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like it was difficult to really  improve because each essay was incredibly different. Oftentimes I struggled understanding what was required for each style of essay. In particular the last interview essay could have more structure. While the prompts were very open ended, I felt the grading rubric was often limited and at times somewhat unclear. By grading out of a 25 point scale, TFs are looking for very specific things in the essay rather than grading it as a whole which discouraged us from taking a unique approach. \r\n\r\n The issues in class were not extremely relevant to our actual essays. I thought the material was interesting and engaging, particularly the material that was more focused on current topics (i.e. disordered eating and obesity). I think a stronger focus on current topics would encourage more students to attend lecture. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think the low work load was very helpful. So many classes assign so much reading and too many assignments which limits my ability to enjoy what I am learning because I am pressing for time. I greatly appreciate that Professor Trumpler's syllabus was fair and not stressful. I believe there should be more classes like this where students are given freedom to taking learning into their own hands. ",
            "\u00a0The papers were always very confusing topics. This may just be because I am an Econ major and I don't usually do this kind of academic work. I struggled every time to write them and sometimes felt like the purpose of my paper was pointless. While the TA was very available for help, the actual help given was lacking. Section was miserable - no one did the readings. While I tried to participate, many students felt no need to try at all. Unfortunately, people will not attend lecture if they know that it's possible to do the papers without it. Overall, the idea behind the course is super interesting and I think a very important field of study - the class just needs to be restructured. ",
            "\u00a0It was decently interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course could be improved by creating a stronger connection between lecture and section. ",
            "\u00a0This class could be improved by not being so ridiculous - The content of several lectures were absolutely startling and should never be normalized. This is a course that has the potential to be fun, but is not due to the unnecessary political charge that is thrown into \"gender studies.\" ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the discussion sections and lectures. The weakness of this course was the decreasing engagement of students in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it was only a few papers. It could be improved by making lecture mandatory in order to get a better turnout. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class could engage more with the essay's. ",
            "\u00a0It's amazing how much effort Maria puts into preparing for lectures, although the stark reality is that most people don't show up to class at all.\r\n\r\nThe more personal/informal style of writing that Maria expects takes getting used to, and each piece is based on a different type of source (e.g. cookbook, photographs, interview, etc) -- your mileage may vary. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the assignments are interesting and Professor Trumpler puts a lot of work into her presentations. A weekness is, however, is that because you are not rewarded for going to lecture, few people go to class. This ruins the class environment and makes it hard to take the course as seriously. Also, like other TA classes, the grading varies tremendously throughout the sections. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it shows students a unique lens from which to think critically about food and culture. The weakness is that some of the papers require an extremely different writing style that is not completely explained in class. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the lectures had very little to do with the essays.  I also felt that the structure or style of the essays were a little too vague at times.  Furthermore, I felt the grading was fairly subjective, especially since a lot of you grade depends on which TA you get. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are not really relevant to the assignments a lot of the time. The slides could have been made available. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of the course is that attending lectures is not required to complete the assignments. This is because all of the essays are based on primary sources so for someone with a very busy schedule going to lecture is a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very low-workload class, so it was ideal for someone like me who had a packed semester and wanted a pretty lowkey fifth class. I also really appreciate the breadth of our writing in this class, because I got to practice a few different kinds of analysis and writing styles.\r\n\r\nI wish the course had some enforcement of mandatory lecture attendance, perhaps even a simple 5 min quiz each section about what was covered in lecture that week? I had a lot of trouble finding time to attend lecture, even though I enjoyed lectures, because of my busy semester. While I totally recognize this is my own fault, I think I'd appreciate having my grade tied to lecture attendance as well since that would help provide motivation. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting overall, but sometimes I felt like the arguments weren't  quite substantiated by fact. I enjoyed that Prof Trumpler didn't always take the traditional view, but sometimes I felt that her claims were contradictory or ignored other arguments backed by fact. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of the course was that the papers were not very related to class content. ",
            "\u00a0I think that grading needs to be standardized among the TA's, some of whom are very hard and some of whom are significantly easier. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! It's incredibly relaxed, and lectures are really enjoyable. There's no pressure to take extensive notes, only to listen, and the papers just fall out of the lecture material. If you don't go to lecture, which you certainly can do, you might have a harder time with the papers, but it's not impossible. Best writing credit at Yale if you're not a humanities major. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. They may change the structure now, but this class was only graded on papers, thus people ended up not going to class since it had no effect on essays. If you are actually interested in Women Food and Culture studies, you could probably get a lot out of it, but it essentially became an easy writing credit for athletes. However, I did learn a lot about women, food, culture, and myself from the essays I wrote. Also, TA Aaron Sweeney was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course to take for a writing credit and is very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is lower workload and doesn't require a lot of engagement by nature, but by putting in at least a small chunk of work you can really learn a lot about topics that you might not see covered in other courses here. ",

As of now, however, it is a course with an extremely minimal course load, but you won't learn much if you succumb to the trend of not attending lecture/doing readings. I personally wish I had not taken it and taken a course I was more interested in, although it was nice to have not a lot of work! ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone looking for a writing credit that only required a few papers throughout the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. It may be tempting because of the light workload, but it is not worth it. I left each lecture feeling like I had just wasted an hour. ",

            "\u00a0No, its an easy writing credit but not worth wasting an opportunity to learn something in another course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you plan to go to class and do the readings. If not, you will be ruining it for other students taking the class, and you will not enjoy all of the experiences and knowledge Professor Trumpler has to share. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a great credit/d option, but if you are taking it for a grade it can be hard to make yourself focus on the writing style that Professor Trumpler and the TAs are want to see. ",

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class if you want a relatively low-workload fifth class. The material covered is pretty interesting, and you'll improve as a writer because the assignments cover a wide breadth of writing and analysis styles. The relationships between women, food, and culture can also be pretty exciting to explore. This course probably won't be life-changing for you, but you'll have a pretty chill time learning some interesting material. ",

If you do not attend lectures and don't do the readings, this course is a waste of your time. However, if you invest more into I think its a valuable learning experience. I think I grew a lot as a writer, and enjoyed the style we wrote the papers in.  Overall, I enjoyed the perspective I gained from Prof Trumpler and this class, and feed like I look at food related issues much differently now. ",
