            "\u00a0I gained thorough insight into how race and the law construct each other and the implications of such a process. We looked at a wide variety of issues, ranging from indigenous law to mass incarceration to the prison-industrial complex. The class revolves around critical race theory and the use of its scholarly methods to understand current issues. I also developed a clear understanding of how existing institutional structures operate to either maintain or intensify existing societal conditions. I improved my ability to make interdisciplinary connections and to engage in thorough discussions about how the works of different scholars are in dialogue with one another. ",
            "\u00a0critical race theory, the guest lecturers were INCREDIBLE, especially macias rojas, harris and mckinley. ",
            "\u00a0Such a different experience. Learned so much about race in America. ",
            "\u00a0This course will help you develop a thorough, fleshed out understanding of various critical perspectives on race in America and how to put them into use. Great skills that I have used in other courses and conversations with friends. ",
            "\u00a0This class enables an entirely different understanding of law from what might be seen on \"Law and Order,\" and in general involves an extensive theorization of American society and politics through various applications of systems thinking.  Professor HoSang's background as a labor and anti-racist organizer allows for a comprehensive view of law in terms of hierarchies, systems of exploitation, and how the nation-state is situated within power as well as an institution for deploying it.  There are also several guest speakers from a variety of professions who each have spectacular insights into law and adjacent fields. ",
            "\u00a0This class is everything I never knew I needed to learn/do/experience. It has fundamentally changed my understanding of power, race, the law, intersectionality, and oppression. Not only is the content both incredibly interesting and vitally important, but the papers for the class have forced me to not only formulate synthetic ideas, but to articulate these ideas in an effective way. I am a noticeably better writer and thinkers after completing this course, which was rather unexpected. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a foundational toolset for critical race theory and developed the skills to approach both academic and non-academic life with a new understanding of how race, politics, and law collectively produce the realities I see. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many different applications of race within law and politics that I am able to apply in everyday life along with my own major, which is very different from PLSC or ER&M. I learned through distinct events in the U.S. of ways in which racism, anti-blackness and many other issues associated with how treatment in the United States has evolved in different areas of race and precocity. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely have a greater vocabulary of race than I had before this class. I see myself using what I've learned in my everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from the course not only in studying the fundamental texts of critical race theory by legal scholars, but also in learning how to synthesize different texts and challenge my way of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING CLASS!  You learn about critical race theory, institutional power, and how to analyze and articulate power structures and inequality in the world.  Hands down one of the best classes I have ever taken and ever will take. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a working knowledge of critical race theory and its approaches to analyzing legal structures within the US context. ",
            "\u00a0This class possibly had most amount of useful, memorable information I've ever taken away from a Yale course. I felt like my ability to analyze the world around me, and specifically society/politics, grew by leaps and bounds. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of Critical Race Theory and its importance in the United States today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about critical race theory and how to begin to analyze different pieces of legislation and policy with regards to their inclusivity or exclusivity of different groups of people. ",
            "\u00a0I consider myself someone who knows a good amount about social and racial theory. But this course surpassed others that I've taken in the past in the depth in which it went into critical race theory. It was just amazing. The way that I interact with activism and social issues has shifted. ",
            "\u00a0I really had my eyes opened by this class. I learned so much about Critical Race Theory in both historical and contemporary circumstances, and gained great insight into how and why our society is the way that it is in regards to race relations. I will forever be indebted to this class for expanding my understanding of the world, for sparking so much interest, and for encouraging never-ending inquisition into societal norms and structures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about how race is constructed and reinforced through government action, as well as about how our own actions can be complicit in these processes or in racial subordination. This is really a class about Critical Race Theory, a movement started by law professors of color in order to call attention to these ideas. We talked about racial formation and the doctrine of colorblindness, intersectionality, how whiteness is reinforced by law, a little about indigenous law, Islamophobia, and mass incarceration. This class is not really very focused on court cases or specific laws so much as it is broad themes about race and how they have played out through government policy. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course!!! I learned how to use the vocabulary necessary for anyone interested in social justice, current US events, politics, law, non-profit work, equality/equity etc! It does a great overview of Critical Race Theory and its application in mass incarceration, immigration/crimmigration, islamophobia, the opioid crisis, native american federal law and so much more!! I now know how to properly explain what intersectionality REALLY means instead of just throwing it haphazardly into sentences because we READ Kimberle Crenshaw's \"Mapping the Margins,\" the original writings about intersectionality theory!!! The papers are all synthesis papers, which are challenging but really make you engage with the readings and come out knowing something new!! ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me new vocabulary with which to talk about and understand race, differentiated power structures, white supremacy, and the law. I gained the skill of synthesizing the work of authors and theorists, and comparing different theories to arrive at new conclusions. This class provided a good foundation for understanding critical race theory. ",
            "\u00a0This was absolutely the best class I have ever taken at Yale. Everyone desperately needs to take this class. I learned sooooooo much and gained a new perspective on how I think about many issues relating to race that I already thought I had understood. The class was a lot of work but it was all 100% worth it. ",
            "\u00a0So much new, amazing, great knowledge that I acquired thanks to this class. I don't even know where to start. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me clarify my sense of intellectual and professional purpose in a way no other course has, and solidified my desire to study the law. I couldn't have asked for a better way to close out my final year at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful introduction to critical race theory. It helped me develop a vocabulary for talking relationally about race: to critically think through concepts developed by academics and lawyers, as well as apply them to other concepts. The class provided this relational framework that provided a solid foundation to discuss current events, law, politics, etc. Professor HoSang designed the course with this learning objective--an ongoing conversation about race theory, resting on the notion that we live in a white supremacist society--and all the assignments slotted into that frame. In each essay, we were asked to synthesize the concepts discussed in lectures and sections, analyzing them together to see what new insights emerge. I am grateful to have taken a class that teaches the art of argumentation, and a very specific way to put sources in dialogue. ",
            "\u00a0The ways in which the law and politics have worked together to create race overall but it ingrain racial and gendered hierarchies throughout all aspects of American society. ",
            "\u00a0I became well-versed in critical race theory and have learned how to apply the interjections made by critical race theorists to analyze laws and policies that are shaped by race and religion and how they can disproportionately impact certain groups of people. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of how to critically analyze court cases, political events, cultural products, and more through multiple different frameworks of race theory and history. I gained the academic vocabulary to discuss issues of race in nuanced, interdisciplinary, and historically conscious ways. I learned how to think beyond conventional ideologies of race in order to better understand systems of racial suppression and possible avenues to freedom. I improved in my ability to read through dense theoretical and legal readings as well as draw connections between different political issues and apply academic concepts to everyday situations, news events, and pop culture. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course I learned about the ways Race, politics, and law intersects and the way I see this in my everyday life. I practiced my analytical skills and was challenged to practice my synthesizing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Critical Race Theory analysis, paper writing, legal scholarship ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I engaged for the first time with Critical Race Theory, and gained some really formative analytical tools that will help me engage with the law throughout my life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how race structures many facets of our society today, and I learned how to contest structural racial oppression. I also learned about how pervasive it is in the law surrounding reproduction rights, immigration, Indigenous issues, employment, criminal justice and so many more. This was a class well worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, i had never been introduced to the field of Critical Race Theory After taking this course, I gained a vast vocabulary on topics related to race, racial formation, and oppression. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first introduction to race studies, and it fundamentally overthrew the way I think about race and American society. We studied the work of critical race theory and developed an understanding of the ways race has been constructed and reified throughout American history and how that impacts the way we live our day to day lives today. I particularly enjoyed learning about the concept of whiteness as property, and race as ideology, just to give you a taste of the kinds of ideas we learn and put into conversation with each other. \r\n\r\nA skill that I'll take with me into all future courses is that of synthesisgrasping what new things we can learn by looking at one concept through the lens of another, using different thinkers to understand each other in a fuller and unique way. Each paper required this kind of rigorous thinking, and I found it incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop a new vocabulary with which to engage with critical issues. Although I had previously considered many of the topics covered in this course, I had no names for the patterns I was seeing, no way to actively describe what I was thinking about. This course helped situate me within these broader issues, and taught me how to synthesize new ideas utilizing this new vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about ideas of liberation; significant issues and movements in US racial politics; the nature of US law and its historical relationship to race. This class covered a broad number of topics but never felt slap-dash in its approach, looking at each topic sensitively and in detail.\r\n\r\nI learnt to synthesize different ideas and bring them together to form new judgments. I learnt about important thinkers, writers, artists, movements and professions. I was even inspired. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to look at race through a new, more critical lens. Coming from Australia, this was the perfect course to give me an understanding of the racialized history and politics of American society. I learned to think critical, to synthesize works from different authors and to ask difficult questions. This course brought up some challenging concepts and helped us to break down dominant social thought and look at things from different angles. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was phenomenally structured! The class is divided into four units, each of which cover a diverse but related series of issues. Each unit concludes with a synthesis paper that asks you to relate the readings to each other. Professor HoSang is very accessible and constantly in contact about any issues that may occur. ",
            "\u00a0I love that this is a lecture now! Super accessible to so many people. Amazing readings. Absolutely killer professor. My only two critiques are regarding the (super short) synthesis papers, which I have a feeling they might work to figure out a more defined prompt. At times it was confusing figuring out just exactly the professor expected us to write about. Second, the speakers (although great) at times felt more of a way to push law school rather than create a richer conversation about the readings for that week. Other than that, it was an AWESOME course and super cool, EVEN IF YOU DON'T PLAN TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL! ",
            "\u00a0I would frontload the speakers more. I think at the end students did less of the readings (oops) and that led to us being less engaged with really awesome speakers that deserved our full engagement. also having two papers for finals period was a lot. also it was really hard to write about a play because we couldnt revisit the text-- could we do another cultural object, like a novel/movie/song? The TFs gave exceptional feedback on papers-- super appreciated ",
            "\u00a0Prompts were too vague. But overall great class. ",
            "\u00a0Great concepts, HoSang's lectures are deeply engaging, and discussion in section can actually be pretty helpful in vocalizing ideas for papers. ",
            "\u00a0I have real difficulty narrowing down the strengths of the class out of all possible things I could list, but I would say that a particular strength is Professor HoSang's teaching style, which is highly adaptable to students' interests and abilities and makes generative use of guest speakers and a variety of literature from different fields.  He also manages to have a discussion-based lecture that incorporates a broad range of students' voices, using them to inform the direction of the class.  One trend in sections (as they were discussion-based) was often prefacing each section with a student presentation that in large part acted as a detailed summary of the week's readings.  While these (of which I'm guilty of doing) are helpful when students have had little chance to do the readings comprehensively, it can also provide a prime window for students zoning out and feeling disengaged.  A solution might be to discourage brute summarization in doing such presentations, instead encouraging a new application of the material. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. It's the best ever. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was a great way for those without a lot of experience in critical race theory to access the field of study. I thought Professor Hosang also created incredibly compelling lectures, matched with important, helpful readings. i sometimes felt that the synthesis paper responses, in the very justified effort to make sure students understood and could apply the materials, were hard to write without just making it a reading response or a full-on essay. Perhaps weekly reading responses would have been more productive for a lecture class that went through so much material every week. ",
            "\u00a0The topics all chosen and the materials used in every class were super interesting. I enjoyed the sections and the way they were run along with the class structures. The paper topics were all very interesting too and helped me engage with the readings better. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings are phenomenal and the class topics were great. The biggest weakness was that the assignment descriptions for synthetic papers were very vague, very few people had an idea of how to successfully do synthesis, then when you received a grade, it wasn't always clear why. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class.  Readings, lectures, discussion sections were generally fantastic.  the only thing I would change is to make one fewer synthesis paper (from 4 to 3).  Other than that change nothing.  Professor HoSang is truly amazing, kind, and cultivates an amazing culture in a lecture class.  His lectures are fantastic all around. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength of the course were the guest speakers who all brought a new dimension to their work by coming in and talking about it. The lectures were also another strength of the course. Each one was well-structured and engaging. The biggest weakness of the course was the writing assignments. I understood the pedagogical value of the synthetic papers and appreciated their intent of being more than just regurgitation. However, the prompts were often vague and the length of the papers themselves added another limitation to crafting nuanced and interesting arguments. I never had a clear idea of what a good synthesis paper would look like within the context of the prompts given. It would have been helpful to have even seen just a sample paragraph illustrating what successful synthesis looks like. It also might be more useful to have fewer but longer essays which would provide students more room for analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic on every level.\r\nProf. HoSang is the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale. (I'm a graduating senior #bestclasslastclass)\r\nWendy (TA) led the hands-down best section I've ever had at Yale.\r\nThe readings/syllabus were fantastic.\r\n\r\nProblems: no serious problems, but the paper instructions were often a bit confusing and I felt like I often got points off on my papers because I didn't perfectly understand the prompt. The paper topics themselves, however, were still interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the structure of the course and how Professor HoSang taught in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic. Professor HoSang is a great lecturer and made wonderful connections between the material and art, music, and other elements of society. However, I did not enjoy the discussion sections. I found them to be relatively unproductive due to time constraints and a lack of structure. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of this course is rough. There's a great deal of readings, although they are all interesting. The essays are short, but don't let that fool you, they are /hard/. The writing was difficultit is not simply regurgitating information, you actually have to think a great deal about them. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this class is that it had to end :( This class is literally flawless. Thank you HoSang and thank you Yale. Every class at Yale should take notes from and model after this class and HoSang's teaching style and passion. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course with some fantastic readings that really challenge students' ways of thinking. In particular, I really enjoyed the readings from Kimberl Crenshaw, James Baldwin, and Dorothy Roberts. Perhaps in the future, students could be asked to read all of Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, not just A Letter to My Nephew--I think there's a lot more in the whole book that's really important to read and has a lot of connections to the material of the course.\r\n\r\nProf. HoSang is also very engaging lecturer. He started each class with a piece of music or some images of art for us to look at, and I thought this was a really great way to ease into class every day and view our discussions within the context of American artistic culture. I also really, really liked all of the days when we had guest speakers. Maggie McKinley (a professor of indigenous law at Penn Law School) especially blew my mind, and I hope that she gets to come back in the future. I also enjoyed the Skype calls from \"practitioners\" who have jobs related to the course material, and it was good to see that connection between our discussions and real practice at the end of the semester. \r\n\r\nA place in which the course could be improved, in my opinion, would be in some of the paper prompts. I found the last two paper prompts especially difficult to respond to. The third prompt seemed to really be asking for two separate and very short papers to be included in one paper, and in some ways I felt that the topics we were asked to address were different enough that it was difficult to connect them without seeming to conflate ideas and experiences that were very distinct. I found the last paper topic even more difficult though--we were continuously told to focus on analysis and avoid summary in our writing for this course, but the last paper (which asked us to write a speech to give at our high school) seemed to contradict this. I understand that the paper was meant to be an exercise in making the themes of the course accessible, but I felt that the format of a high school speech maybe wasn't the best choice for this. I think I would have preferred it if we could have just cut the last response paper from the course--the deadlines were very much back-loaded in the course, and I really felt like this made it difficult for me to focus on the final paper as much as I wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths! The TFs are amazing, the people in the course are amazing and Professor HoSang is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! I would take this course just for him-- everything he says is extremely thoughtful but he also welcomes feedback and challenges because he is incredibly kind and humble. He really cares about the people in this class and their learning. He is one of the course's biggest strengths. Also the readings are AMAZING!! super engaging, not too long, and extremely interesting/pertinent to todays socio-political climate. I am even spending time over the summer right now going back and reading the books/readings I didnt have time to completely finish over the semester. I cant really think of any weaknesses- this class is a GEM and you will regret not taking it, I promise!! I never felt that any of the work was useless or busy work, everything we read, did, talked about and learned was interesting and made an impact in my academic trajectory!! I want to focus on racial justice because of this class!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing in its breadth and depth. We delved deeply into so many fascinating topics that I had never gotten to explore deeply before. We covered all the topics that I expected to but the best part of the class were the topics that I didn't expect to enjoy and hadn't known much about before. This class surprised me and delighted me in so many ways and truly changed the way I think. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class works better as a seminar than a lecture. It was sometimes hard to get clear instructions on the papers or even fully grasp all the concepts since the class was so large. There was also a lot of reading that we never really got to discussing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the brilliant lectures, the choice of readings, the kickass TAs, and Prof. HoSang's interactive pedagogical style. If there was one weakness, I think it might have been the class size; I know this has been offered as a seminar in years past, and I would have really appreciated the opportunity to take it as one. ",
            "\u00a0I would appreciate if Professor HoSang stated upfront that there are many ways to critically analyze race, and that this class takes a race-relational approach. It would be interesting to see what other frameworks are out there, not necessarily to incorporate them into the class but to have direction for further personal investigation. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course overall, the lectures were very clear and engaging. The only thing that was not very good was the amount of papers assigned in short amounts of time. ",
            "\u00a0This was incredible course in almost every way but one of the major weaknesses was a lack of clarity in terms of course assignments. Prior to this year, the course was taught as a seminar and the transition was a little shaky because the aims of Professor HoSang were not always clearly communicated through the TAs. For each of the synthesis papers, the criteria changed as we got closer to the due dates and this made the expectations unclear. ",
            "\u00a0This class had so many strengths, especially Professor HoSang's well organized, creative, and impressive lectures. I never felt bored in the class and felt each lecture brought new insights and revelations. This was well facilitated by in class discussions and thought exercises as well as the integration of music, art, and film to help students engage intellectually and emotionally with the material. I also appreciated how the professor and TAs were open to flexible to student needs about deadlines. This class was truly one of the best I've taken, but if there is anything that could be improved, I would have benefited from more structured and guided questions in section to help students work through the more theoretical and difficult readings. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course was very well designed and covered a broad range of topics. The lectures were incredible and the section was also helpful. My only major suggestion is the papers. I felt that the paper prompts were often confusing or too broad for too low of page limits. It would have been better to have narrower prompts and/or longer paper lengths with less papers throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all of the readings, and loved the way Professor HoSang connected the themes of the course to art and popular culture. I also really enjoyed the small discussions and in-class activities. However, I do believe the first unit of the course could be longer, and the amount of student opinion that was solicited during lecture sometimes took too much time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- amazing professor\r\n- well-taught material\r\n- a great class overall\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nI understand that the class was split up into 4 different themes/sections, but I wished we had equal amounts of time to write our synthetic paper for each section. I don't think two weeks was enough, although it was helpful that we could draw back on material we've learned in the past for the last couple of response papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Phenomenal lectures and engaging reading \r\n\r\nWeakness: There needs to be clearer instructions and expectations when it comes to the synthetic response papers. ",
            "\u00a0When thinking about this course, the word that comes to mind is layering. Professor HoSang did an absolutely incredible job providing many layers to this course, from teaching the high theoretical concepts of the course and asking us to think about them syntheticallyas well as in conversation with current art and mediato concrete ways that these concepts play into the world practically (we had a reading on one specific social activism group in California that was so instructive), to arranging for us to go see a play at the Rep and applying our course knowledge to our experience of it, and arranging for numerous guest speakers from other universities to speak on their area of expertise and directing us to events outside the course to further deepen our understanding of specific issues within race studies. I've thought a lot about ways to improve this course, and I honestly cannot think of a single item worth mentioning. ",
            "\u00a0The way that Professor HoSang asks students to synthesize in papers causes us to think about our writing in new ways. It is a new type of synthesis that is important to work through to improve our own critical thinking. Professor HoSang is really insightful and engages with the class. One of the main weaknesses of the course is the workload, as it can unexpectedly pile up with a lot of readings. However, this course is definitely worth the work and the readings are nothing short of interesting. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite aspects of this course is the level of engagement it offers directly to students. During lecture, small group discussion was often asked for -- about the readings, or just as often about the opener to each lecture. This often took the form of artwork, music, or a recent news report. The course first arms students with a vocabulary, and then provides tangible examples through the other units of what this vocabulary describes. I found this to be a very effective way of organizing the course. ",
            "\u00a0Every student at Yale needs to take this course. The course opens your eyes to the injustices throughout the history of the country and how those injustices aren't just blanket statements but are actually rooted in a long history of law. The legal emphasis on the course allowed us to take a more critical approach to race. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: DANIEL HOSANG IS AMAZING. One of the best lecturers I have ever had the privilege of experiencing at Yale, and someone who truly, passionately cares about his subject matter (rightfully so, since it's so impactful). Seriously, just take it for him alone. You will not regret it. Also the syllabus is perfect-- it's the right blend of classic critical race theory literature and modern, less-academic writing that you can really use to ground the theory in. \r\nWeaknesses: The TA's and the vagueness of the writing prompts. There was a pretty big disparity in the quality of your experience in the class depending on which TA you got. Mine was, honestly, not amazing. We just kind of sat in section with no structured outline, piggybacking off of one another in an effort to understand the text. I was also really looking forward to delving into the nitty gritty of the law aspects of the course (of which there were many), and my TA wasn't really as receptive to that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: emphasis on synthesis; the structure of the course; the guest speakers; bringing the Race/Politics/Law lens to yale-New Haven and current events; appreciation that these topics can be covered in many disciplines from legal scholarship to art; relaxed deadlines or two deadlines was generous and life-saving\r\n\r\nWeakness: Although I enjoyed writing all the papers, maybe there should not have been a paper on a play because it was hard to remember dialogue from one viewing and maybe the 4th paper interfered with the final paper a little too much. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always interactive and engaging and the teaching style was amazing. This course could have been improved by having shorter or fewer readings so we were able to engage with each text in more depth. "

            "\u00a0YES! YES! YES! This course will change the way you think of American society and your immediate environment. This course deals with a variety of issues that are extremely prominent in today's social and political climate, such as prison reform and immigration policy. This course not only challenges you to reconsider the way you think about these issues, but how you think of the law and knowledge as a whole. If you are even remotely interested in social justice, this class is a must take. Aside from being interesting and thought provoking, the structure of the class itself is extremely engaging. Professor HoSang constantly brings in a variety of guest speakers, many of whom are the authors of the very readings you will be doing. One of my favorite classes was when he brought Cheryl Harris, author of one of our readings (Whiteness as Property), and Karen Hartman (wrote Good Faith-a play which we saw as part of the class) into dialogue with each other. The synthesis papers really force you to not analyze the readings (and actually be motivated to do them), but to think about how they relate to each other. Even though the readings can be a bit dense a times, Professor HoSang is extremely understanding and tries to ensure that they are manageable. Even though the class is a large lecture, discussion is a key component of the class and it still manages to feel intimate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it!!!!!!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0YES! This is a must take class-- especially for political science majors!!! im looking at you!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes its life changing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you want to gain intellectual frameworks to understand and critique the American racial dictatorship, this course is vital. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Regardless of field, I would recommend this class to anyone because it enables a radically different understanding of American society and politics in terms of systems thinking and material exploitation and manages to do so accessibly. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers in particular were a highlight for me -- HoSang brought in some incredible thinkers, leaders in the field, and hearing from them was a revelation. I remember after Professor Maggie McKinley spoke, we stood and applauded for a very long time -- I walked out of the room in tears, and I know I wasn't the only one. Every lecture felt important, and I think everyone should take this class. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I 100% would recommend this course to another student. I think everybody at Yale could benefit from an introduction to critical race theory, and find what I've learned in this class deeply valuable to all corners of my life. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - Professor HoSang is one of the best professors at Yale, and this course literally changed my life. A must take for anyone interested in race in America, especially if you are considering law school. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS.  this class should be on every Yale student's bucket list, especially early enough on so that they can use this class to structure the rest of their learning.  You learn about critical race theory, institutional power, and how to analyze and articulate power structures and inequality in the world.  Hands down one of the best classes I have ever taken and ever will take. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly if they are interested in law. It is an accessible introduction to critical race theory and provides useful frameworks for thinking through legal issues through the lens of race. ",
            "\u00a0This was easily my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale! I learned so much about society, government, and the law, and also learned a lot about my self. ",
            "\u00a0Every Yale student should take this course. I'm a senior in biomedical engineering and this course was one of my favorites, if not my favorite, of my entire Yale career. It is not too difficult, is engaging, feels relevant, and will make you feel like a much more informed/aware person than you were when you entered the course. Even if you don't think you'd be interested in this course based on its title/syllabus alone, just show up for the first 1-2 classes during shopping period and check it out.\r\nAlso, it doesn't matter what political party you affiliate with/your politics/etc...I seriously encourage every single person at this university to take this course. I will concede that the course is fairly leftist in its critiques (i.e. looking at outcomes), which is unsurprising considering that critical race theory is a leftist movement. However, it offers useful tools of analysis for everyone, even staunch rightists, and points out how both people across the political spectrum are guilty of numerous wrongs, while specifically noting serious flaws in the current liberal system of law. If you aren't a leftist/liberal, I especially challenge you to take this course because it should be very intellectually stimulating for you!!!\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student because you learn a lot about concepts that are not taught in many other classes, and it is a lot of newer ideas that play a large role in today's society. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to other students. Not only is HoSang an amazing professor, but the course taught me more about critical race theory and other politics surrounding race than I could have ever imagined. A must-take course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Hosang is amazing and you'll learn so much. It's all incredibly interesting stuff. Every lecture had me dumbfounded at the things I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Please do yourself, and the world, a favor and take this class - or at least go to the shopping period class and then you'll see, just as I did, that you HAVE to take this class. Seriously, this class changed my life and my career trajectory. HoSang is a phenomenal teacher and speaker, and listening to him speak so passionately and eloquently was such a pleasure. He is the best teacher I have had and probably will ever have. I wish this class was longer so that it didn't have to end. The entire class gave HoSang a standing ovation at the end of our last class. I have recommended this class to all of my friends and I truly sincerely hope that everyone has the chance to learn from HoSang and have their eyes opened and perspective of the world changed. For the future of advancing social justice, please take this class and take the time to learn about this super important issues. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS CLASS ENOUGH!!! please at least shop it- you will thank me later!! professor hosang is amazing and the content is super interesting. I was never bored in lecture- he incorporates different types of pop culture media (art, songs, videos) in every class to keep it exciting and applicable to the real world. THis class has completely changed my worldview and academic path. If you are vaguely interested in politics, law, ANY social justice issue (this class touches on SO many of them), political organizing, race and class in america, gender studies-- then take the class! even if you aren't interested in any of these things, you should still take the class. This class teaches you how to be a better human in our society, how to be more mindful of the media and news you consume, how to think systematically, how to be analytical and how to speak confidently about issues that are usually relegated to the margins bc they are considered taboo. this is a unique class at yale and you would be seriously missing out if you did not take it. PLEASE TAKE IT!! yale needs more people who have learned about critical race theory and who are willing to challenge themselves to be comfortable being uncomfortable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it will allow you to view race, and legal construction of race, through an entirely new lens. This course will allow you to challenge your preconceived notions about how racism functions in our society, and this course will give you the vocabulary to articulate it. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!!!! This class is absolutely the best class ever. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. This might be one of the most useful classes that I have taken at Yale so far. Professor HoSang is amazing at explaining complex concepts and it really helps you see everything so much differently. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you want to know how to live an ethical life! Honest to god, I swear that that's what this course did for me. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It makes you think about certain points in history though different hierarchies of power and also helps you learn how to make certain persuasive arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor HoSang is an amazing lecturer and each class gave me incredible insight into our current social, political, and legal landscape. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class and honestly feel like everyone should take it. It was thus far my favorite class I've taken at Yale and many of the other students, including the seniors, felt the same way. We all stood up and clapped at the end of the last lecture. I was excited to attend lecture every session, knowing I would leave with a changed sense of how I view the world and my position in it. This class completely altered how I thought about topics of race, identity politics, and history that I thought I knew a lot about. Especially if you are fascinated by the intersection of law with art and humanities in struggles for freedom from racial subjugation, you will love this class and gain so much from it. HoSang is just excellent, the class is extremely well-structured, and there is also the opportunity to hear from several inspiring guest speakers and practitioners through in-person class visits and video calls. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I 100% would recommend this course. It is a great course about things that we see in our everyday lives and it helps you develop a new way to look at this reality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class opened my eyes to so many social and political issues and offered me a very important toolkit to reimagine politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone should read social theory like this, and be compelled to engage with it on the level that Professor HoSang asks for. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take this class. The professor is amazing, the material is rich and important, and at the end of the class you'll be genuinely sad that it's over. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course allows you to engage with both historical and contemporary topics related to Race, Politics, and the Law from a new and insightful lens. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take this course. Every single minute of your time will feel generative and instructive. Professor HoSang is an INCREDIBLE lectureryou will find yourself hanging onto his every word and marveling at how he speaks almost like poetry. And you will learn the context for how to see yourself as a person, no matter what your race is, and come away with a more compassionate and complex understanding of the society we live in. I think it's especially important given how many current events center around race issues. Take this class and not only understand the underlying forces, but also ways to move forward. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Of course. I have already told all my friends to take it when it is offered again. This class changed me in a lot of ways. Before taking it, I had never been able to see myself working anywhere near the legal sphere. Now, I am open to considering law school. Not because I now feel the law is the only way to tackle the issues presented in class, but rather that this class exposed me to the law as one entrance point into understanding and undoing these histories of violence and oppression. Another reason I loved this class and found it to be so formative is because the issues it tackled are so vastly prevalent in society. This class offers a way to more critically engage with our world as it actually is, while inspiring visions of a better future. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Take this course, then take more ER&M courses. Then come back and take another course taught by Professor HoSang because why not enroll in back-to-back amazing courses? The content of the course is disruptive in all the right ways and will force you to think about the history of white supremacy in the U.S. and how it impacts us today, through both law and practice. We had the top scholars in the field of Critical Race Theory visit our class, either through Skype or in person. The class is interactive, engaging, and intellectually stimulating. You will never be bored. ",
            "\u00a0YES. TAKE THIS COURSE ABSOLUTELY. If you have even an inkling of an interest in law and how it interacts with the construction of race/identity/material reality, take this course. \r\nStrengths: DANIEL HOSANG IS AMAZING. One of the best lecturers I have ever had the privilege of experiencing at Yale, and someone who truly, passionately cares about his subject matter (rightfully so, since it's so impactful). He is so incredibly engaging, kind, and isn't afraid to ground our studies in  and turn our critiques towards the institutions we actively benefit from (yale) which I so appreciated. Also the syllabus is perfect-- it's the right blend of classic critical race theory literature and modern, less-academic writing that you can really use to ground the theory in. And, honestly, it's the only law-related class I've ever taken at Yale that actually reflected a diversity of individuals in terms of race, class, and gender among both the students and faculty, which was heartening and definitely peppered our conversations with personal adages that really enriched my in and out of class experiences. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TA's and the vagueness of the writing prompts. There was a pretty big disparity in the quality of your experience in the class depending on which TA you got. Mine was, honestly, not amazing. We just kind of sat in section with no structured outline, piggybacking off of one another in an effort to understand the text.

            "\u00a0Hell yes! It was perhaps more of an introductory course but the readings were broad enough that there was something for everyone. I would especially encourage any PoliSci major to take this class so that we don't just reserve this topic for people interested in social justice! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was incredible. It included such an open dialogue and was filled with students from different backgrounds who each gave very personal takes on different issues in the course. The teaching was excellent and it is an unmissable Yale class. "
