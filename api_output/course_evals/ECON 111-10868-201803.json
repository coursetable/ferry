            "\u00a0The class covers macroeconomic outcomes in the long run (the Solow model, calculating GDP, labor and unemployment) and the short run (recessions, the IS curve, the Phillips curve, the AS/AD framework). We learned about the financial crisis of 2007-8 and the Greek debt crisis to a degree of depth I had never had before. We also delved into banking, liquidity, and balance sheets. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers the basics of macroeconomics in a very interesting way! It is a new and revised curriculum to make macroeconomics more APPLICABLE. For example, this class covers the basics like Investment-Savings (IS) - Monetary Policy (MP) Curve, the Phillips Curve, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply. We also learned about basic banking, the function of money, etc. The BEST THING about this class is taking it and applying it to REAL WORLD THINGS. We learned about Volker's disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, the REAL cause of the Great Depression (hint: it's not the stock market crash), the Euro crisis, and the situation in Greece/Italy currently. This is honestly a FASCINATING COURSE. TAKE IT WITH PROF AMAND WHO IS VERY SMART, FUNNY, AND KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THIS! ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the macroeconomic forces in the U.S., EU, and world, a sense of how to develop and use economic models, and an overview of the history of macroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic intuitions behind macroeconomic principles and how they apply to various systems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how the economy functions - the information felt immediately relevant to my life, other subjects that I'm studying, things I read in the news, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a pretty decent framework for macroeconomic understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the foundations of macro economics in this class. The first half of the course focused on the long run and the second on the short run. I particular value having learned about the Great Recession, the Great Inflation, Great Depression, Greek Debt Crisis, etc and how all of the tools and models we learned throughout the course played into each of these very real economic crises. I now feel like I have a handle on the Fed's role and goals, what it means when the Fed raises and lowers rates, and can much more meaningfully engage in conversations about the economy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how banks work, how the economy works, what GDP is and how it is counted, the Solow Model, and other various models that are applicable in the real world (Phillips Curve, etc). I developed a much better understanding about the marketplace and how firms and banks interact in it. I also gained an understanding for historical macroeconomic events as well as the economies of other countries, which I found very useful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of how GDP and national economies work, and how the US government (and other governments) operate in order to promote economic growth and stability via monetary and fiscal policy. I also gained a deep understanding of the Great Recession. ",

            "\u00a0The main strengths of this class are the lectures and Prof. Amand's obvious depth of knowledge and experience with the topic. I found his Socratic method of teaching in a (fairly large) seminar really helpful, and he's great at explaining complex topics in simple terms. If you pay attention in lecture, there's no need to consult the textbook. I think the class could benefit from having two midterms instead of one, as there's a lot of content to cover, and if the curve was based on both the seminar and the lecture combined rather than just the seminar. The problem sets were helpful, but we got most of them back long, long after handing them in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: FASCINATING COURSE! I really appreciate how the material is taught to be applicable. I feel like I have a better understanding of Fed policy, the 2008 crisis, the great depression, and the Euro crisis. This class is VERY strong in the sense that I feel like it is useful, neat information. Prof. Amand also is very knowledgable about it! Also, having the p-sets be based on effort vs. accuracy takes a lot of stress off of students :) It's very helpful in the long run.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much--sometimes the p-sets get confusing, and the online quizzes cover topics we don't learn about (which make them confusing too). Also, because the online quizzes seem to be sporadic rather than on a set schedule, sometimes I'd miss them :( ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thorough and well laid out. I wish the problem sets had been graded and incorporated more seriously, as they felt like a  missed opportunity to emphasize the material. But the content of the class was great, lectures were clear and engaging, and the textbook was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course did a good job of covering a lot of material, but it was often assumed we understood the concepts immediately and it was easy to get lost. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Amand was an engaging lecturer.  The fact that the psets were graded for effort was helpful, as it made me focus more on understanding the underlying material rather than getting the right answer.  The weekly quizzes were also helpful - they made us review the material without seeming like an unnecessary burden or stressor.  His entire attitude about the course was that the psets and quizzes were there to help you learn the material better - if you decided to put time into them, you would then do better on the exams and understand the material more fully; if you decided to blow them off, then it was your loss.  This mindset about the course made me more willing to engage with the material itself rather than trying to superficially understand things for a grade.  The only thing I would say for how the course could be improved is that sometimes in class Professor Amand would call on the first person who shot their hand up and not give the rest of the class time to think about the question and try to arrive at the answer as well.  There were many times when I needed about half a second more and I would have arrived at the answer, but my thought process (and opportunity to participate) was cut short. ",
            "\u00a0Macro works very well as a seminar, especially with Marnix -- he presents the material in a very interesting way and has useful anecdotes that apply to what we're learning in order to make it more interesting. Psets are graded essentially for completion, as are the online quizzes, so you don't have to be super engaged during the semester if you don't want to, but I recommend that you put effort into both and read the textbook if you want to have any hope for the exams (they are very hard). I did enjoy this class and found much of it interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure and flow of the course. Each lecture built on the last in a really logical way, and I felt like the quizzes and problem sets helped me solidify my understanding of each concept before moving onto the next. My favorite part of the course was how heavily it relied on real financial crises to show the models and ideas play out in action. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not throw too much information at you, it is just the right amount. It is well organized and separates various concepts, and every class builds on the previous one. It is difficult to really participate in this course unless your confident answering out loud which can often be hard to do while taking notes, however asking questions is very easy and comfortable. One weakness is that some concepts could be better spelled out and not assumed that they are intuition. The grading on the tests what also difficult to comprehend, because it was often unclear what professor wanted out of the question, because often a few questions were open ended. It also sometimes felt like these questions were not addressed in class, which of course I do understand because it is important students can make further connections and applications from what we learn--but it still made it confusing and frustrating at times despite lots of preparation. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always really interesting, and I found the material (with the help from psets, quizzes, and book reading) interesting and at a good level of challenging. \r\nI wish I had gotten more feedback on my psets (and that we had covered pset/quiz questions in class in general -- maybe by having a designated 5-minutes at the start of every class to go over particularly tricky questions), and also I wish that the pset questions more directly reflected what test questions would be like. ",
            "\u00a0I like the lecture style and how clear the professor is. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is AMAZING, homework was sometimes not super connected. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Amand is a very good lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures with relevant discussions. Pset feedback would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Professor Amand is an amazing lecturer. The weakness of the course was that it felt like there were not enough practice problems, making it tough to study for the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0a little less focus on why capitalism is good and a little more about what variables mean. Marnix is a top lad though. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed in the context of recent economic activities. The knowledge is well-organized and very relevant to understanding macroeconomics.\r\n\r\nI think there could be more substantive feedback on how to answer economic questions other than the midterm and final. Its hard to get a gauge for that skill with only two harshly graded assessments. ",
            "\u00a0Good course except that there wasn't much good feedback as to how well I knew the material because the course material and the quizzes/homework often didn't line up. The only reliable feedback mechanism was the midterm, but that's more high-stakes than necessary. ",
            "\u00a0There was an overall lack of feedback - while chapter quizzes were automatically marked, the problem sets were returned very late, if at all, and with minimal if any markings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the lectures and assignments were engaging and it always felt like we were learning useful information. Weaknesses: The format felt a little less like a seminar and more like \"high school class\" style with a group of ~30 facing forward taking notes on slides. ",
            "\u00a0I think Amand was very strong in connecting the material to real-world situations and and engaging the class. I think some of his explanations near the end of the class became a bit long-winded and confusing, however. He was also extremely slow to return assignments. "

            "\u00a0Definitely yes. Obviously, the class is a prerequisite to Econ, EPE, Global, but if you want a thorough and understandable explanation of banking and the financial crisis, you should take this class no matter who you are. The workload is fairly lightpsets never took me more than two hours. Curve is brutal, though. You will frequently be able to make connections between class and current events; every time I see a headline about the Fed or the EU or Greece I hear Marnix lecturing in my head. Don't miss out on Prof. Amand, a funny, intelligent professor and style icon. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class, even if it is not for your major--it's very valuable. In fact, after taking both intro micro and macro, I would say that this class is possibly EVEN MORE USEFUL THAN MICRO, especially if you are not an Econ major (or using this for a major). The seminar is taught VERY WELL. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF AMAND. He is an AMAZING PROFESSOR! His classes are super funny, engaging, and interesting. Also, Prof. Amand used to WORK in this field in Europe which makes him one of the best people at Yale to learn from on the Euro crisis, the situation in Greece, etc. He's overall a great, professor, and if you have the choice, you should definitely take the seminar with him :) \r\n\r\nAlso, the class is valuable because of its applications. Imagine being able to better understand what is going on in the U.S. with monetary policy or in foreign European countries. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's critical, interesting and engaging, and Marnix did a superb job teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone that enjoyed microeconomics and wants to further pursue economics for their major. As an elective course, I thought it could be challenging to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! I took the lecture-style microeconomics course and this seminar-style macro course, and I found the seminar version to be much more engaging.  Anyone who is interested in learning more about how the economy works should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it over the lecture for sure, since you can form a relationship with a professor and get more personalized help. Everybody should take at least some econ (if just to understand how the economy works), and this is a well-put-together way to do that. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. I found macro to be much more engaging and interesting than micro, and I especially valued being in the seminar class where I could feel comfortable asking questions during lecture. It gave me a great foundation to understand and engage in conversations about banking/the economy. I took because I thought it would be valuable to understand the subject matter, but it left me interesting in actually majoring in econ. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in macroeconomics. I did not love micro however I loved this class and was easily engaged in the material, it feels like you're learning concepts with real world application and importance. It makes many economic events understandable, and if you put in the effort your grade will be fine. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but recommend that they also do the reading in the book and stay on top of the class. Particularly in the second half of the semester, the pace of the class starts to pick up, and we cover a lot more material each day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the seminar version of introductory economics really facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0YES for sure the seminar instead of the lecture especially under Marnix. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was engaging and really good to help understand our economic system, even if not an Econ major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting, less math ",
            "\u00a0I am not sure this stacks up against the lecture class, but I think that the seminar style learning with fewer students is beneficial. However, it makes the curve much harder because everyone is receiving a higher quality of learning from the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0yeah, pretty solid, a little vanilla. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, especially if their interested in how modern, global economies function. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Prof. Amand is an excellent instructor ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take Intro Macro I would recommend taking Prof Amand's course, especially because he's a good lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Macroeconomics is a discipline that is empowering to understand the world. For this reason, I would always recommend the class ",
            "\u00a0Yes- it's an interesting introduction to macroeconomics. However, I wonder if the lecture would've been a better choice as someone who had zero background in macroeconomics (I sometimes felt less able to participate in discussion than others). Still, I assume the introduction is more engaging in the small class format. ",
