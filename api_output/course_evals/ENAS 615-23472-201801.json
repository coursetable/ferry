            "\u00a0I like how the course covered a variety of material types (carbon-based, metals, and polymers) and demonstrated how certain themes were relevant regardless of material. I think the one small weakness was that occasionally some of the material could be a bit repetitive but this wasn't too common. ",
            "\u00a0The course is supposed to focus on synthesis of nanomaterials; however, the course spends significant time on carbon nanotubes. This is the research area of the instructor; however, more focus on other nanomaterials would better fit the course's description. ",
            "\u00a0Improvements:\r\n-Greater emphasis on preparation and purification of nanomaterials\r\n-Comparing synthetic techniques for preparing similar materials\r\n-Learning about the challenges associated with scaling up reactions to prepare nanomaterials\r\n-Emphasis on green chemistry for preparing nanomaterials\r\n-Maybe learning about reactor design for nanomaterials? ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that the course was comprehensive in discussing methods for synthesizing nanomaterials, particularly carbon based nanomaterials. The main weakness of the course was that it was more of a literature review of current methods used to synthesize these nanomaterials. This would be very useful for those working with Carbon based nanomaterials or in a tangentially related field, but as a general course discussing \"synthesis of nanomaterials\" it seemed like a narrow discussion. What would be better is to introduce different methods for synthesizing nanomaterials and have assignments that allow students to think critically about which methods would be used to synthesize a particular material, why they would be used, and to give pros and cons of those methods. This could be done in class or out of class. Either that, or possibly make it clear before students register for the class, what the overall format will be. ",

            "\u00a0If that student is in the field of nanomaterials and works with either carbon based nanomaterials or biomaterials, then yes that student would benefit from taking this course. ",
