            "\u00a0The course gave a very good overview of a range of historical writing from the 19th century and was very helpful for anyone interested especially in the Victorian conceptualization of history and the past. The professors also gave very detailed and very helpful feedback for my writing: I would highly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of how the historical novel arose, as well as a greater cultural understanding of the 19th century and its attitude towards history. These understandings inform how I perceive history, and the historical novels I read. ",
            "\u00a0Feedback on the midterm paper was quite valuable, especially given the opportunity to revise. It's rare to get detailed feedback on a piece of writing from two professors, and both offered helpful, distinct critiques.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus was generally strong, especially the lesser-known works. Overall, an interesting course concept. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the concept of history in writing and its development over time. Also strengthened reading/writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class makes me to think in new terms about history, time, narrative, morality, and the intersection of these terms. It touches on Moral Philosophy, the Philosophy of History, and the study of narratives. ",
            "\u00a0I became a far closer reader and more intentional writer after this class. I also learned to understand history from a more philosophical standpoint rather than simply rote. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered an excellent examination of historical narration in 19th-century Britain. I came to the course with little background in 19th-century fiction or historiography, so I appreciated the opportunity to encounter several writers who were new to me (Scott and Eliot in particular). Professor Markovits and Professor Semmel also provided careful feedback on my papers, so this was an especially productive course in working on my writing process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how novels address historical consciousness. The course was very useful for thinking about narration and how authors consider their audiences. I very much appreciated readings in the history/theory/political philosophy, and how the professors led us through reading those in light of the novels. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course engages with a lot of high-power intellectual history reading, all very well-chosen but perhaps precisely because it is an eclectic collection, it could at times be a little bit challenging to tie different themes together and gain coherence overall understanding of the readings if you are not already thinking about similar questions in your research outside of the course (this can also potentially make coming up with research topics a little bit challenging) But very difficult to fault the course otherwise! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! I LOVE that it's taught by two professors--it works so well that way. The only thing I might change is having slightly less reading, and focusing in on the individual readings slightly more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Markovits, in particular, is totally brilliant, and Prof. Semmel is lovely too. Definitely a topic worth exploring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course seemed to be stuck in a disciplinary rut. It definitely wasn't a History class, and it didn't quite act like an English course, but it also didn't stake itself neatly enough into some kind of course-thesis to seem deliberately interdisciplinary. Class discussions were good, but not great, in part because the class size was much too large  we didn't even all fit around a table! I got the sense that a lot of people weren't entirely sure where to go for a final paper because the disciplinary grounding was so vague. ",
            "\u00a0Really strong professors. Papers were fun and reading material was great and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0I often wished the professors would more actively create a classroom environment in which all voices were heard equally and no few voices were heard quite often. It was also sometimes confusing to receive different, oftentimes conflicting, feedback on papers from the two professors, especially when doing revisions or when writing the final paper. But the structure of the course was great, discussions were often fruitful, and I learned interesting new frameworks for examining literature. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has no weakness. It is hard but it is absolutely a rewarding experience ",
            "\u00a0I think the syllabus was fantastic but for some reasons(only sometimes) discussions were sometimes stilted. ",
            "\u00a0This course's greatest strength is its admirable teaching. Professor Markovits excels at making Victorian novels, with their plots as complex as their sentences, feel easy; Professor Semmel does the same for the tricky political histories and shifting historiographies that we encountered in this course. The syllabus was well-constructed: challenging but not overwhelming, and with (as far as I could tell) just the right selection of novels and histories. I appreciated the opportunity to revise our midterm papers -- I have not often had the opportunity to get a second round of feedback on revised work, so this was a chance to keep working on my writing throughout the semester. I don't feel that the course needs changes; this is not a complacent shrug but the result of excellent teaching, a thoughtful syllabus, and smooth seminars throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was the ideal Modernities seminar for several reasons: (1) it joined literary and historical analysis brilliantly; (2) the professors complemented each other's styles and expertise, and modeled engaging scholarly collaboration; (3) it allowed students to pursue more historical/political philosophy or literary angles on our papers. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus is excellent! I think the professors distributed historians and novelists well throughout the semester. My one quibble is that we probably could have spent one class on Buckle and responses to him. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course! Prof. Markovits and Semmel are a dynamic duo and care about their students so much. You will learn so much and thoroughly enjoy the course discussions if you choose to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is a lot of reading, but really fun and worthwhile. Professors Semmel and Markovits are both so knowledgeable and pleasant, and they balance each other out in perfectly in discussion and areas of knowledge. Some of my favorite moments in the class were when they worked together to show us nuances in the topics that we could never have gotten with only one professor. Also: 10/10 high quality witty banter. ",
            "\u00a0If the works on the syllabus call to you, take the course and you'll likely have a good time. If you're not moved by them, I wouldn't necessarily seek this class out. It's a very solid seminar  no surprises. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Markovits and Professor Semmel are great and I joy to get to talk with. ",
            "\u00a0I will absolutely! If you are passionate about history and literature and the intersection of the two, what can be a better class than having a seminar with two wonderful professors? The class is incredibly engaging and it is the best class I have taken at Yale so far. Be prepared to work hard, though. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course, and I recommend taking any Professor Semmel and/or Professor Markovits teach. The syllabus was thoughtfully put together, and although there was a fair amount of reading relative to other humanities courses I've taken, all of the reading was interesting and relevant. Class discussion was engaging, and the two professors worked well together in leading discussiontheir styles, though different, worked well together. In the two papers, there was enough guidance available that I never felt overwhelmed, but also plenty of freedom to explore topics that interested me. Each paper got feedback from both professors, and that feedback was thorough and helpful. Overall this was a great course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to this class but likely more to humanities students than history. A lot of the students were able to relate much of our writings to past works they had read in other classes, and without some of that schema, it seemed like some students were behind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I took this as a Modernities seminar for the Humanities major; since Modernities seminars seem often to skew toward political philosophy, I was glad to take one with an excellent mix of history and literature. I was initially worried about whether I would enjoy the works on the syllabus, but it became clear in the first seminar that Professors Markovits and Semmel are teachers too excellent to pass up. (And my worries proved misplaced anyway -- the readings were actually quite enjoyable.) I cannot speak to a History major's experience of the course, but I would certainly recommend this class to students in any major who are interested in 19th-century fiction, historiography, and very good teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! I think that this is the ideal humanities core seminar, and taught me how to think about literature with a focus on the historical consciousness of the author and period audience. It's perfect for humanities and literature majors, as well as English majors. History majors: as the professors note on the first class, this will not be a traditional history class in terms of how you're talking about the periods, research etc. That said, it's a great time, and a wonderful opportunity to talk about literature. \r\n\r\nThe material was very interesting (I was a bit wary of some of the novels when I first saw the syllabus--Walter Scott, Dickens), but with the background from the professors, it is fascinating. The highlight of the course, however, was the excellent co-teaching. When I did the reading, I looked forward to each class meeting. I was consistently impressed by how well they co-lead discussions, and brought out helpful commentary from each other. Both professors were very encouraging and engaged with our comments, helping us read the texts better. "
