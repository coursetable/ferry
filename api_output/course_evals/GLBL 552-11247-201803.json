            "\u00a0In this class, I learned critical human rights issues in East Asia and South East Asia. As a class we learned the roles of major players in these issues such as governments, bodies like ASEAN, and private companies. Our discussions touched upon ASEAN as an agent of influence in the region, human trafficking, freedom of religion, and persecution in South East Asia. We also delved into topics of China's belt and road initiative, its use of hard and soft power to gain more influence in the global community, and its use of technologies for security and power. In this class we analyzed these topics and were able to apply our research and writing skills in our cumulative paper. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a good overview of selected human rights issues in East and Southeast Asia. I also came away from the class with a better understanding of ASEAN and the Belt and Road Initiative. "

            "\u00a0More structured lesson plans and supplemented with powerpoints/figures from time to time. ",
            "\u00a0This class was always a pleasure to attend. Prof. Cohen and Prof. Tsu are both very knowledgeable and engaging lecturers. The lectures covered material that was interesting and very relevant. Starting the class with an overview of human rights law could have provided a helpful setup for the rest of the course. Sometimes the discussions felt unfocused and wide ranging. It might have been helpful to pick a pair of students to lead the discussion portion of the class each week. Having the seats arranged in a circle also would have improved discussion. Overall, the class was great, but it could have covered more material. "

            "\u00a0If the student is disciplined in doing readings and enjoyed discussion, then yes. Otherwise, it would be a bit difficult to have concrete takeaways from the class if the student is not committed to engaging with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the material it covers. The class is laidback and interesting, and you can write a paper on any subject you choose. "
