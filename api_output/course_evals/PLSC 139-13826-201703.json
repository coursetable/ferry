            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically and comprehensively about U.S.-Russia relations. We touched upon every major issue between the two countries, analyzing both primary and secondary documents. The most valuable thing I gained from this course is how to put myself in the shoes of different policymakers, which we practiced every single class. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you learn a lot about U.S.-Russian relations since the Cold War - in spheres such as energy, terrorism, democracy promotion, and across regions such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a historical deep dive, with links to present-day developments. This was one of the few classes at Yale that legitimately allowed for discussion of multiple viewpoints in a civil forum - when discussing contentious questions in the sphere of U.S.-Russian relations, such as the situation in Crimea or in Syria, we heard viewpoints from many sides, and there was sometimes serious clash. This helps enormously with understanding the situation, and means you don't just base your viewpoint on some pre-written narrative. ",
            "\u00a0Detailed knowledge of recent Russian history, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the historical roots that inform the Kremlin's decisionmaking calculus today. ",
            "\u00a0Completely changed the way I think about US-Russian relations and US foreign policy as a whole! Incredible course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained tremendous insights to the inner workings of foreign diplomacy, as well as the long term and immediate concerns of both Russia and the United States in regards to their relationship with each other. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to write policy! I went into this class as my first polisci seminar and Prof. Graham was a great help at teaching the basics of writing basic policy memos. I also learned how to begin discussions in diplomacy. Prof. Graham often runs seminar by creating a table to see where US and Russian interests align, and then moves discussion to figuring out why the two have/n't cooperated on certain issue. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Thomas Graham is a really experienced practitioner, so I was a bit disappointed that a lot of the seminar discussions stayed at a relatively high level rather than going into more fine detail. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is Professor Graham  I could not ask for a better instructor for a class on U.S.-Russians relations from a former diplomat who knows the ins and outs of both Washington and Moscow politics. The only weakness of this class is perhaps that it doesnt go very deep into any of the topics, and I wish that we were able to pick more original paper topics. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very well organized ",
            "\u00a0It was extremely well-organized and perfect as is. I could tell Professor Graham has been teaching this course for years. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the class was Professor Graham's knowledge of the topic and class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the table. I really liked visualizing what specific issues the US and Russia had common ground on, then digging into the minutia of how the diplomacy played out. A weakness of the course is that it sometimes gets dominated by students who enjoy hearing themselves speak, though I think that's a usual qualm students have about seminars here. "

            "\u00a0Great chance to learn from Professor Graham, but a less in-depth course than I expected. If you're a GLBL major who knows something about US-Russian relations but wants to learn more, this is a good place to do it. If you already know a lot about US-Russian relations and history, you might not get as much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in getting a strong foundation of knowledge about one of the most bilateral relationships of the past century with one of the top experts in the field and how to think critically about it, absolutely. If you are already familiar with the topic and want to dig deeper, then this might not be the best course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - there's a lot of people talking about Russia at the moment, and many of them don't know what they're talking about. This course is a great starting point for learning about one of the more complicated bilateral relationships the U.S. has with another country. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you've studied Russia extensively or have no background knowledge, you will find this class extremely rewarding. Professor Graham is a wealth of knowledge and it is a privilege to learn from him. You will not regret taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Everyone interested in a career in foreign policy absolutely must take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely interesting.  However, it is not an easy class and expect your written assignments to be graded much more harshly than in other courses offered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you can get it. Graham is a gracious professor who is easy to work with. Who else would you rather want as your teacher on US Russian Relations than Kissinger's right-hand man on the topic? "
