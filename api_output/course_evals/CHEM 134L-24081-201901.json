            "\u00a0I learned introductory laboratory skills, like about the equipment and how to conduct basic chemistry experiements. ",
            "\u00a0While I did learn how to carry out scientific experiments using advanced equipment, write a lab report, and make graphs by interpreting data, all of this is due to the help of Dr. Huynh - I would not have learned these from the labs themselves and would've done really badly in the class had it not been for his help.

            "\u00a0Yeah I learned nothing hon ",
            "\u00a0The structure is easy to follow, but sometimes it doesn't match up as closely as it could with the lecture, which would be helpful. You may have to teach yourself concepts before quizzes since the lecture component of the course takes place right before the quiz. ",
            "\u00a0The lab reports were very nit-picky, which made them very tedious to do.  They were too picky and took points off for formatting when I think they should have focused mainly on the content. ",
            "\u00a0The grading rubric can unreasonable at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course is terrible. It is recommended to take this concurrently with Gen Chem 1 but frequently quizzed material will touch on topics you have no way of knowing without self studying some of the hardest topics beforehand. If this course is designed to teach you to apply experimental skills then it shouldn't also overlap hugely in unfair ways with other courses.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Dr. G employs  hugely unfair and punitive grading policies. If the reports were graded to make people better chemists then that would be fine, but he has tons of small and irrelevant procedures that he demands around presentation etc. that don't teach you anything but suck huge amounts of time for no reason. The lab reports take far too long and are extremely intransparent in grading. This course needs a huge overhaul starting by removing the punitive grading and arbitrary things take up huge amounts of time and effort for no apparent gain. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the TA, Mioy. WOW, Mioy went above and beyond anything he needed to do to explain everything so clearly. I actually looked forward to lab and laughing with my class (we all got really close). He had this google doc where we could ask questions about the lab reports, and held extra help sessions to ask questions. I really felt like this let us open up and get to ask questions without feelings stupid. ",
            "\u00a0Quite literally every aspect of this course is a weakness, aside from the instruction of Dr. Mioy Huynh. I was fortunate enough to have him be my TA, otherwise, I would have understood very little. Dr. Huynh put in tons of effort to make resources available to every student, as this class is honestly designed to suit students who come from more privileged backgrounds and have prior experience being in a lab. Having never stepped foot in a chemical lab, I had no idea how to work with the equipment, write a lab report, or even make a graph on Excel, but Dr. Huynh was very patient and taught me how to do each one of these. He made an entire website, mioy.org, in order to have accessible information for the lab and allow students to ask questions about the lab in real-time. Otherwise, the grading done by Dr. G is entirely too harsh for prelab quizzes, labs would've been unnecessarily long, lab reports are filled with jargon and aren't written in a clear scientific way, and prior knowledge is recklessly assumed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Moi was a good instructor\r\nWeakness: grading was quite harsh ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was that we learned about different chemical processes and were able to apply it in a real lab setting. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was honestly the time commitment. 4 hours of lab time per week plus the 2-3 hours it took to write lab reports was a lot for a 0.5 credit class. Changing the labs to 3 hours would make it so much more manageable especially since lab has to be added on with so many other classes since it is only half a credit. Students would also be more focused and really able to spend time thinking about the labs beforehand if it didn't take up so much time on lab day. ",
            "\u00a0Our TA was great! kept us engaged the whole time and made lab about as fun as lab can be. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Change your major ",
            "\u00a0This course is necessary for most students interested in medicine, chemistry, and/or biology. In those cases, yes, but it is a very high workload for a half-credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  It was a much more fun way to learn chemistry than sitting in a lecture hall with 300 other students. ",
            "\u00a0If necessary for prerequisites, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0Never if they could avoid it. Sadly this course has become the worst one I have to take at Yale because its necessary for the pre-med track and some majors. I pity the people in a similar position. For a half credit course this takes a huge amount of time and makes life hell for 0 reason. Yale has a huge number of pre-med students, all of whom suffer through this terrible course and hate it afterwards. Every single person who I mentioned this course to has hated it and commiserated. The sad thing is that it appears Yale college and Dr. G have been around for so long that there is no interest in changing what is obviously broken. This course does not have to be this bad and is not at other schools. Serious overhaul is needed before I could meaningfully recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0There is no other place to put this, but I think what really made this course what it was in a good way was Mioy Huynh, our instructor/TA. This course evaluation only gives us the option of providing comments on Dr. Ganapathi, which I honestly did not really see all semester. But Mioy did an incredible job. He always made lab feel like a safe space where you could learn, even if you went at it in a slower way and or made mistakes. He took what would be a very stressful environment and made it much more manageable, and, because of that, everyone learned more and came to appreciate chemistry. He was also always very available for help with the lab reports and it was clear that he cared for his students and wanted to make sure that we did not feel overwhelmed with the course. In essence, if Mioy is teaching this course next year, take it with him, he's an incredible instructor. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get Mioy as your TA, YES take this course! I learned so much with him. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class unless you absolutely must for a requirement, and take it with Dr. Huynh if at all possible. ",
            "\u00a0No, if not necessary for pre-med. It's a lot of time and effort that I don't know was necessary for learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if a student needs to take it as a prerequisite for pre-med or their major, or if they have a lot of extra time. It is a fun class but takes up so much time. ",
            "\u00a0No one takes chem lab for fun, but if you can get Mioy as your TA, you will have a great time! "
