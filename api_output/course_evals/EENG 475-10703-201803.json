I basically taught myself the material from the lecture notes, which were unfortunately incomplete. The homeworks were also helpful to learn the material and understand their applications.\r\n\r\nSince the class covered many topics, it was hard to determine what we actually needed to know for the assessments, which were much easier than expected. The assessments cover mostly theoretical ideas so the math is not that important. ",

There are very detailed lecture notes that supplement the lectures which is particularly helpful when studying for the midterm and final exams. ",

I felt like we jumped around quite a bit. For example, the final did not cover many of the topics I was expecting from the areas emphasized in the course. ",

            "\u00a0The psets were great to facilitate learning, as were the sections with Luciano. It would've been better to have them at a time where everyone would be able to attend. Lectures were engaging and prof. Zucker is great at making concepts sound interesting, but not so much at making them clear... I've sat through lectures completely lost even though the concept itself was not very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Zucker knows so much. Luciano (seemingly the only TA) is pretty helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Zucker is sometimes too smart for his own good -- he'll dive right into some pretty advanced notation in lecture and it's clear no one has any idea what's going on. Textbook he uploaded was okay but clearly is a work in progress and way more advanced than the course, rendering it effectively useless. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Zucker is a way-above-average engaging lecturer. I have a track record of consistently falling asleep in lectures. I never fell asleep in high school (unless it was a movie with the lights out...yikes), but in college, I have fallen asleep in almost every lecture I have ever taken. These old professors just bore me to tears.\r\nI have never fallen asleep in Zucker's class, and he is consistently joking with the audience/engaging us with questions. Definitely one of the best lecturers (if not the best) I've had here.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe number one weakness of this course were the exams. I, and many friends taking the course, complained to one another after both the midterm and the final exam that they were not reflective of the material covered in class. I remember walking out of the midterm and wondered how half the class didn't fail since I felt like I used knowledge I had learned in other classes (versus this one) to answer many questions. The final was similar: I felt like many of the questions were on things I found not important, or minor topics. For instance, one question of 7 on the final was on something we had mentioned in class briefly, and there was a section and an image of it in the notes. We never had a pset on it, and were generally just told the general idea of how it worked. Suddenly, the very minor, mentioned in class and in the book *way less* than many other topics not on the exam, is a full-fledged and very confusing question that many people had to guess to solve. Other questions were on things I din't think were substantive at all, or were far too specific on really nitpicky things that we, again, never discussed in class/weren't forced to go into such detail on in psets.\r\nMy friends and I made outlines of all the key topics we thought would be on the exam, for instance, and only half the questions were on things we thought were important; the rest came out of nowhere. Many topics we thought would be very important were never tested on.\r\nFor these many reasons, I feel like the exams were poorly written and did not accurately assess the knowledge/skills gained by taking the course.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness was that the first two psets were graded way harsher than the last psets; in particular, the first was graded WAY too harshly. I think people complaining was what made the others graded normally, but that's only my guess. Since psets are weighted more than an exam, grading the pset harshly is a no-no. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lecture was very difficult to follow. Could use more examples. The lecture notes were also difficult to follow. It would be nice to have coding assignments in Python instead of Matlab. ",
            "\u00a0The subject of this course was exceedingly interesting, though I learned this more in retrospect from reading the lecture notes. It's true that the lectures were a bit hard to follow, but this could be helped by clearer overviews in the beginning of class so we would know what to expect and look for. The homework assignments were also extremely cool and very well-designed. ",
            "\u00a0Again, this was a survey course that tried to cover a lot. The motivations Zucker tried to induce in us were oftentimes not realized until the very end of the course - but while studying for the final, everything clicked. I hope that Zucker can reformat his textbook draft and deliver his passion in a clearer format. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent problem sets, an engaging lecturer, and thorough course notes. Sometimes notes were incomplete and confusing, and lectures were a bit fast-paced, with variables not well-defined so sometimes hard to follow. ",

            "\u00a0Very interesting materials with good combination of biology/neuroscience and CS/math. \r\n\r\nBut the professor's lectures/handwriting were just incomprehensible. It's simply better to read his notes instead of going to his lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The content of this course is really interested and it's great to learn linear algebra by applying it to the real world. But that's how I ended up viewing this class, and I wish that there was more freedom to apply what I was learning to project. ",
            "\u00a0The material is hard to grasp and often is difficult to understand during lecture, but the course has many TAs and ULAs willing to offer support and will be the ones to get you through it all. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and lecture notes are very disorganized but the contents are pretty fun. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was too dense, and that the material could have been greatly simplified to avoid confusion as to what we are expected to know for our exams. Also, I thought it could have been more organized in terms of topics, and what would be expected on examinations. A great deal of time was spent in review sessions because lectures were difficult to follow and poorly organized. It would have been more productive in most cases to review lecture notes independently. Then again, it was the balance between high level abstraction and technical details that could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0The grading was a little subjective at times and it was difficult to study for exams because we were given no study guides one what would be tested. Additionally, the text book we used was incomplete which made it hard to study for some chapters because there was missing information. Despite that, the class was really cool and interesting and I learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Zucker is very enthusiastic and passionate about the subject. You can see that. Unfortunately that's all you glean from his lectures. Usually they were all over the place, and it was hard to grasp what we learned for the day. I never really understood what knowledge I should've gained, and this is likely because the nature of the subject is so, so complex, so if there isn't clear communication, you're a goner. \r\nMatlab is also a pain to work with, especially on an Air because your system lags like hell. ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy working in MatLab in this course. I thought that this problem was too much of a survey of math concepts and biology concepts, and very little focus on computer science concepts. I would have liked to have more complicated programming assignments that could then be tested on exams, rather than needing to memorize abstract diagrams that felt irrelevant to the application of computer vision work. ",
            "\u00a0Having exams that better followed the content covered in lecture and the assignments would've been much nicer. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, as the instructor made the material seem interesting and was engaging. I took this course to fulfill a science credit, and ended up having much higher engagement than expected. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in biology. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class with both a CS/Math and biology background. I believe the computer programming assignments are too easy for a CS major, the biology is too low level for a biology major, and we didn't need to understand the math at any sort of high level. In the end, I am glad that I learned the material, but I am dissatisfied with how I learned it (mostly through self-teaching). ",
            "\u00a0Recommended only if you want to learn about biology as well. Do NOT take it if you just want to learn computational vision, as Zucker will say many times. It is pretty interesting how biology relates to mathematical models of vision, but you will not learn the skills needed for practical computer vision ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in biology and feel okay about your linear algebra skills (or ability to pick it up), then take it!  CS classes at Yale are typically relegated to two extremes, hard and interesting or easy and dreadfully boring.  This class nicely falls in the middle of the spectrum.  It's interesting enough to keep you engaged, but takes solidly under 10 hours to do the psets every 2 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. Probably only if the student does not have much background in the material, and I would recommend taking the course Credit-D, as both exams were pretty tough. ",

            "\u00a0Take it if you're interested in a biological approach to computer vision. Zucker is kinda unique in his style, so go to the first few lectures and realize that all of them will move that fast or even faster.\r\n\r\nWorkload: Two exams and some psets. Psets are critical to actually understanding the algorithms because they're pretty hard to wrap your mind around until you actually implement them. The exams are also wayyyy easier than the lecture, which moves super quickly and is pretty hard to follow unless you're paying very close attention ",
            "\u00a0This course is very useful for anyone with an interest in how vision works and the computational models used in vision research.  If you are a computer science major, in particular, this course is useful because it covers ideas used in all computer science classes that may never be explicitly taught (e.g., basics of neural networks, idea of linearity, linear algebra concepts as they relate to CS).  (I'm not sure how my advice would relate to non-CS majors.) The key requirement on the part of the student is to have excellent mathematical reasoning at a higher level of abstraction (no nitty gritty calculations requirement).  This is what makes the course challenging, as the intellectual level is certainly higher than other courses I have taken.  That can be a good thing for some people, but others may consider preparing more (e.g., probably should take linear algebra and reviewing concepts of multivariable calculus) before taking this course.  Similarly, exams are testing a higher level understanding, which involves more in-depth thinking during exam preparation rather than memorization and reviewing homework problems (which is certainly a better way to go about things, as it enhances learning).  All in all, the professor does a terrific job of teaching all the background information you would need to know, so it is good either way.  The lecturing style is also engaging, in the sense that the professor utilizes the whiteboard and slides, and explains things in an intuitive way with the use of visual learning tools. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! For the CS majors out there, take this course if you want to satisfy your intellectual curiosity about how animals see things. Prof Zucker makes fascinating connections in the material between neuroscience, math, the biology behind computer vision, and even how Renaissance art manipulates human vision. Compared to other CS courses, this course stands out to the extent that it really excites your curiosity and asks questions that you might not expect to be asked in a CS class, like: \"Why is it that when you see a shadow on the ground you can tell that it's not a hole?\" ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who has NOT already taken some of the higher level image processing classes in Biomedical Engineering. In particular, the required Signals & Systems class and the elective Biomedical Image Processing and Analysis (BIPA) cover a lot of the material covered in the first half of the course (especially BIPA). Since I had taken both of these already, the first half of this class 100% felt like a gut. The second half branched out and didn't feel like a gut; however, I think if you've already taken those classes, there may be electives that are more intellectually stimulating/worth your time because they don't repeat what you've already learned.\r\nIn general, if you're coming into this class without any knowledge of image processing, I think it's a good intro course.\r\nI do think it could've been advertised better, though: I thought it would have a lot more neural network stuff when we were literally never given a pset on/tested on anything regarding neural networks, and I literally took this class hoping to learn about neural networks since that's the topic of my senior project. /shrug ",
            "\u00a0I think the content was interesting, but the presentation of the lectures would have to change for me to recommend it to someone else. Might be because it was designed for a small class but an enormous number of students signed up this semester. ",

            "\u00a0I would! Its an easy but interesting course, tells you how much you can d with basic coding skills. ",

That being said, sometimes his lectures are a little hard to follow because they're not so direct. Still, he posts very extensive online lecture notes that can more than make up for a missed class (so you could probably not attend class and only read the lecture notes and do fine, although his lectures are very funny and entertaining so you should probably go to them). The problem sets are all in Matlab, and they are very, very well structured to facilitate learning, like impressively so. I learned a lot just by doing the problem sets. The midterm and final are less about the class material, and more about what's on the problem sets. ",

            "\u00a0Would recommend with hesitation. You will be stressed if you don't have a very strong math background and coding, while possible to figure out as the semester progresses, is an expected skill. ",

It was my favorite of the semester and definitely strengthened my skill set in a variety of ways. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a CS major who need a science credit, take it. Otherwise, no way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course has an amazing TA, who is very helpful and devoted ",
            "\u00a0The short answer is yes, I would recommend this class. I felt like I internalized several concepts of linear algebra in this class, which was an unexpected outcome. This was also my first exposure to biology in a really long time. IMO this class is 50% linear and 50% bio (so 0% comp sci). \r\nI thought the assignments were well designed and interesting. The trajectory of the class seemed a little random and organization is definitely not a strength, but that didn't bother me personally. My main issue was the exams - I felt that they were difficult to study for and they're worth 60% of the final grade. Zucker is also unafraid to cold-call people about random general knowledge things which is slightly terrifying. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an amalgamation of CS, EE, and Biology, so if you like coding, signal processing math, and the brain, you'll get along just fine. This by no means you have to be ~good~ at all three of those things. HAH! The professor is very engaging, and he'll cold-call you so stay on your toes, but he's such an expert on these subjects that he tends to move very quickly. I found myself turning back to the lecture notes or going to office hours for real answers. The thing about the lecture notes is that they are so long for each lecture that to find the information you want, you ~have~ to do a CMD+F (Ctrl+F) \"Find\" to search for it. Having said that, if you have time to read all of the lecture notes- they are very well-written- you will excel in this course, but I guess that's a given. There's a midterm and a final (go to the review sessions) and about 6 problem sets in MATLAB. Yes, the problem sets are in MATLAB. Anyway, the material covered is fun- you learn about our visual system, how we recognize and classify objects, and then how to make a computer do the same thing. If you're interested in this stuff, take the course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in the field of computer vision but do not want to go in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in learning about visual systems. Does not help with technical skills though, besides some programming experience in Matlab. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought it was a very unique and interesting course. I loved the interdisciplinary aspects of it and think it appeals really nicely to a lot of different kinds of people and gives you the chance to combine your field of interest with others. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think it is cool as someone with a CS background to learn about the biological basis of a lot of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I struggle to answer this because the subject is SO interesting but you learn so very little in this course. Also it was just an extremely frustrating and confusing experience because there was no real clear feedback even though the TF would comment on all of our HWs. I guess it's just because we were never really taught the fundamentals of the subject well enough to be able to understand the problems we were having moving forward. Also if you can't make the TFs office hours, you're at a disadvantage because he really helps you out with the pset and the exam review at that time. Make sure you can make them! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed some of the general concepts that we learned in this course and think it is necessary for taking more advanced computer vision courses, however I would not recommend it to someone who wants to only take one computer vision course and expect to understand the field. This course is mainly a survey of math and biology, but it is not a course made for a computer scientist since not much time is spent on the application of current computer vision algorithms. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are fun (and often pretty funny), the psets aren't too bad once you get a grip on how matlab works, but the exams are wild. ",
            "\u00a0I actually think this course is a great introduction to computer vision (Im not sure why there were so many meh reviews in earlier years). Anyone with previous exposure to AI/ML will find this class easier than others will. "
