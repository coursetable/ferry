            "\u00a0Mayhew does a fantastic job of translating a lifetime of work into a comprehensive overview of our elections. While depth may be sacrificed for breadth, it is a trade-off with significant benefits for students looking to hear from Mayhew on a whole range of topics including political ideologies, partisanship, polling, performance blowback, and many more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about different parts of US history in Congress and elections, from voting populations, to constituent psychology, to voting patterns. Read works by some amazing and interesting authors, while getting to hear from the election/Congressional encyclopedia himself David Mayhew. ",
            "\u00a0An insane amount of political science. Mayhew is a genius. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about elections in a new way. Not just as standalone events, but rather as broader trends. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about congress, elections and US politics in general ",
            "\u00a0In this course I mostly learned some general knowledge about the history of US Elections and different facets through which to analyze the elections. All of this knowledge was pretty interesting and in addition, through some of the papers we read I learned some statistical methods. Data analysis was a moderate component of the class so I did learn some important statistical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Learn about the history of US national elections and the different ways to measure how representative elections are. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to analyze electoral decisions and moments in their larger historical trends. History-based evaluation is both focused on and developed. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of this course. 5 reading responses over the course of the semester with classes that were organic (with slight encouragement from Professor Mayhew for us to engage and share with the class our findings within our reading responses) made for an incredibly amazing class experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a treasure - anyone with the opportunity should take it. Grades on papers/more feedback may have been helpful. I do wish Mayhew lectured more, the discussions were often phenomenal but it also seems like a waste of Mayhew's expertise to rely so much on discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayhew is an encyclopedia of studies and theories about elections. He is the strength of the course. The readings are also very interesting. \r\n\r\nThe discussions were very much based on the readingsif you dont do the readings, you wont get much out of the course. I would also say that the course required a strong degree of history knowledge, of which I didnt have. Its hard to analyze the election of 1824 without a firm understanding of what was going on in 1824. Similarly, its hard to draw comparisons between elections if you arent familiar with them already. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayhew and the syllabus are certainly the two largest strengths of the course. The course is worth taking for Professor Mayhew and his encyclopedic knowledge of the topic alone. The very well thought out syllabus only helps the course. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course would be that there is very little transparency when it comes to grades. You receive comments on the response papers rather than grades and it is sometimes quite hard to discern from the comments how a paper was received. Nonetheless, once you get accustomed to not knowing your grade, the course is thoroughly enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion is definitely a strength. David Mayhew's knowledge base as well. No weaknesses! Maybe a little more feedback on response papers would be nice ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Mayhew is brilliant and there is no one more qualified and interesting to learn about elections from. The format is reasonable in that the reading load is okay and the 5 papers allowed the opportunity for us to explore the concepts we really liked in the syllabus with more depth. The syllabus is structured well in that it covers many interesting facets of elections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think discussion could've been a bit more formatted. I do like that we often talked about what people wrote (those who chose to write that week) in their papers, but it made the discussion feel more rambling. It might've been nice that in addition to discussing papers and jumping around, Professor Mayhew sent a sheet of what he wanted each seminar to cover a few days before each class. He sent a sheet explaining how we should analyze the readings, so taking that a step further would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Its an amazing course. You wont know your grade in it, which can be annoying, but Prof Mayhew is amazing. "

        [
            "\u00a01000% yes. This class was one of my favorites ever, and Professor Mayhew is truly a delight. He is an amazing speaker and actively encourages discussion in an organic way which was so educational. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I thought I knew a fair amount about US elections going in -- I wasn't prepared for how much I learned. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the quantitative, not qualititative, aspects of elections, take this course. The course is mostly devoid of politics or policy, its about trends and empirics. If that sounds good to you, take the course. I would also only recommend the class if you have a strong understanding of history already. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Don't pass up an opportunity to take a class with Professor Mayhew. ",
            "\u00a0YES! One of the best classes at Yale. Don't miss out on it! A must take for anyone who wants to understand the US political system ",
            "\u00a0If you're into elections and into US History, this course is a must. It's not the most profound course, but it covers great topics and is a lot of fun. Professor Mayhew is a legend in political science, so it's a privilege to have seminars with him. Take this as a 4th or 5th class, be prepared to engage with the readings and put in effort on the papers, but if you do you'll find the experience fun and rewarding. \r\n\r\nOne thing I'll note is that as I click submit I have no idea what my grade will be. We wrote 5 reaction papers which had a bunch of checks and \"well dones\" written on them and then we have participation. If that kind of thing makes you tense, don't take the class or be blunt with Professor Mayhew. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Its a great opportunity to engage with graduate students and to learn from THE authoritative voice on US national elections. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about electoral trends since the founding of the United States, this is an excellent course for that. Further, it's a great course to help delinate moments from actual trends. "
