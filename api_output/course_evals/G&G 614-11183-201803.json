            "\u00a0This course was a useful discussion and literature review of relevant and recent work in respect to biogeochemical cycles. I gained a deepened understanding of ongoing work and research in my field, gained familiarity with some new and different isotope systems, in addition to becoming more comfortable engaging in scientific discussion. "

I did wish we had more time to follow subjects through, but that may have been a byproduct of the various student research interests rather than course structure. "
