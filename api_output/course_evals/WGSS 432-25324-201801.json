            "\u00a0I learned a lot about social construction and about various important topics in our society such as race and gender. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really well set up for teaching me to engage with social ontology and other topics in contemporary philosophy, and I also learned a lot about writing papers for a philosophy seminar ",
            "\u00a0Analytic philosophy of social construction! I didn't realize that was a thing until this class. It was awesome material and needs to be taught again. It was also really great to cover some feminist epistemology along the way (e.g. Anderson's critique of 'value-free' scientific inquiry), which I also think is really important for the philosophy department to have. "

            "\u00a0I thought this class was very well-organized and that discussion was very interesting and informative. There are a few papers on the syllabus that I did not find particularly helpful, however, such as the one on achieving reference. It felt like the material in that paper was peripheral to the other things we were discussing. I would have liked to read some more classic and well-known literature related to social ontology such as the work of Michel Foucault. I also wish there had been clearer guidelines out of what was wanted from the presentations. It would have been helpful to receive a sheet of feedback about our first presentations to better guide us on what to do for our second presentations. ",
            "\u00a0the amount of reading assigned was perfect-- just enough that we were always able to engage with it in class, but not so much that we would only talk about 1/4 of what had been assigned. Very well set up! ",
            "\u00a0I only wish we had more time in seminar to talk about all the topics we covered! "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. While the undergrads were significantly outnumbered, Professor Dembroff made sure that we were able to speak and that our questions were answered. Class discussions were very interesting and lively and it seemed like everyone really cared about the issues. It was great to be able to discuss such important topics in an academic and philosophical setting. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in taking a class on social ontology and taking it seriously, I would definitely recommend it to them. Like many other things at Yale, you get out what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you're totally onboard with or totally against people saying things like 'Gender/race/sex/disability/science/reality is social construct', take this class!! I think one reason why people often disagree about statements like the above is because it's often easy to be vague about what exactly 'social construct' means -- while this class won't solve those disagreements, it'll definitely give you the language and concepts to think a lot more carefully and rigorously about what 'social construction' means. Does it mean social ideas influence physical behavior? Or does it mean that the categories we're talking about are purely social and not 'natural' or 'physical' at all? I didn't realize this stuff was studied within analytic philosophy until I took this class -- and tbh it's something sorely needed by the Yale philosophy dept as well as philosophy as a discipline. Helps too that Prof. Dembroff is a wonderful discussion facilitator and a fabulous philosopher :) "
