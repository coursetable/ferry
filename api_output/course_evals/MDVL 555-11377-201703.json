            "\u00a0Gained understanding of legal traditions in medieval europe; likewise, gained some facility with paleographic work. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the course cultivates strong bibliographic skills (which are challenging to build) and provided a base knowledge for the study of medieval law. One of the most transferrable skills is simply the ability to know how to access certain reference materials and primary sources. We also discussed how editions are made, which is important for anyone working with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0Latin palaeography.\r\nHow to use medieval law texts, terms, allegations, etc.\r\nTons of great content about medieval law\r\nHow to do research in canon law. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in paleography and textual editing as well as gaining significantly more knowledge about medieval canon law and legal theory. I also learned about the principal resources available for the study of medieval law. "

            "\u00a0The course focuses less on law in medieval europe than canon law-- either the title should be changed, or the course should integrate secular legal traditions more directly. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed that the course was able to pull together a variety of sources. From the broad secondary readings to manuscript fragments, I thought that it was helpful to see how all these different elements can be brought together to create a composite image of medieval law. I thought that the variety of assignments was very helpful. \r\n\r\nI do wish that the collaborative edition project would have been a bit expanded and the case study project reduced in size. I think that they are both excellent assignments, but I would have preferred expanding the former just a bit more. Not only was the collaborative work interesting, the chance to examine the fragments in person added an extra experiential element to the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. I learned so many skills and really discovered how to navigate the complicated world of medieval canon law texts, which is very confusing.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript project was also very fun - it helped me learn the basics of palaeography and textual editing in an exciting way.\r\n\r\nThe small size and great caliber of students also made the class extremely rewarding.\r\n\r\nThere weren't many weaknesses - this was one of my favorite courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course law lay in its practical application of paleography and editing, as we learned to make a critical edition of an unedited medieval, legal manuscript. Another strength was the discussion-based format of the class and the specialization of each member of the class on a certain research topic, the results of which we shared with each other periodically and in a final presentation. The final presentation itself was very good practice for presenting papers at conferences and sharing new research with other scholars. The main weakness of the class was the lack of time to discuss all of the reading done outside of class. An hour and 50 minutes each week was not enough time to actively engage with all of the assigned material. Overall, I felt like it was a well-designed and challenging course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I found the subject matter to be interesting and I would recommend the course widely. I especially find the bibliographic skills to be helpful in research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, if you are interested in real detailed historical work. It is not for the faint of heart, and can be very technical at times. However, it is never dry. If you are interested in the subject matter, it is a must. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of legal theory, of law in the Middle Ages, or of the history of Roman Catholic canon law, although I think that any medievalist would find the subject matter valuable, whether they are a historian, art historian or literary specialist. I would not recommend it to someone with no interest in these topics, however. "
