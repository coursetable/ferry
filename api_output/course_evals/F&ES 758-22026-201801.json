            "\u00a0The best and worst part about the class is that multiple computer programs are used. On one hand, this is great for accessibility, and allowing a variety of students to get involved. On the other hand, it is frustrating when one's selected program isn't covered for an example. That being said, I don't know how this could be improved.\r\nWhile it is nice that group work is offered, it feels like those who work alone are put at a disadvantage. Perhaps there could be an incentive for those unable to find a partner/group. ",
            "\u00a0I think the Professor himself is a strength of this course. For material is typically dry, I think he did a good job of engaging the class and making the material interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The key strength is being able to use your own data set through the course. It's a great balance between learning about the techniques in lectures and the math that the computer is doing, and then applying them to the dataset. It's a much more satisfying and easier class than Intro Stats surprisingly. The only weakness is that I wish I had received feedback on my homeworks throughout the semester - I still haven't received feedback on most of my homework - but I think there was a shortage of TAs? However, going to Jonathan directly when doing the homework is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think it this class would be much more useful to research students if taught in the fall instead of spring. While there are a lot of benefits to showing examples in multiple software platforms during the lectures, I sometimes found it hard to pay attention when the demonstration was in a program that I wasn't familiar with. The turnaround on grading assignments was very slow (3-5 weeks), and I would have really liked faster feedback on my work. ",
            "\u00a0The best part about this class is that Jonathan wants us to actually learn useful skills. It sounds trivial but I honestly don't feel that way in most other classes here at FES (and Yale broadly). This is exemplified by the fact that he lets us modify assignments to suit our needs and our data -- that means not wasting time working on a rote assignment but actually learning and understanding where and how to apply different skills. It also means more work for him and his TAs (which is probably why most professors force you to stick with slogging through fake datasets and performing memorized actions), and I really appreciate that commitment. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we could have spent more time during lecture working through interpreting the outcome of different tests and less time on the nuances of the linear algebra. I struggled the most during homework when trying to interpret the output. I do understand that the nature of multivariate statistics is less straightforward and often subjective, but I would have liked to spend more time working through those challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I find it is a great course. I don't see any need to improve. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - Professor's teaching was lively and excellent.\r\nWeakeness - Too fast ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good combination of theory and hand-on skills, and lectures were well-organized. It was also video-recorded so I could review the knowledge afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussed more the technical side of making calculations with limited discussion on actually interpreting them. More discussion on interpretation would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is flexible. I think it will be better if the lecture could focus more on examples rather than mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that homework assignments related well to subject material and cemented my knowledge on the topic. Weaknesses were again I didn't always feel like I knew what the significance of the outputs of our analyses. Also, homework assignments were handed back very late so it was hard to gauge how well I was doing in the class and what I needed to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I love how the class is video-taped, and therefore I could watch the streaming anywhere anytime I want. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - engaging lectures, appreciated that they were also recorded.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - actually wish that we went more into the proofs and had some exams/tests to make sure we understood the underpinning of the techniques. Not sure I understand when it is and is not appropriate to use certain techniques. ",
