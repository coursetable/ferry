The course focused on how to build a set of financial statements and the crucial differences between economic and accounting valuations. Accounting 270 will payoff long into the future for me. ",
            "\u00a0Although I learned a lot from this course, I would have learned much more if the course a better structured in a way that the quizzes and homework actually reflected the this we were leaning in class. Rick is such a great person, but most of what I've learned was because I attended to most of the office hours. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Antle is by far the greatest strength. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think you could improve the course by assigning one assignment a week that covers both lectures on like a Friday after the concepts have been taught. Having two assignments due a week was a bit fatiguing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and covered a major part of business and finance that I haven't learned at Yale or my previous internships. I loved taking the course and look forward to using what I learned in the future. However, I wish homework was graded quicker and I could see the responses to my homework. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't learn in class what we were required in the HM and quizzes. That made me spend so much timing trying to understand what kind of information I had to apply and where to get the information from. Rick didn't corrected our HM and gave us the answers, so it was impossible to know what we were doing wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Really poor organization; lost any sense of high level concepts to the specifics of inputting into the proper excel columns/formats.\r\nWould suggest a refocus on key takeaways of accounting and get out of the ExPrep/excel system. ",
            "\u00a0SOM 845 is brutal... ",
            "\u00a0Rick is a great guy, but there is a great disconnect between lessons and homework.  That, and daily homework seems like it is almost optional.  I think it could be greatly improved by giving feedback on homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course, and it could potentially move forward even faster to cover more material. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice to have the homework be more doable and count towards the final grade! ",
            "\u00a0I think actually less weekly assignments and more psets would be helpful. I did not learn through the weekly assignments but the psets really helped me solidify my learning. I viewed the weekly assignments (especially because it was graded on completion) as busy work and the psets as actual assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that Professor Antle is very approachable and is highly passionate about the course material and the class itself. The material was also challenging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Need more multiple choice easy assignments to supplement the harder ones. let us get some mental repetition. ",
            "\u00a0It did a good job of giving me general idea of accounting. I think the homework is a little unrealistically long. Also I dont like how this is a flipped class. Some homework assignments I didnt know how to even start. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves quite slowly, which is great because the students have plenty of time to become familiar with the concepts. the homework assignments are not graded and students get credit just for completing them. The emphasis in the class is very much on learning and not how performance. A weakness of the class was that often the lectures fell behind the homework schedule, so we were assigned to do homeworks on subjects that we hadn't learned yet. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: instructor\r\nWeakness: pacing -- sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that you (eventually) learn the basics of accounting. The weakness are how unorganized the class is and how useless lectures and homework were. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: very organized, office hours frequent, TFs were incredibly helpful, Professor Antle is incredible\r\nWeaknesses: due dates for things were very unclear, grading for everything (except the final) seemed arbitrary at best, the whole ExPrep thing (online submission and grading of Excel problem sets) had tons of technical errors and I hope it is not used in future versions of the course ",
            "\u00a0I think Rick's a great engaging teacher and agree that practice is the only way to learn it. I would have benefitted from more assignments and more time with the TAs to go over the material "

            "\u00a0I would since the workload is very light and you learn helpful accounting techniques. I did not find the textbook helpful, so it was better to go the TAs or Prof. Antle to clear anything up. ",

That said, it was definitely a very pleasant experience given a dull topic and the professor really tries to make it as interesting and engaging as possible. ",

            "\u00a0Yes - accounting and valuation are extremely important skills for the corporate world. ",
            "\u00a0100% Yes! This is a great class to get a good introduction to accounting and valuation. If you are interested in entering investment banking and/or consulting (which statistically is almost half of Yale undergrads), this is an essential class. Yes, in the corporate world there are training programs that teach you these topics too, but all of your co-workers in those training programs will have had accounting/finance exposure  taking this class (and actually paying attention) will help level the playing field for you.
