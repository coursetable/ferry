            "\u00a0Development of key phases in Neo-Assyrian history and an exploration of important themes within that history. The reading of a number of primary sources in translation was also helpful in gaining a good familiarity with the textual sources used in constructing that history. ",
            "\u00a0I could earn a fundamental knowledge of history and culture of the Neo-Assyrian empire, taking a close look at various issues such as Assyria's aggressive foreign policy, the reconstruction of Assyrian royal history, legendary woman figures in Assyrian palace and Assyrian influence on the Bible. Reading primary sources in translation as well as secondary literature, I also learned to critically approach and analyze the primary sources, which is one of the most interesting parts of this course. In class, we read the introduction of Neo-Assyrian history and discussed it in chronological order, which was helpful in having a firm understanding of the entire history and literature of the Neo-Assyrian period. "

            "\u00a0The readings and lectures were very good. Since the course is called \"Assyria, the first empire\" I think the course would benefit from returning to the discussion of empire on multiple occasions, or linking other themes discussed back to the theme of empire. We did discuss the definition of \"empire\", but additional links back to that discussion at other points in the course might help to pull the various threads together. ",
            "\u00a0Not only does the course cover most of the important historical events in the Neo-Assyrian period, but it also provides an opportunity to reconstruct the history based on the analysis of primary sources. It is convenient that all the materials are uploaded to the website. However, it would have been better if we had had more time to discuss each topic every week. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It does greatly help if the student already has some familiarity with the ancient near east, but it does not require specialist knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. From this course, you can earn a fundamental knowledge of history, culture, and literature of the Neo-Assyrian empire. Reading primary sources in translation as well as secondary literature, you can also learn to critically approach and analyze the primary sources. "
