            "\u00a0I learned the principles of and how to conceptualize clients from a DBT, couples, and family therapy perspective. Furthermore, I deepened my understanding of pacing and planning treatment to meet the needs of the client. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conceptualize and administer psychotherapy from family-focused, DBT, and couples therapy-oriented approaches. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a solid introduction to dialectical behavior therapy, several couples therapy techniques, and several family therapy techniques. I developed a strong theoretical understanding of these approaches, and had many opportunities to practice implementing each technique. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided both a broad and deep introduction to fundamental psychotherapy orientations. I learned a combination of theory and practice to build a strong knowledge foundation for clinical work. This course was expertly structured to foster clinical skill development in line with DBT, family therapy, and couples therapy. I believe I have stronger clinical skills and insight into the theoretical (and empirical where appropriate) basis supporting these psychotherapy orientations. I also furthered my knowledge of developing flexible conceptualizations across different orientations. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how we were able to practice and role play techniques based on our readings! ",
            "\u00a0This course allows for clear learning and understanding of each of the orientations presented. The readings were clear and helpful, and doing roleplays in class is extremely helpful for learning how to administer therapy. I thought that the Gottman videos were less helpful than other readings but otherwise enjoyed all aspects of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe opportunities to practice each skill in class was a big strength of this course (and fun and helpful!)\r\nI especially enjoyed learning about couples and family therapy, and discussing challenges/differences with these types of therapy vs. individual therapy \r\n\r\nNot really weaknesses, just comments: I found the Gottman readings much more helpful than the Gottman tapes. The tapes weren't very engaging and it was much more helpful reading/practicing in class in terms of understanding their approach. I also would have preferred a little more time on couples and family therapy and a little less time on DBT, though I also realize that this might be impossible since there is so much material to cover with DBT! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: classroom environment, skill building activities, discussions, reading material, pacing of material, instructor feedback \r\nWeakness: more videos debriefing how to implement clinical skills (e.g., DBT videos were amazing! the other areas did not have as strong video options) would be helpful "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student - I felt that I really learned how to take into account clients' individual differences when conceptualizing problems. I also felt that the material and class structure complemented each other very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great and informative course, and I learned many valuable skills that I feel comfortable incorporating into clinical work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course content, in-class discussions, and assignments has an excellent synergy for real-world clinical work. Learning this with Mary was an invaluable experience and provided me with the confidence needed to begin clinical work. "
