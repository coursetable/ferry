            "\u00a0I was able to develop a greater awareness for the history of Black Girls in American Cities. I learned that sometimes you have to write yourself into the story. I learned that those marginalized aren't always given a voice. ",
            "\u00a0General understanding of black feminist theory, some historical context, ability to read academic sociology texts ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me the framework and foundation to understand the experiences of black girls like myself. It provided historical context and contemporary viewpoints on black girls in American cities. It also taught me a lot about what it means to grow up as a black girl and showed me how my own personal experiences connect to the larger population of black girls. ",
            "\u00a0I received a variety of different theories, research, literature, and modern day examples to create a framework through which to view black girlhood in America. It made me feel sane in giving a name to things I've been feeling my entire life and a sense of grounding in discovering who I am. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in writing an annotating bibliography and discussing  complex texts ",
            "\u00a0I was able to connect my everyday experience with historical backing that gives insight into the treatment of black girls and women. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to close read, efficiently make connections between texts, and to name and theorize things that happen in my daily life and the daily lives of those like me. I learned how to incorporate relaxation into my work, by meditating before class, deep breathing, and giving myself time to re-focus and center before investing in my class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained extensive knowledge about the history of black women in America, the struggles that we've faced, and the steps needed to move forward. This was a very inspiring course that instilled a lot of self-love and confidence in me that I didn't have before. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding and familiarity with the authors and pioneers of black feminism. I have learned to think strategically about intersexionality in everyday life and the knowledge I have gained from this class has helped give me context for many of the racial dynamics seen in society today. ",
            "\u00a0This class really opened my eyes in a variety of ways. It helped me to learn to look beyond surface information and connect the dots. It also improved my analysis skills and improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the creation and various aspects of black feminist thought and the work all over the U.S that is being conducted by black feminists. "

            "\u00a0All of the readings assigned were fascinating and very relevant to the course matter, which increased our understanding and sparked wonderful class discussions. At times, though, we weren't able to talk about all that we had read, so I wonder if perhaps slightly less reading might mean future classes can really dig into the sources they are reading rather than only touching the surface in class at times. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cox is very friendly and approachable, and she knows how to relate to students. The course is definitely unique, and very few courses have been taught in the vein of black girl studies. However, I found the readings to be vague and uninteresting, using overly complicated academic jargon to convey in a hundred pages what could have been said in five. The course is pretty disorganizedwhich makes sense, given that it's the first time it's being taughtbut Professor Cox's lectures are sometimes hard to follow, and I'm not sure what the main idea of her presentations are, even after she's given them. We learned lots of terminology and concepts, but at the end of the day, not much of any substance. I liked the freedom we were given on the final paper assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was very strong. Our class discussions were always stimulating and topics were interesting. Sometimes, the readings felt a little long and abstract and we didn't always talk about them to clarify what it was about. In addition, some classes were heavily dominated by the professor talking instead of it being more conversational and seminar style. But, the issues that were raised were extremely important and relevant and personal. The course at times lacked direction so to improve it, I would just reevaluate the syllabus so that you have enough time to focus on what's important and aren't rushing through things. ",
            "\u00a0I think every black girl at Yale should have the opportunity to take this class, especially as a first year. Professor Cox also has amazing connections and brought in some really great people to speak to us. I think a weakness of the class is that we spent so long on theory, although very important, that we didn't get to apply it to our lives and modern day as much as I would've liked to. I also wish we were able to read more literature and afro-futurism pieces like we did towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: improves public speaking skills; makes you think deeply\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time to effectively discuss all texts ",
            "\u00a0I think the material for the class was enjoyable, but there needed to be more room for discussion among students. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so engaging and still respects the desire to be silent. It was diverse in approach and interested in the various perspectives of the many black girls that were in the class. The class felt more like a bond between young women and men, discussing important issues rather than a regular class. I enjoyed this class from start to finish. ",
            "\u00a0Fun in-class activities and writing prompts. The readings at the beginning of the course were a little repetitive and uninteresting, but they were full of necessary knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very engaging and puts in a lot of effort to make the classroom activities exciting for her students. Some of the readings become repetitive and there are times when we read for class and never get the opportunity to discuss the content. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class could be improved by decreasing the number of readings in order to allow for adequate time to fully examine each reading. "

            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a transformative experience that I'll never forget. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe take it if you know you have a strong interest in sociology/feminist theory. However, in general, I wouldn't recommend the course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Everyone should take this class or an African american studies class in general. Its not just geared towards people of the African diaspora. It was fruitful for me as a black woman and as a student looking to learn about the world shes living in. We all need to gain more perspective about the world and this class does this in such a fruitful, thoughtful, and engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly recommend for black girls entering Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It equips you with tools to engage in constructive and forward dialogue about black feminism and race as it stands in the U.S. "
