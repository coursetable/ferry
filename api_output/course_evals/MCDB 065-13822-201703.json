            "\u00a0As the title indicates, you learn a lot about the science and politics of HIV/AIDS and global health, leaning more on the science side. ",
            "\u00a0The history of the HIV epidemic, the virology of HIV, and the cultural ramifications of HIV ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class knowing very little about the disease itself and about the impact that it has had in the United States and beyond. Now, I would say that I have gained a plethora of knowledge not just about the disease, but about everything related to the disease. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course, I learned about public/global health and how a disease that may seem very biological like HIV is actually a very social disease that can be viewed from many different perspectives to learn more about combatting diseases in the future. We learned about the epidemiology, the biology, the situation in different countries, the history in America, the search for cures and medicine and vaccines, and the current efforts to fight it still. From our independent final research project Wikipedia paper, I also learned a lot about my own topic, which is about the HIV/AIDS situation in a particular country. ",
            "\u00a0I developed immense insight into the issues - political, social, biological, and other - surrounding the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the past, present, and future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about political and cultural issues that currently and historically have surrounded the HIV/AIDS illness in the US and throughout the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the very complex history, politics, and science surrounding HIV/AIDS. We covered a lot of material, starting from the origins of the disease to how countries all over the world are dealing with the disease now. I thought that most of the material was very interesting ",
            "\u00a0I acquired a lot of knowledge surround the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its effects not only on individuals, but the entire world on an economic, political, scientific, and social basis. Through this class, I got more experience with extracting information from readings to form my own opinions and researching to write a nonbias article for Wikipedia. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's an interesting topic, especially if you're interested in pre-med or global health. It's a very easy science credit, and the quizzes are open-note/open-laptop, which is vital because of the structure of the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a frustrating course, due to many factors. At times, it seems like the material covered is very redundant to the class before, and there were an overwhelming amount of readings at times. And many classes were just us getting up in groups to talk about the readings instead of learning new material and could be very boring. ",
            "\u00a0More media! There are definitely too many readings some nights ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very good, especially being a freshman seminar where the students are just becoming accustomed to college life. The challenge of the course is enough to stay intellectually stimulated, but it is not overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0The strength about the course is that it is very flexible and structured in a way that covered many different topics regarding the HIV epidemic worldwide while allowing us to discuss and talk about the readings every class so that we can not only learn from sources but also each other. I also really like the watching of Professor Bazell's news clips, as they offer insight on the past and the way the epidemic was seen by the media and the nation back when the epidemic first started. One weakness of the class is that it jumps around a bit and isn't the most structured in a organized way. Also, sometimes there are 3 readings, while other times there are like 30 readings for one night and not all of them, especially the papers, can be discussed in a way that allows us to fully understand all the information that is in them. I, however, did really like the way Professor Bazell incorporated different types of sources like papers, articles, news, videos, and movies for us to learn and also invited speakers that were relevant during the epidemic to talk about the point of view back then and how global health and public health has evolved over the years and the future of the topic of HIV. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its focus on student discussion and learning rather than assessment of any form, although the few assessments that we did have were appreciated so that we understood whether or not we comprehended the material we were learning. I also greatly appreciated the Wikipedia article as the final product, as it gave us a chance to display our knowledge to a much wider audience than just our peers and our professor. ",
            "\u00a0More structure to the class ",
            "\u00a0I think that a strength of this course is how much professor Bazell knew about this subject, and his experience reporting on it for many years. It was great to hear about his personal insight regarding a lot of the topics. The subject matter is also very interesting, and I learned a lot of new things that I wasn't aware of before, which is another strength of this class. Another strength are all the class guests that we got to have throughout the duration of the course. I also liked the NBC videos of his that he would use to supplement some of the material we were learning in class. However, one of the weakness is that this class seemed a bit disorganized at times, and the syllabus changed a lot. Also, I would've liked to receive more feedback about what I was doing well in class and what I can do to improve. I would've liked to know exactly what was expected of me from the beginning. Also another weakness is that sometimes there would be long lists of readings that we would have to do but we wouldn't have time to discuss them. But, overall, the workload was fair and most readings were relevant and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Because this class was a new seminar in the Fall semester, it was a bit difficult to see the structure and formality in the class. For some assignments, it was hard for me to see the purpose in it. Sometimes the readings felt redundant. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, simply because it's an easy science credit, even if you're not a STEM person. I didn't enjoy it, but others in the class really did, so it depends on the student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's definitely interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to someone else. Professor Bazell is great and the material is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would indeed recommend this course to another student because it really is a different type of course that you seldom get in college. The small seminar style is also really comfortable because you get more of a chance to speak up and get to know your fellow classmates who come from different interests and fields but all have the common curiosity regarding the topic of HIV. The workload is also not as high as for other courses and its mostly reading so that you can engage in the conversations during class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the intersection of medicine and politics. Its an extremely interesting course, and the class discussions we have are very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, i would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Overall, I thought it was a good course. I liked the class guests that came in to talk first hand about their involvement with HIV/AIDS and I also liked the NBC clips that Professor Bazell would should us. But there were times were professor Bazell would assign a ton of readings for a class, which was a bit annoying, especially because we wouldn't even have time to discuss most of them. Also, the  expectations for this course weren't that clear and I would've liked more feedback. But overall, the workload was fair, and the material was interesting so I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0If the course makes adjustments and changes I think it is a very great seminar. Not many people know the magnitude to which HIV/AIDS shaped public policy in the US and abroad. The readings were very interesting and I think it was especially unique because of the role that our professor played during the course of the epidemic so we heard amazing stories and details behind the readings we did in class.
