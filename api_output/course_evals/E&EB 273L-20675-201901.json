            "\u00a0Learned so much about bird diversity and how to identify different families of birds. Great complement to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about classification, ontology, philosophy of science, and of course birds. It gave me lots of new things to think about in relation to my interests in the material world and humans' relationship to it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the ecology of about 150 families of  birds, and I learned to identify them from specimens in the Peabody's collection. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the birds of the world!! I gained insight into the biology and physiology about all of the different major groups of birds, and I am much more proficient with bird identification. I also feel that I have come away from this class with a greater appreciation for biodiversity and heightened awareness of birds. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of bird names. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the common and scientific names of the bird families of the world as well as how to recognize and identify them. Additionally, I learned about various birds' breeding and nesting biology, range, diet, and other ecological information. I also learned a lot about phylogenetic classification. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Well organised and structured. 30 minutes of lecture followed by as much time as you wanted to look at the birds. Quizzes every week but not for a grade so you have a way to test your knowledge each week, which keeps you from slipping as there is a lot to know. The only thing I would improve would maybe be more availability for review times since the only real way to review is by looking at the birds themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. Professor Prum is wonderful, his lectures are interesting and filled with passion. It was a pure joy to learn ornithology from someone who is not only one of the most renowned researchers in the field, but who also loves the material as much as he did. I learned a ton about birds, and highly recommend the lab to anyone who is interested in taking it.\r\n\r\nFair warning, the lab is a lot of work. Despite being only half a credit it is highly memorisation intense (again, the material is learning about the ecology of 150 bird families and being able to identify them, and only that). Also, it is a big advantage to have done some birding before and have a vague sense of species identification. I am not an intense birder, but we do enough birdwatching on family vacations that I am decent, and that I had some background in identifying birds which made a big difference.\r\n\r\nAlong with the  lecture, this was far and away my favourite class I took this semester, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is considering it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the weekly quizzes provided a low-stress incentive to stay on top of the material. A weakness is that they could have reflected the material that was on the final better - I was not expecting so many questions on geographic range. \r\nAnother strength is that it was so fun!! A weakness is that I don't know how applicable this will be in life hahah. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really awesome! I love how experiential and hands-on it was. I think it could be improved by making the natural history/physiology/biology information covered in the lab lectures available on canvas. ",
            "\u00a0If you are genuinely interested in learning about birds then this lab offers a great opportunity to be up close with species you otherwise may never see. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you're willing to put in the time to memorise things, which isn't that hard, and are willing to show up to class, then take this course. It is a great complement to the lecture and you learn so so much about birds and Prof. Prum is just such an amazing guy so more time with him is always a plus. Also, as in the lecture, you get knowledge of the big debates in evolutionary biology, and the philosophy of science in general, which is something you really won't get from any other science class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This is a really spectacular opportunity to examine the collections of the Peabody under the instruction of someone who really knows the birds. ",
            "\u00a0YES DEFINITELY YES YES YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I looked forward to it every week and it has caused me to see the natural world, especially birds, with new wonder. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend!! Such a cool class, very experiential, and you will get to work with specimens that are really unique to Yale. If you take the ornithology lecture without taking this class you are missing out on an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you are genuinely interested in learning about birds then this lab offers a great opportunity to be up close with species you otherwise may never see. ",
            "\u00a0Ornithology Lab is a class that anyone interested in the natural world (not just birds!) should take. Learning how to identify the birds of the world is not just a fun trick, but it also teaches you how to think differently about the world around you. Professor Prum is a great professor with intimate knowledge of all the birds he discusses, and his passion for the subject is quite inspiring. "
