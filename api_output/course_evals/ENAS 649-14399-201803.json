The only suggestion (I would not call it a weakness) I would make is that sometimes the PhD problems were extremely long and too challenging. I am a PhD student and I am not opposed to challenging homework problems (in fact, I usually like them), but in many cases I felt that my background was not adequate for the PhD problems and I ended up having to try to learn an entire branch of research/statistics/modeling just to answer part of a question. I didn't feel like the lectures prepared me for the PhD problems. ",
