            "\u00a0I learned so much about the intersection of politics, literature, philosophy and history in the context of tyranny. I felt like I really became a humanist in this class -- looking at tough questions from all of these diverse angles and disciplines. My writing got better, and my reading got much better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of 20th century tyranny in Europe through the lens of literature. In class, we discussed questions related to power, control, morality and responsibility, and engaged with how authors, poets and philosophers grappled with tyranny of their era. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to engage with a wide variety of texts grounded in historical events and to draw connections between seemingly disparate works. I also learned to manage a demanding reading load. ",
            "\u00a0introduced to new texts! ",
            "\u00a0This class really tested my grasp of philosophy, political theory, and other forms of literature that I do not often interact with as an English major. I felt particularly on my final paper that I wrote about ideas and theories more than I would in a normal English seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a fairly comprehensive overview of the political side of European intellectual history in the first half of the 20th century. The readings were wide-ranging, from novels to manifestos to political speeches, and though the course explicitly didn't aim to provide a historical overview of the time period, I did emerge with a far deeper understanding of the major ideological threads from the era considered. ",
            "\u00a0How to find commonalities between a diversity of readings; how to understand an unbelievable period of modern history through its literature and writings; how to synthesize complex ideas and then articulate and defend them to a group ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a basic grasp of American, French, and British literature in opposition to totalitarian systems from the 1920s through the 40s. I learned how the exigencies of the political environment altered traditional genres and led to the formation of subgenres such as the roman a these. "

            "\u00a0A lot of reading! But mostly all worth it. Not much I would change. Kaplan and Bromwich both offered incredible insight. I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A breathtaking range of texts we read, spanning genres and disciplines, from speeches and poems, to novels and film. A truly holistic way of understanding and reading about tyranny in the 20th Century. Also, working through and with these texts Professor Bromwich and Professor Kaplan was especially enriching. I learned a lot from their knowledge and experiences of engaging with these works. \r\nWeaknesses: The class size was perhaps 5 people too large, and as such, it felt less intimate than it could have. ",
            "\u00a0This course and both of its instructors were excellent. We read both popular, well-known works and lesser known works, which I enjoyed. Both professors clearly know an enormous amount about the subject matter, but the teaching (and syllabus) could have been shared better. I would have liked to see slightly more discussion and at times a more cohesive reading list. Often there was more assigned than we could ever discuss in one class, and many of the readings did not obviously connect until we discussed them, so I felt like some connections were lost by that overburdening. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths include the style of teaching and the well-compiled set of readings. It's greatest weakness was its disorganization, especially in what was expected from students for the two papers. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: interesting readings, very smart professors \r\n\r\nweaknesses: connections between weeks of reading was sometimes confusing; often, the context around certain books (both historical and biographical) felt a bit scant. often, too much reading than we actually had time to discuss--it would have been nice to have a way to respond to the readings, especially with so many people in the class and the lecture sections at the beginning ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings (and pairings of readings), brilliant profs\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think there was too much reading, but I think it would have been useful for us to know in advance what we would focus on each class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class clearly were the professors and the syllabus. Professors Kaplan and Bromwich led an engaging section that split time well between historical background and group discussion. The readings were lengthy and at times difficult, but they spanned a wide breadth of genres, nationalities, and opinions. One weakness was the large size of the seminar, but it was never a burden. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone in the class was very engaged with the material, and professors Bromwich and Kaplan are both incredibly knowledgable and adept at providing context and analysis of what we read. The amount of reading was a blessing and a curse, as it was rather rare you could do all of the reading assigned in a given week (or that we talked about everything assigned in class), but the breadth of the readings was great. The major weaknesses of the course were I think all related to the classroom dynamic: Professor Bromwich dominated class discussions over both the students in the class and Professor Kaplan, making it very difficult to ever have seminar-style discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredible. Alice Kaplan and David Bromwich are the best of the best. Their syllabus is dense and overwhelming to get through each week, but the rewards are worth it. I do however wish the seminar was smallerhaving such a big bunch made individual attention difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course, I think, is its interdisciplinary approach. By incorporating political screeds, speeches, philosophical tracts, and other non-literary texts, the course allowed me to understand the mythos of the age. Reading Elizabeth Bowen's short stories in conjunction with Churchill's speeches, for example, endowed the former with the gravity and steely determination of the latter. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course was the great disparity between the number of texts assigned and the number of texts covered. For a seminar that met once a week for two hours, assigning hundreds of pages ensured that our discussions often either completely ignored certain texts or were too cursory to attain a deep understanding of them. To illustrate this point, I would say that one of the best classes was when we spent over half the time discussing The Quiet American, because during that time we were able to have a rigorous discussion of the differences between Fowler and Pyle and Greene's characterization of American involvement in Vietnam. Although I loved the texts that we read and understand the difficulty of crafting a syllabus that is not overly narrow in focus, I would recommend cutting the reading list in half. ",
            "\u00a0David Bromwich and Alice Kaplan know SO MUCH. Unfortunately, together they know too much for a single once a week seminar, so the class felt overcrowded and they both had to compete for time to talk. The topic was sort of vague and never really clearly defined, which made it difficult, and conversations leaned heavily towards the political, which was difficult for those coming in with more of a lit background. Also the class was huge, so it wasn't great for a seminar format. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Incredible syllabus with incredible teachers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in tyranny through the lens of literature, this course provides a comprehensive exposure to tyranny in the 20th century and how historical events drove art, speech, literature and film. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Interesting and topical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it for the profs and for the readings. The syllabus had a lot of material I wasn't familiar with but am glad I got to read. The downside is that the discussion wasn't great from time to time, probably because we had too much reading and often weren't told in advance what we would focus on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would surely recommend this class to others, particularly those interested in interdisciplinary studies. The reading can be daunting if left until the last minute, but the lively discussions made you want to read and participate. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with some significant caveats. Do not take the course if you are looking for a balanced, student-centric discussion-style seminar. This course really did feel like a lecture much of the time, and when students did speak their comments were directed at Professor Bromwich, who would vocally agree or disagree with almost every comment immediately after it was said. I wish Professor Kaplan was able to lead discussions more, as she didn't get nearly half of the airtime and was a far better discussion leader. However, I learned a lot in this course and it was definitely an intellectual challenge. The readings were, for the most part, really wonderful, and credit to the professors for keeping the class engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Do it. The profs are too good not to. It's so much reading but it's also the best works on tyranny and totalitarianism you could ask for in an English class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in 20th century literature or the intersection between literature and politics. Few other classes cover the texts that we read, and discussing them in a interdisciplinary setting involving students of different majors and interests was compelling. I would warn prospective students that the course requires a lot of out-of-class time to make connections between texts that are not made in class. Notwithstanding the necessity of doing so, I would encourage students interested in modern literature to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0It's not terrible, and you need it for the humanities major. That said, I really felt like Professors Bromwich and Kaplan are incredible assets and were sort of misused in this situation. They are both incredible teachers, but this format really didn't give them justice. "
