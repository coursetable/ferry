            "\u00a0We focused on several different locations around the world, during several different time periods and studied several different diseases. We we would focus a lot of different vulnerable communities that have faced oppression and discrimination as well as looked at case studies with regard to the link between race and disease. ",

            "\u00a0In Race & Disease in American Medicine, I learned how to critically analyze the construction of disease in relation to race. I learned how race is both explicit and implicitly involved in diagnosis and treatment paradigms, and is often times discussed in relation to socioeconomic status. Most importantly, I better understand the current processes that lead to and exacerbate health inequities. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I enjoyed how structured it was. We were aware of what we were doing each week, with readings and questions. the guidance was fantastic. \r\nWeaknesses: I would've liked to hear/see more enthusiasm from the professor. I feel that she has a lot of knowledge about this topic and I wouldve been able to pay attention more if there was more of a visible enthusiasm/love for what she is saying. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material was extremely interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Abedin as she was not good at facilitating conversion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quite organized class & discussion sessions, fair amount of reading, Prof. Abedin is supportive and knowledgeable about the subject\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In two sessions, Prof. Abedin provided comments on historic writing. It would be great if there would be more of these comments/recommendations that would help within & beyond the course ",
            "\u00a0The course engaged with a lot of interesting readings. \r\n\r\n\r\nI feel that a lot of younger students don't come in with enough background information on the history of race and disease, and I think that some more background could be helpful. \r\nAdditionally, I feel like having discussion posts or reading questions due before class would really, really speed up the in-class conversation and make things flow a lot more smoothly.\r\nFinally, the class should not have writing assignments due at the beginning of class that day. No one will truly do the readings if that is the case, and everyone will be exhausted from completing the assignment the night before. Ideally we'd be good enough students to do the readings and not procrastinate, but we truly aren't. It's really not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that it is a super important topic that needs to be studied more and that we had fascinating readings. However, the weaknesses of the course were that our assignments didn't seem to relate to what we were studying very well, our assignments were vague and we weren't given any guidance if at all as to how to do them, and our class discussions were very dry and unfruitful as usually the same 5 people out of a class of 15 would talk and often they would talk past each other rather than engage with each other without much guidance from Professor Abedin. ",
            "\u00a0For some of the assignments like the primary source analysis, I felt like I was kind of being thrown in the dark and left to figure out how to complete the assignment. The suggested questions for the assignment were helpful but weren't when I saw what was expected on a broader level. Class discussions felt like they did not flow and quickly became a value-signaling ordeal. I honestly had no idea what I had in the class as I was writing the final paper and have no idea for how strictly it will be graded, which is extremely stressful. I loved the readings, however, and did enjoy getting feedback for my assignments very soon, even though Prof. Abedin was very busy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings were very engaging!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times the discussions felt like they lacked focus, as there was so much reading we covered. It felt much more cohesive when we had multiple chapters from the same author. ",
            "\u00a0Great selection of readings, spent two weeks on tuberculosis which was fine, but perhaps I would have preferred to dedicate that week to another topic; enjoyed the circulation of questions, but perhaps questions could be posted on Canvas instead of distributed in class ",
            "\u00a0Course content is fascinating. Readings are largely very interesting and the syllabus is well structured. Discussions we're often interesting but sometimes became stagnant or were difficult to engage with (perhaps a product of the 9am start time). "

            "\u00a0If you are an HSHM major interested in the link between race and disease - take this. \r\nIf you are planning to study public health or go to grad school for public health - take this.\r\nBe prepared for around 200 pages of reading and reading questions for each week including a couple papers and a presentation throughout the semester. If you are looking for an upbeat seminar with a lot of energy and expression, this one isnt for you. ",
            "\u00a0yes. even if you aren't interested in a career in this field, you can get some good talking points for when people try to deny the huge effect race has on well-being and health in this nation both historically and presently. ",
            "\u00a0No, because while I think the material was very interesting I did not I don' think Professor Abedin did a good job teaching the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Students from the Humanities and Medical scietists must be aware of much of what we learned in class ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that it is a super important topic that needs to be studied more and that we had fascinating readings. I learned how to think about race critically in the fields of science and medicine in the U.S. So if you have any interest in understanding that intersection, definitely take the course! However, the main weakness of the course was that our class discussions were very dry and unfruitful as usually the same 5 people out of a class of 15 would talk and often they would talk past each other rather than engage with each other without much guidance from Professor Abedin. That might be the result of just who was in our class, the fact that many HSHM majors are pre-med and not super into history, and that Professor Abedin was a little too into student-led discussions, even when the students were failing to truly take charge. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great, and Professor Abedin is a valuable source of knowledge and insight, but I overall did not enjoy my class experience and would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student interested in learning about medicine, humanity, and health disparities. While I would argue that this should be a mandated course for all pre-med students, I know that the discussions will be hindered if students aren't truly passionate about social justice. If taken seriously, is a course that will inspire you to want to correct the medical system. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Prof. Abedin is approachable and very sweet; need to be able to speak up and voice your thoughts though, readings were great so actually don't forget to take notes and read them "
