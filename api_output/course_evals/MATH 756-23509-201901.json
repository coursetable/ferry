            "\u00a0The course was an introductory research seminar in hyperbolic geodesics and Teichmuller space. ",

            "\u00a0The course occasionally felt like it was alternating between dual purposes: an introductory course in these topics and a research seminar with the professors graduate students. This meant that the level of difficulty of the individual lectures varied a bit, with me as an undergraduate able to follow some much more easily than others. \r\n\r\nCaglar is a very good lecturer, with a very good understanding of the material and an organized, generally coherent presentation style. The graduate students presentations I generally found harder to follow than lectures by the professor. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in topology and geometry. You'll learn more if you do the readings outside of class, and if you have adequate preparation in hyperbolic geometry. "
