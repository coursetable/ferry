            "\u00a0I learned numerical methods for differential equations (ODE's and PDE's) just as the title of the class suggests. ",
            "\u00a0The objective of the course is to learn about numerical methods to solve differential equations, and to understand the nuances of each method. These objectives were definitely met. I can confidently say that I learned enough to implement it in my own research or to understand the numerical methods used by other researchers. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the instructor, Dr. Bennett. This is the most organized course I have taken, and Dr. Bennett's lectures were certainly a joy to listen to. I have previously believed that a lecture format was not the most productive way to learn but seeing how well Dr. Bennett give her lectures have changed my mind.\r\n\r\nMy single critic of this course relates to the programming task assigned in homeworks. I often felt restricted in how to solve or implement a solution. The homework instructions and lecture material were very detailed in how to implement a solution and I felt that this was too much hand-holding. Even if there is an optimal solution, I would have rather fidgeted around to arrive at that solution than to be given it. ",

I am not yet sure if the material will be immediately relevant to my research, but if it is one day I will feel comfortable choosing and applying one of the numerical methods to a differential equation! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Bennett is extremely organized and on top of everything. The course is very well taught and you will learn a lot. That being said, it's also lots of work, but definitely worth it. ",
