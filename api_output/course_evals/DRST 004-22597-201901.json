            "\u00a0This course gave me a really goo foundational understanding of modern western philosophy. I really feel confident in taking more philosophy classes now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about generations of philosophical thought, modern philosophy ideas, how to craft my own ideas and argue for them effectively, how to understand arguments and try to pick them apart, or put them together, and how to write philosophy. This course covered a lot and I was very happy to have taken it! ",
            "\u00a0A true appreciation for modern philosophy and for philosophical engagement.  Our discussion were lively and engaging.  I hope to continue taking some philosophy courses at Yale as a result of this course.  I developed my analytical reading skills immensely as well, thanks in part to Prof. Winkler's teaching style and willingness to engage with students. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a significant amount of knowledge in modern philosophical thought. More importantly, however, is the development of my argumentative capacity, both in presentation (papers) and in analysis while reading the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Writing philosophy papers ",
            "\u00a0Philosophy has become my new favorite subject after taking this course. I learned how to read philosophy, ask philosophical questions with peers, and apply those principles to everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Lots about the transitions and development of ideas in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Compare and contrast different philosophies (Kant vs Hume, etc.), all in all understand the most influential philosophers of the post Greco-Roman Judeo-Christian eras, different concepts of the material world, different concepts and proofs of God, different moral frameworks ",
            "\u00a0You'll gain a broad understanding of a great many philosophical systems and be able to note some interesting connections (and conflicts) between them. That's all well and good -- but the really fundamental contribution of this course is the mental rigor arguing about philosophy builds. Philosophy is a way of thought, disciplined, powerful, and applicable to any discipline. "

            "\u00a0I feel it is a very strong and well organized class. The reading assignments are logical if sometimes a little heavy, but that is hard to avoid. I believe I have learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It was great class. The syllabus was excellent, discussion in seminar was really good, Professor Winkler was great at helping us learn and the lectures explained parts of the reading I didn't fully understand before. I can't think of anything I would have changed! ",
            "\u00a0There could certainly be a small reduction in the number of authors we read, though all we read this semester were certainly crucial to an understanding of Western philosophy.  Otherwise, the course is fantastic as is and should continue to emphasize student writing and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course is able to burn through a staggering amount of material in a short timeframe while not feeling too rushed (i.e., I was able to retain a very good amount of what we read and discussed). That being said, perhaps the last week, what with trying to fit two existentialists within two classes, was a bit rushed (my suggestion is to reduce that last week to maybe one author). ",
            "\u00a0A lot of dense reading, a lot of focus on a few philosophers and some more interesting and diverse ones crammed in at the end ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Valuable discussions thanks to the leadership of my instructor, informative lectures, rich\r\nconversations with peers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0Its good. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Winkler explained everything really clearly. Especially with philosophy, it is really difficult to discern the argument sometimes. But, Prof. Winkler made sure that we all understood the argument with diagrams on the board and by writing the argument in premise form. I also liked that he catered to everyone's questions even if slightly off topic. He was extremely knowledgable and an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy's greatest strength  its tremendous diversity of ideas  is also something of a weakness. It's easy to default to pessimism when faced with a relentless onslaught of differing opinions, because appreciating foreign ideas takes effort, and the course moves so quickly it can at times be easier to supply refutations than actually try to understand the proposed theory. This applied most especially to the (many) philosophers who were covered in just one week (or less!) Coming to sympathize with, say, Spinoza's worldview, is a tender process. It takes time and energy, and when, after only two seminars, the student's mental investment is discarded for some other philosophical system, a skeptical callous begins to develop. It's the cynicism of one who has loved many and been many times heartbroken. \r\nThe motivated student can overcome this with raw love for philosophy, of course, but there are some more pragmatic ways this skepticism might be combated. The most prominent involves seminar discussions. These can easily become entirely occupied by refutations  \"I don't buy this because of X...\"  leaving the professor battling an onslaught of questions, some of which are not easily answered, but which allow students refuge in cynicism. Questions, of course, are at times necessary; but a good part of them should be directed from the professor to the students, affirming comprehension, challenging one to understand instead of refute.

            "\u00a0Yes, DS provides an amazing foundational understanding of western philosophy. Humanities interested freshman should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Anyone interested in philosophy would be well served by this great intro class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, Prof. Winkler is kind, charitable, and cares for his students.  The course material is difficult, but will engage students so long as they are willing to engage with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they are truly interested in philosophy. If one doesn't have a desire to pursue philosophy currently or in the future, then it will be a very rough semester considering the sheer amount of reading and discussion required. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Philosophy is really important and increasingly relevant when you put it in the context of the modern day (especially the relation of morality and law). Also, Professor Winkler was an amazing professor who made the material clear and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. You'll walk away with far more questions than you entered with. You'll only really have a thirst awakened to learn more about Kant and Murdoch. But you'll leave, amidst all that, with a better understanding of what life is and how we should live it. "
