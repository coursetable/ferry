            "\u00a0I appreciated that the course makes no pretensions and is designed with the reality in mind that its students are non-STEM majors. The grade breakdown is really nice because the exams don't count for too much and there are plenty of psets, so if you don't do too well on any one assignment, you have ample room to make up for it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course gave a glimpse into many areas of astronomy, which is very interesting information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the information is cool, the course is horrible. Lecture is essentially useless in that Professor Kenney speeds through important and difficult concepts but spends plenty of time giving clicker questions about things we haven't yet talked about. He has also spent a good portion of class reading the extended version of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star--not so sure what I was supposed to gain from that. The course is advertised as being suitable for non-STEM majors and has no prerequisites other than a working knowledge of elementary algebra. Neither of these are true. While the content of the course is manageable, it expects a pretty solid foundation in physics in order to understand many of the concepts. If you have not taken many upper-level science courses or if your high school did not have strong science courses, this class will be especially challenging. The QR aspect of this course is the absolute worst part of the class. A working knowledge of elementary algebra will not get you far on the homework. Example problems are never taught in class. Never. Professor Kenney once said \"I'm going to skip this because it's on your homework.\" Huh???? There are tons of new formulas being presented and you are expected to know how to use them (beyond just plugging in numbers) without any instruction from class. There is, however, an ~optional~ discussion section which goes over similar (but not quite similar enough) problems as the homework taught by the TAs. However, there are only two. Do not take this class unless you are considering astro as a major or just really like science courses that aren't taught well! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, explained big concepts in a simple way\r\nWeaknesses: little discussion of the math in class, often difficult to know which formulas to use for which things ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging and well organized. Jeff did a great job of making the lectures accessible and including (sometimes hilarious) examples. Some of the other assignments, particularly the observing session, were quite chaotic and disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAS were fairly good. They explained concepts much better than the professor they worked for.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Jeff Kenney did a terrible job in teaching this course. He had no respect for students' time or academic struggles. He taught the class badly and simply made the course very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are, honestly, few. One strength is the ability to hold students accountable for attending the class using clicker questions to track attendance. Major weaknesses come in the course structure and teaching style. The course is not well designed to facilitate the ability for students to perform well on examinations. Students with strong STEM backgrounds may find it easier to do well on the exams and homework in the course, but in terms of its advertisement as an astronomy course geared towards individuals who do not have strong STEM backgrounds, the course fairs very poorly in its preparation for those students to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it's over and the weaknesses can be summarized as the snide, unfortunate attitude of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0There were too many incremental assignments - lecture quizzes and reading quizzes and weekly psets and observing sessions, with two final exams, is a little way too much. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: wide range of material covered, set up with readings, psets, and lecture encourage student growth\r\nweakness: i think that this class moved a bit too fast ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength and a weakness is the amount of evaluations that the course has. You have a midterm, a final, weekly homework, reading, attendance, and an observing session. It's great that your grade is made up of a variety of components, but also means you have to stay on top of it. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty solid course overall. I think any issues present were remedied by the time the final occurred. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great and informative, but I thought the grading system on the homework was unclear. I appreciated the detailed solutions which were eventually posted, but I didn't understand why and how points were taken off. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is really well designed for non-majors.  There are a lot of points you can get just by showing up and doing the work, which i really appreciate as a stem-illiterate.  Kenney makes it fun. ",
            "\u00a0This class is about a really cool topic. That's its biggest asset. However, this class was exceptionally poorly structured. Lectures themselves were quite goodengaging, well-explained, etcbut the class simply did not teach how to solve any sort of problem on the homework sets. The few worked examples that Professor Kenney showed in class were rushed and poorly explained. To do the homework, you either had to dig through the textbook to find some kind of similar worked example or go to discussion sections. Those discussion sections, however, were also super poorly structured because the entire time was spent essentially just watching the TFs go through examples. Office hours, unlike sections, were helpful in terms of getting specific questions answered, but attending office hours was strangely and somewhat counter-intuitively discouraged at the start of the semester. This class is advertised as requiring only an elementary algebra background, and I understand that we needed to push ourselves to learn on our own, but the course's structure left us mostly on our own about math techniques needed for the problems. Either a) stop discouraging office hour attendance, b) make discussion sections less inflexibly organized so that students can actually ask specific questions, c) teach more of the math concepts (and teach them more slowly/effectively) in lecture, or d) offer more help. There's not much extra tutoring easily available for this course (and if there is, it's difficult to find/seems to be only for those who are doing very poorly in the course). An interesting course, but really needs restructuring. Also, get some female TFs! Seeing a teaching team of a male professor and three male TFs was pretty discouraging, especially in a field that is already so dominated by males. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and the TAs and the professor are very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The reading and lectures seemed to cover the same material, which made keeping up with both a bit tiring at times. ",
            "\u00a0I don't believe the reading quizzes are necessary for a good comprehension of the course (perhaps reading could be optional)! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting and the homework challenging but manageable. Could be improved by scheduling discussion section better. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially those seeking a credit in the sciences because no background is required for the class and the content is also very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who needs a doable QR credit that won't eat up their whole life, or to anyone with a vague interest in astronomy they have yet to explore. It is a fascinating field and this class shows that without being super difficult or requiring all your time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. ",
            "\u00a0Only to one interested in space ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an engaging science credit. It is not a gut- you definitely need to keep up on the weekly work and readings, but Professor Kennedy makes the class great and accessible to a wide range of backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students, since the course was extremely engaging, and required periodic studying rather than last second cramming. The professor was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course should never be taken if Jeff Kenney is the professor. He is by far the worse professor I have had at Yale. I have never been so angered by a professor and a class. Firstly, Kenney did not spend one minute in class working out a math problem although every single homework problem was based on math, not concepts. In fact, Kenney spent one class reading Twinkle Twinkle Little Star for 10 minutes before later refusing to do an actual hw problem because lack of time. There are countless examples of Jeff Kenney not valuing the time of his students--just like he did in that class. The observing session, for example, caused me to call out of work and miss out on 50 dollars. Why did I pick up shifts that day and not plan ahead, you ask? Because it's impossible to do so--Kenney only told us that the event was happening 2 hours before the time of the session because the schedule of a Yalie is definitely that flexible. I am also convinced that a cup of coffee has more empathy if you burn your mouth drinking it than Kenney does if you do poorly on one of his exams. The midterm had a low average but instead of taking a moment to reflect on how his poor teaching may have led to these lackluster results, Jeff Kenney decided to state  the only reason people did not do well was because they did not go to section and sent an email saying \"go to section if you want to save your grades....\" Section was optional, and although this was the only place where problems were worked through, Kenney removed two sections (he removed one in the same email in which he yelled at us for not going) making it very hard to find one that was at a good time to go. Once again, no empathy for his students' academic struggles or time. He also left us out of class like 5 minutes out of class about every single day. On the exam, there was a question in which you had to memorize information that took up half a slide--even though we were not given any warning that we had to know that. Please do yourself a favor, and DO NOT--I  REPEAT DO NOT--take this course if Jeff Kenney is the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to any student who does not have an excellent scientific and mathematical background because they will struggle to find the resources and teaching in the course which will allow them to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I would not if you are looking for a gut science, this is certainly not what you should pick. Not because the material is hard or the workload high, but because the professor does everything he can to make sure that it is as unpleasant as an experience as possible. ",
            "\u00a0maybe ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it! It definitely isn't a simple easy science credit (if that is what you're looking for) but it's definitely a manageable course for non-science majors and you learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Solid Science credit for those in need of one. Material is interesting enough and keeps you engaged through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0yes -- pretty interesting and can be grasped with even the most basic science and math understanding ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you're looking for a doable QR/SC.  Professor Kenney makes it interesting, and there are a lot of points you can pick up just by showing up and doing the work.  The exams are not a huge portion of the grade, which is super helpful if you're allergic to stem like me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but know that it's not a total gut. It will take some time to do the problem sets, especially because the course is very poorly organized to facilitate learning the actual math needed for the homework. The material is interesting and Professor Kenney is a pretty good lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great science / QR credit for non-STEM majors  note, however, that this is NOT a gut. That is, it is a decently easy class if you do the readings and understand the formula; but you can't just skip lectures and expect to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! For people who need a QR credit and have always wanted to take an astro class I would recommend. The professor is very engaging and the lectures are fun. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for the quality of the content of the course, but not for the structure of it. While I thought the material was quite interesting, I was frustrated by the actual course throughout most of the semester. In terms of workload, the class isn't too bad, just weekly problem sets (which don't take too long), a midterm, a final, reading quizzes for each lecture (which were a bit annoying, but not difficult), and a couple random assignments throughout the semester.
