            "\u00a0I learned quite a lot about how to read case law, how to understand the world we live in technologically within the law, and learned how to be a better person and student generally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a TON about different legal cases regarding privacy, technological advancements that have happened in the last few decades, and how laws have scrambled to catch up. ",
            "\u00a0This course will teach you all about navigating the technological world through law, and show how norms can inform how we conceive of our privacy. ",
            "\u00a0Brads class is awesome. The conversations are often free flowing, and you might regret not speaking up sooner to explore certain avenues of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must take. On top of learning all about privacy (and your lack thereof), the readings alongside response paper help to hone your argumentative and analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0Learning with Brad is among my favorite experiences at Yale. The topics we cover in this course are entirely unresolvedthere are no right answers, only avenues for you to explore and question and try to understand the issues we cover better. It's a wonderful opportunity to do independent and creative thinking in an environment that is incredibly fun and engaging. Seminars flew by. The reading responses are no joke, thoughexpect to spend a chunk of hours on them each week. You will take away however much you put in. I loved it. "

            "\u00a0Brad is the best professor/lecturer/whatever Yale has ever had. This man is going to change the world exactly how he wants to -- by his students landing in high places in the legal or technological framework of our country and those people making decisions based on what they learn in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: a lotttt of reading, too much to manage reading everything so I think most people kind of just resorted to skimming or going on Wikipedia for the cases. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly fun seminar, great professor, super interesting readings, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the expectations for assignments and grading were a bit more clear ",
            "\u00a0As it stands, this course is nearly perfected. My one desire would be to have the law school TA's actually show up to class to give greater perspective to our discussions. Also getting reading responses back in a more timely manner (again TA's were responsible for that) would be great to get feedback on our ideas. ",

            "\u00a0If you took CPSC 183 and you already know you love Brad, take 185. It's 183 on steroids. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a fun and interesting course. The conversation flows freely, and you get to know your peers and the professor well. Brad really cares about his students and truly believes in their abilities to change the world - and FREE CUPCAKES AND DINNER. That being said, Brad has a rather unorthodox teaching style, you either like it or you don't. If you're not an outgoing personality, I would really advise against taking this seminar unless you're looking for an opportunity to push yourself outside of your comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0YES! The conversation and debate in class is extremely interesting, Brad really makes you think. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend the class. It's a must-take before you graduate. The material is deeply interesting, the readings are engaging and very well-curated. The debates in class are always compelling and passionate. It's exactly what a Yale class ought to be. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended. Brad is amazing. The material is interesting. You will not be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're looking for a fun seminar! DEFINITELY take this course if you're thinking of going to law school. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in the intersection between law and technology this is definitely a class to make room for in your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at Yale. Even if you're not going into CS, this course has a broad reaching applicability. On top of the class being taught by the one and only Brad Rosen, the material is essential to understanding the importance and roll of privacy in the digital age. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. If you took 183 and dug the materials covered, this is your chance to learn it all in more depth, paying closer attention to issues that affect our everyday lives and are so, so freaky. Learning with Brad is among my favorite experiences at Yale. The topics we cover in this course are entirely unresolvedthere are no right answers, only avenues for you to explore and question and try to understand the issues we cover better.

The reading responses are no joke, thoughexpect to spend a chunk of hours on them each week. You will take away however much you put in. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0This is CS183 but more in-depth on technology as it relates to privacy. You already know if you'll like Brad's style or not; this class is more of that but in a smaller class setting with a more discussion-y style. The syllabi from past years are up on Brad's site and are consistent; poke through those. There is very little guidance in terms of work due for the class, but it's basically the same as 183: a weekly reading response (it will take however long it takes you to focus on the readings and come up with something to say) and a final project (it's assumed during the semester that you know that this final project will be a thing, and there's no guidance whatsoever as long as you put in some time and effort). Despite being a seminar, it is possible for quieter people with decent homework to do well. What Brad cares about is that you are trying to engage with the material. "
