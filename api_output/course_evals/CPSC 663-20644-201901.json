It is not used very much in deep learning research, because it is fairly low-level, but it provides an excellent foundation in thinking about how deep learning models are graphical. \r\n\r\nThe other skillset you will learn is the theory behind neural networks. Smita covers a range of deep learning technologies, and you will not become an expert in any one of them, but you will have a good idea of how they work at a high-level. This is really useful as the field evolves very quickly. Many people working in the field are software engineers who don't know a lot of the math and theory behind how deep learning works. In this course you will get a foundation in deep learning that will be enormously useful as the field develops and provide a critical advantage in your career. For instance, I was able to read and understand most of deep learning papers after taking this course. ",

Also, the professor was not always very engaged with the class ",
            "\u00a0The course was not very well-structured and the problem sets were not well aligned with the material being covered in class. Being more deliberate with the topics that are covered and selecting problem set questions to match would improve the class, in my opinion. ",

I took this course because although I had previous classes that touched on machine learning, I wanted a more comprehensive understanding of the field, and I definitely gained that. The course could be improved by being more timely about giving student feedback, since it took a while for us to get grades on the problem sets back, which made it difficult to gauge how you were doing.

In particular, there is no ULA for this class. Problems sets are graded many months after they were turned in so you have little idea of how youre doing in the course. ",

I do wish we would have had a few more homeworks, and maybe used TF Keras some, because that is pretty common in industry. ",

            "\u00a0This is a good introduction to the subject of neural networks, for it brushes on many different types of network architechtures for different problems, and many design principles for neural networks. However, I think it would be perhaps more desirable to focus more on a few types of network and maybe break this into 2 courses.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think some more class time (maybe regular office hours at a set time and date during the week) could have been devoted to walking through some tutorials in tensorflow. I was able to learn a basic usage of Tensorflow by practicing with the homework assignments, but I do not feel profficient enough to code from scratch in the end of this course, without using some of the codes presented in the class as a template. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed very strong at introducing many key topics in the artificial intelligence field. I think it stayed up to date with the cutting edge technology here as well as provided a good understanding of when to use one neural network architecture vs another.\r\nOne major weakness was the assignments. They lacked a consistent thread and made executing an assignment more difficult. While the content of the assignments were not easy or too challenging, the manor in which they were presented to the students was very convoluted at times.\r\nFor instance, an incomplete piece of code was given to us and we were told to complete it with some objectives in mind. This piece of code would be deprecated, out of date, and ultimately difficult to read. I think a better assignment would be to ask the students to do a task, defining objectives along the way, rather than providing them an out of date cryptic piece of code. "
