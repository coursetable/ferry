            "\u00a0Yes! Ancient Greek is exceedingly challenging and unintuitive but very very rewarding, especially for students who are interested in literary or historical texts from Classical Antiquity - you get to read everything in their original scripts! How exciting! ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this course so long as they feel comfortable dedicating a large portion of time into studying and reviewing material, especially if they are interested in the classics or understanding ancient philosophy/lit/history etc. ",
            "\u00a0yes if they want to learn greek ",
            "\u00a0If Joe Morgan is teaching Greek, I definitely recommend this course! His knowledge of Ancient Greek language and culture is both deep and broad, and he's genuinely eager to share that knowledge. In a university full of jaded students, that's a trait to be recognized and prized.\r\n\r\nBe warned, though: Ancient Greek is hard. Harder than Latin, or any modern language; every sentence is an intricate puzzle to be teased apart. (Classical languages in general tend to have that trait.) So only take it if you think that's what you want, rather than a modern language where the rules are relatively simple and you can actually apply your knowledge in a foreign country. "
