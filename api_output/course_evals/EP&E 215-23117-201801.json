            "\u00a0I learned how to approach philosophy in a less formal way. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a survey of western philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a solid introduction to political economy, as well as the histories of intellectual thought in ethics and politics. The class brilliantly demonstrated how the ancient Greek notion of oikonomia transformed into modern economics. ",
            "\u00a0Close-reading and thinking. Sometimes courses feel like just like series of homework that need to be submitted, but in this class I felt I could spend my time actually reading and thinking about the texts. ",
            "\u00a0A general overview of the development of philosophical thought surrounding ethics, politics, and economics from Plato to the beginning of the twentieth century (and how those three concepts have overlapped and shifted over that time). ",
            "\u00a0This class took us through the history of economic thought, tracing out its early start in what was essentially political philosophy, and then following thinkers like Rousseau, Hobbes, Marx, through to Smith, Edgeworth, and Pareto, as economics slowly separated from politics. It gave me a solid understanding of some of the various ways classical thinkers have thought about the organization of society and the economy, and also helped me think about how to structure an in-depth paper on multiple philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0My critical thinking skills improved, and I'm proud of the improvements I've seen in my writing (thanks to Professor Cammack!). I learned about many of the essential texts that have framed historical and modern discussion on ethics, politics, and economics in Western society. I've also refined my understanding of ethics, politics, and economics (I appreciated how we started the class by offering definitions of the words and then revisited our definitions at the end of the class). I learned to recognize the grey areas in issues/themes that are generally painted as black or white. "

            "\u00a0The course had interesting readings, although sometimes on the longer side. The class discussions were always interesting and the forum posts help to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were perfectly chosen and class discussions were always engaging. The format for online forum responses changed in a positive way near the end of the course. This class especially excels at surveying the key arguments in the historical development of ethics, politics, and economics, and naturally shows how all three topics interact (or why they do not interact). Maybe saving 10 minutes at the end of each seminar discussion to evaluate the ideas explicated would be good (although we did do this several times across the semester). ",
            "\u00a0The instructor's leadership and the structure of the course were its greatest strengths! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class; I thought the readings every week progressed in a really interesting way, and I genuinely feel like I learned to think very differently about ethics, politics, and economics. I will say that sometimes class discussions weren't always the most engaging--the conversation tended to veer off and be dominated by a couple people (but that's a problem inherent to most seminars, not just this class). I thing maybe when that started to happen a little more redirection would've been good, but other than that I thought it was a good class (if a little long--2 hours is a long time to be sitting in one spot). ",
            "\u00a0At times this course can feel like its not teaching you much, and youre just floundering around listening to your classmates talk about what some dude whose book none of you read anyway had to say about a topic we understand much better now than they did in his time. But towards the end of class t actually started to be quite coherent and everything really came together in a cool way. The best authors also came at the end as well, but Prof Cammack just did a great job in the last few classes tying everything together and making it feel very worthwhile. Professor Cammack, if you take it with her, is also absurdly helpful, friendly, and approachable, and invested in her students in a way neither I nor any of my friends in the class had ever seen before. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the materials that Professor Cammack has us read, and our class discussions were particularly engaging. I left the class with a solid understanding of the arguments made by the theorists we read, but also with an understanding that I've got much more learning to do. The class was structured well. I thought the Canvas posts and papers were wonderful opportunities for us to dig deeper and properly wrestle with the material. Also feedback I received on my writing was AMAZING. I rarely get detailed feedback like the feedback I received from Professor Cammack, and her critiques have been very helpful.  I especially enjoyed our discussions on economic theory (the intersections of ethics and economics). I would say that I enjoyed our last class the most because we had an opportunity to reflect aloud about the course material and draw connections between our readings/class discussions and modern society. I wish these reflective moments were built into the course, kind of like pit stops. Moreover, I think the course material would be definitely improved by adding greater diversity to the material (works by women and people of color, for example). "

            "\u00a0This was a great class with really interesting teachings, and Professor Cammack is both wonderful human being and professor. Obviously all EP&E majors have to take it, but I would definitely recommend non-EP&E people also consider taking it because it's a really enjoyable couse ",
            "\u00a0Daniela is a terrific communicator and helps you chat about philosophy in a comfortable way. I would recommend taking the course with her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Id recommended this course to anyone interested in gaining a deeper knowledge of philosophy, from Plato and Aristotle, to Rousseau, Adam Smith, and Marx. ",
            "\u00a0I would completely recommend this course to another student. It was one of my favorite -- and definitely among the most important -- courses at Yale so far that I've encountered. I think the readings and guidance (by Professor Cammack) should be a prerequisite to any economics classes. The class makes lucid what so many other classes only touch or gesture to -- how exactly did economics form? And what challenges does it pose to ethics and politics? A wonderful class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a thorough and engaging survey of Western civilization's foundational political philosophies ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course! Professor Cammack is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Most of us associate all of these texts and authors with just one famous line or thought, but after this class, we have a good understanding about the intellectual development of Western EP&E. ",
            "\u00a0Probably would not take this course unless your major requires it. If you must take it though, definitely take it with Professor Cammack. She's wonderful and her passion for the material really breathes life into the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; there's a LOT of material (the class is basically trying to condense a thousand years of philosophical thought into a semester), but for me at least I was impressed by how extensively we were able to cover it. Seminar does tend to drag in the last twenty minutes (but that happens with any really long seminar) but the professor is really nice and engaging, and you definitely come away with a very different perspective on how ethics, politics, and economics interrelate. ",
            "\u00a0I have mixed feelings. On the one hand its kind of anther BS seminar, but on the other it was actually cool at times to think about some of the stuff the authors were thinking about. I mean if youre EPE definitely worth it to try out the major a bit, and also highly recommend taking it with Camamack. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would.  I was really nervous about majoring in EPE, but this class calmed by fears. I really enjoyed contemplating the questions we discussed, especially when I was asked to revisit/challenge my preconceptions about the material. I think any student would benefit from taking this class. The workload is manageable (and much more enjoyable) if completed gradually. Take it! "
