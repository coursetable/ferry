            "\u00a0I learned a lot of meta-stuff about the workings of analytic tools that scholars use. I.e., what is the use of a category? Of a comparison? I thought a lot about the stakes of how we think. ",
            "\u00a0This course expanded my conception of what religion means. We were able to talk about all sorts of structures, frameworks, stories, and paradigms that individuals construct to make a society, which I now realize is an extremely fascinating process. I learned too what a thoughtful, engaged, and well-directed class discussion looks like. It was easily the best seminar atmosphere I've experienced at Yale so far. Most of all, though, I think my writing improved greatly. I'd never had these kinds of assignments before that made me condense my thoughts, proofs, and ideas into a short page. I gained sharpness, clarity, and organization for my writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great methods course in how to conduct humanities work. In terms of finding, analyzing, and making arguments using sources, this class was really helpful. It also was a great way to understand the breadth of religious studies as a field. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most insightful classes I've taken at Yale: it was a crash course on how to READ - not only academic papers, but artifacts throughout life. Expectations were always clear, both the professors' passion for teaching was incredibly apparent. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skills to more critically analyze the world around me, both of things directly relating to religion and those that do not. I honed my ability to read deeply and thoughtfully, questioning the framings of documents and questioning how they speak to other texts. This is a class that teaches you how to think well. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how to think more critically about thr texts studied Religious Studies and learned a tremendous amount about how to write well and concisely. Furthermore, I learned how to better articulate arguments. ",
            "\u00a0In Religion and Society, I learned how to level religions--that is to say, I learned how to interpret traditionally religious communities alongside those that are not often understood as such. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at the world differently-- to understand what deeper questions seemingly superficial cultural artifiacts were attempting to answer. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a completely different framework within which to think about academia and scholarship as a practice. I found myself applying many of the methods we used in class to discuss our readings and cultural phenomena to my work in other classes. It also made me think much more carefully about the importance of language in scholarship. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course is one big strength! The class discussions felt productive, respectful, and engaging, and the assignments asked for clean, pointed writing. The readings were fascinating, too. I'm grateful I was able to take this class during my time here.\r\n\r\nI think something to be improved would be the final exam. I thought 5 essays was an unnecessary volume of writing for a 3 hr test. I would have much preferred to spend more time on 3 or 4 essays and really show my best work. As a slow writer, I felt like I wasn't able to accurately show what I gained from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was really flexible to individual interests, especially with respect to the individual assignments. It was very good at preparing me for my individual scholarly interests in the humanities. The expectations for assignments could have been clearer, but I form used to the ambiguity and expectations as the term progressed. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible preparation. No weaknesses. Strengths: wide variety of articles, deals with questions that span relevant issues, very thorough grading feedback ",
            "\u00a0I think that students would emerge from Yale better prepared for whatever comes next if many other classes had a similar rigor and format. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are uncountable. The professor is the most thoughtful, aware, brilliant, and passionate educator at Yale. The material covered was diverse and interesting. The course pushes students' perspectives--blows them--about how religious studies can be used as a framework. ",
            "\u00a0The shining strength of the course was organization and teaching. It was evident that Prof. Lofton and Lucia care deeply about their students; this was shown through their hospitality in the classroom itself and in the meeting spaces in which they hosted us otherwise. This indeed inclined my ears further toward their teaching: lessons were well-prepared, voices so amazingly articulate, and resources well used (eg.: the chalkboard, the projector). ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly well designed-- the readings for each week were interesting and interlocked in fascinating ways. The assignments were sometimes unclear or underdeveloped, however. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated our class discussions and when Katie and Lucia brought outside material (websites, videos, etc.) into class to apply our readings to. I do wish the class wasn't at 9:25I felt that the quality of discussion would have been improved if people were more awake. Also, while the feedback on assignments was very thorough in one sense, I would have appreciated having a more clear understanding of how the grading scale related to the assignment's requirements, both at the outset of the course and for individual assignments. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! I learned so much, not just about religion and society, but about constructions of thought, writing, and scholarly discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for anyone who wants to improve the skills involved in humanities research. Even if religion itself is not your favorite subject of study, you will be surprised at the breadth of the field. Assignments can be about almost anything you want, as long as you are working on the appropriate skills. Sometimes the expectations for assignments werent always clear, but Katie and Lucia gave very helpful feedback so at least after the fact you have a clear understanding of the expectations to better understand future assignments. For those with a particular interest in religion as it is typically defined, this class certainly has a lot of space for your interests, but will be about so much more. ",
            "\u00a0BEST COURSE AT YALE! ",
            "\u00a0I would enthusiastically recommend this course to anyone. It will challenge you, make you feel stupid, and then build you into a better writer and thinker. Leave your ego at the door and come prepared to really engage with ideas and other people. ",
            "\u00a0YES! It's challenging and incredible. ",
            "\u00a0My recommendation of this course depends on two factors that are unrelated to the isolated goodness of the course itself. I would consider first the student's religious inclinations, and second the student's academic pace. This course is a good opportunity to understand the presuppositions of religion within non-academic religious institutions (so I would recommend to Divinity School students). This course is also very fast paced, so I would definitely think about whether the student considering it would benefit in some way from this type of environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Particularly if you are considering going into academia in the humanities (anything from religious studies to history or political science), this course will provide you with a framework for engaging with and critiquing other scholarship. Beyond that, it will also make you think much more deeply about the communities that you are a part of and the way that you engage with the world. I might especially recommend this class for non-RLST majors (like me!). "
