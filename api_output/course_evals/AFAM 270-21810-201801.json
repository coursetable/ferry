            "\u00a0I grew as an analyst of social policy in this class, and about the balance of power that varies along economic lines. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about poverty in the US from the readings and class discussion. Prof. Horans class also pushed me to articulate my ideas more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good amount about the manifestations of American poverty and reduction methods ",
            "\u00a0How to better understand poverty in relation to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to read and analyze urban policy with a critical eye. I also developed a much stronger grasp of what poverty is, why it exists, and how policymakers and activists can work to solve it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different causes of poverty, the various ways policymakers and activists have attempted to combat poverty, and the struggles involved in assessing anti-poverty policy. ",
            "\u00a0As someone without a strong academic policy background (but plenty of experience with policy in practice), this was a great course for getting more familiar with academic evaluations of policies or other social-science work on poverty and U.S. cities. I particularly appreciated the variety of perspectives in the literature, some very quantitative, and others ethnographic and/or more qualitative. It was also interesting and refreshing to discuss the gaps between academic work on policy, policymaking and implementation, and people's experiences of policy. ",
            "\u00a0I got a glimpse of how people experience poverty in their day-to-day lives and the issues that preoccupy them most (and how those issues, at times, differ from the problems that policymakers focus on). I learned how poverty and deprivation are defined in many different ways, and how the definitions and metrics of poverty we ultimately choose affect the policies and programs we design. I learned several different theories of why people become poor and why many of them remain poor. I learned how actors at every level of government have tried to mitigate poverty and how difficult it is to evaluate antipoverty policy in context and find conclusive evidence. I gained an appreciation for the complex decisions facing communities, nonprofits, and well-intended government agencies trying to address poverty. Above all else, Ive learned how to study poverty and poor people with humility, and Ive resolved to fight against my tendency to trust the policy experts on whats best for poor people, and instead devote more of my time and energy to listening to and learning from poor people themselves. ",
            "\u00a0It showed me how much poverty policy intersects with other realms that Im interested in like education policy. Also, I learned how to write critical reading responses that moved beyond my opinion of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much better understanding of the causes of urban poverty and of the public debate surrounding these issues. I also learned more about the ways researchers have tried to better understand these issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about poverty, policy, and became a much better writer. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus was well-developed to encourage deep and critical thought about the themes of power and economic disenfranchisement in American cities. Discussion sometimes felt performative and surface-level, which may have come from the clear boundaries for acceptable political positions, which stopped us from effectively examining and understanding why the positions within those boundaries were the best ones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class engagements\r\nAreas for improvements: include more ethnogrpahies throughout the year as policy papers can be a bit dry. Also have papers be more free in terms of not following strict prompt. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Variety of readings. Very good selection of weaknesses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes did not get to some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths - The readings were incredible, and writing reading responses every week forced us to really engage with them. The midterm and final papers are hard, but also encourage deep understanding of the readings and drawing connections across them.  Professor Horan is incredible, and truly cares about each and every one of her students. The group of students is great - it is cool to take a class with people who really care about these issues, and have diverse involvement with them.\r\nThe weaknesses - Sometimes seminar discussions got a bit off track. It's great that people have different experiences, but too much sharing of personal anecdotes can get tiresome. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course. I cannot think of any concrete changes that need to occur. The class offered a well-balanced mix of ethnographic readings and policy papers. Class discussion was engaging and thought provoking, and Professor Horan did a fantastic job of telling students which readings to prioritize. The paper prompts were clear, and Professor Horan made herself available to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course could have benefited from more historical perspectives on U.S. politics, especially as we sometimes read about policies that have been in place (or had changed, been invented, etc.) at pivotal moments of U.S. history, such as the New Deal, the growth of the New Right (and Left), etc. Overall, though, I don't think we lost a lot because of that. Professor Horan carefully chooses seminar participants based on academic and extracurricular (including work) interests and experiences, and because of that our class always had robust discussions from a variety of perspectives. I also appreciated how Professor Horan kept conversations grounded in reality--she made it clear from week one, for example, that we wouldn't be proposing the overthrow of capitalism as a solution to some of the problems we'd encounter. Professor Horan was a great seminar leader and provided feedback on each of our weekly reading comments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The reading list is phenomenal from start to finish, and Professor Horan has so much knowledge, wisdom, and conviction to share with the class. // Weaknesses: Class discussion varied widely in quality from week to week, but so do most Yale seminars. Prof. Horan is probably one of the best seminar facilitators Ive ever witnessed, though. She actually responds to students comments in class and somehow manages to tie together disparate bits and pieces from the discussion into a neat, coherent summary of the most relevant ideas. Cant think of any improvements. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength for me was that you didnt have to do every reading response because some weeks I truly didnt have the time to do them. I also really enjoyed small group discussions in the beginning of the semester and wish that wouldve continued to happen throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed our class discussions and the fact that we tied our course material to current events at the beginning of every class. ",
            "\u00a0Cynthia gives really clear feedback and responds to emails very regularly. She holds people to a high standard and her grading is tough. I finally was able to pinpoint issues in my writing that I had been puzzling over. However, Professor Horan is also really busy and has a lot of thesis students, just because she is such a good professor. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class only to students very interested in policy and urban spaces with fairly left personal politics: it was not the easiest classroom to have meaningful discussion in, so while the content was strong, it is only really accessible for particularly driven students. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately prof. Horan isnt teaching this class again, but if she were then definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great course, even for students with limited understanding of politics ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! It is a lot of work, but it's 100% worth it, and if you still want to solve poverty afterwards, you'll come out with a much deeper understanding of how to do so and why poverty exists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to a student interested in social policy. The class really allows students to dive into key pieces of legislation that few people are familiar with. Discussions are fantastic given that students openly disagreed with one another but debated in an organized manner. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to another student that's serious about thinking about urban poverty and how to address it. I had a great time with the course because I've seen many of the mechanisms we talked about in practice, both from my own life but also through work experiences. This course is really for anyone, and I think it benefits from a wide variety of academic backgrounds, but it probably works best when students have experience with poverty themselves or working to address poverty through other work or volunteer experiences. That said, do the readings. Professor Horan is no-nonsense, but she's also a lot of fun and leads a great seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone remotely interested in urban studies and urban poverty should take a course with Professor Horan, who will expand the breadth and depth of your thinking about these topics. She has curated a wonderfully engaging reading list that touches on so many aspects of poverty politics, from pure human experience to the very technical, yet is also very coherent. The course has a clear narrative arc that by the end of the semester leaves you satisfied with what youve learned but also fully aware that youve just barely scratched the surface and have so much more to learn about the world and about people. The weekly reading responses hold you accountable to doing the readings thoroughly and thinking about them both critically AND constructively. Although students have the option of writing their own research paper, most of us wrote Prof. Horans own midterm and final paper prompts. They were the most challenging papers Ive ever written but also the most rewarding to plan and write. Prof. Horan is a harsh but fair grader. If she teaches this course again some time, I urge you to make time for it and to not care about grades for once. You will learn so, so much from the readings and from her, and walk away a more informed, thoughtful, and deliberate person because of it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend it to anyone. I think especially those interested in political science, but theres a lot to learn about the poor from this class in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at all interested in poverty or urban politics in general. I felt as though this class engaged with current issues and policy in more in-depth way than most classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor has very high standards for writing and can have an abrupt response to student comments in the classroom. I feel that the information is fundamentally important to understanding the nature of urban poverty in the United States. The introductions and overview by the professor that put the articles in context are clear and arguably more helpful than the classroom discussions themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if she decides to teach it again. You learn so much about the subject (though most of the readings are on policy) and you also improve so much as a writer. "
