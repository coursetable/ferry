            "\u00a0How to better differentiate between topics and puzzles and publishable research questions. ",
            "\u00a0Great way to explore how to undertake a stand alone research project. It also provided a great opportunity to learn how to present findings in front of an audience and receive critical feedback on our ideas. The professors also provided great feedback on my project. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a really helpful overview of the publication processhow and when you submit to journals, what kind of feedback you should anticipate, what makes a strong draft for submission.  This course also allowed me to engage in the process of giving and receiving feedback amongst peers and advisors.  Doing so helped me feel more comfortable and prepared for the professional environment of political science departments. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a potentially publishable paper. ",
            "\u00a0Greg and Ian were great instructors.  They informed us of what made a good paper, gave us specific examples, and led useful class discussions.  They also gave us realistic expectations about the publication process.  I learned a great deal about the highs and lows of writing a complete academic paper. ",
            "\u00a0how to formulate a research question, go about answering it + effectively presenting results to an academic audience ",

            "\u00a0This iteration of the course seemed to be the most optimal in terms of meeting objectives. One suggestion would be to have had a small-group meeting midway through the second term just to touch base with other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nIt was really well organized, probably reflecting the fact that both professors taught the course multiple times previously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nWish we could have had one class session in the spring where we convened as a group to do a check in on what others were up to and any difficulties/opportunities that people were encountering in their research. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the course would have benefited from meeting as a class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly, I think the course was designed well. The only thing that maybe could be added is organized, small discussion groups by themes in the second semester so students can ask for feedback on research challenges they're running into. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors were great.  My only recommendation is that a full class meeting in early January where each student had to discuss their progress could have been useful to force me to do more work during Fall semester. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: in the first semester, we spent a lot of time together working on our ideas + providing feedback to others. I wish we had had the same opportunity in the second semester; I think we could have all benefitted from a second feedback round from our class mates or working in groups to talk about challenges we have faced etc. to make this a larger learning experience for everyone.
