However, her class was sooooooooo awesome and so applicable to Public Health. I loved it so much. I wish she had more classes and I wish I could have taken this earlier.\r\n\r\nI will say though that many students who wanted to take the class could not beacuase Biostats 2 is offered at the same time and EHS students are required to take the class. Just a heads up if you wanted higher enrollment. ",
