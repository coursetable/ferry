            "\u00a0Learned about a new area of history Id never explored before. Very interesting. Also unique focus on primary sources which lots of other classes dont have. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a complete and interesting overview of the structure of Jewish life from the 7th to 16th centuries. ",
            "\u00a0A broad history from the 6th century to the 17th century ",
            "\u00a0I had a limited knowledge of Judaism and Islam prior to taking this course, and knew nothing about the interaction of the two religions specifically in medieval times. I developed a base of this knowledge which I found to be not only fascinating, but also informative for my life in general. ",
            "\u00a0We studied the history of the Jews in relation to the Muslim world from the time of Mohammed to Suleiman the Magnificent (7th to the 16th century). We examined both general historical trends and the realities of daily life as shown through primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about specific period in Jewish history and how scholars approach Jewish history more generally. I also gained a better understanding of how to analyze primary source documents. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the development of Judaism from biblical times into the Middle Ages. The ability to analyse primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about early Jewish history in the context of Muslim lands, which was something that I knew very little about even as someone who went to Jewish day school growing up. It was interesting to examine both particular historical figures (Maimonides, Saadia Gaon, Shabbetai Zvi) as well as trends in culture and demographics over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to closely analyze primary sources and how to piece sometimes contradictory primary texts together. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much I didnt know before about Jewish as well as Muslim history \r\nI really loved this course and it taught me to think critically about primary sources ",
            "\u00a0I took this class because I was interested in taking some Religious Studies courses at Yale and as a follow up to Jewish History and Thought in Ancient to Premodern times. I walked away from these classes which a much better understanding for the foundations that Judaism was built upon and how certain developments and evolutions in the Judaic faith came about. \r\nIf you take this course as after taking Marcus' Jewish History class then you will feel like the first few lectures discuss familiar topics from the end of the previous semester, but then will expand upon them. \r\nThe 10 page paper is an interesting assignment because you are forced to use only primary sources and then your own interpretations, which is different from all the other courses I have taken at Yale. Definitely enjoyable. "

            "\u00a0Marcus is a very nice professor who is always happy to meet with students and give feedback. Course was very smooth and cant highlight any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Marcus lecture style is very engaging. He brings the communities and historical figures that we study to life by bringing interesting primary source material to class and through his colorful lecture style. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a very good balance of overviewing broad themes and integrating specific details and examples. The lectures are very interesting and the course load is extremely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor does not rely on teaching in the class which makes engagement challenging at times. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the format of the course and Professor Marcus' enthusiasm for the course. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible course. Professor Marcus is wonderful. Nothing to be improved it was so good. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very accessible even to students with little/no prior knowledge and did not feel very daunting. The lectures were interesting and we were not assessed on any material we hadn't covered in class. It was maybe a little dry at times, but a great change of pace from other history lectures where it sometimes feels hard to keep track of what we learn week to week. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! Super interesting, well organized. The readings matched the lectures well. ",
            "\u00a0I can only think of strengths of this course. The professor was highly engaged and prepared and taught us about history but also used evidence from primary sources. Each of his lectures were interesting and I genuinely enjoyed working on our assignments ",
            "\u00a0Digitalizing lecture notes, or at least just major themes, would make the class easier to review for. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if youre not super interest in this area of history (I sure wasnt before this class), Marcus is a great professor and his lectures are very engaging. Reading amount is not absurd as you can often just skim the primary sources since he talks about them in lots of detail in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn a lot without necessarily even realizing it. The material is very interesting and Ivan Marcus is a great lecturer. He is also very nice and helpful-- and a great sense of humor. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about Jewish and Islamic history from one of Yale's finest Professors take it. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS. IT IS A MUST-TAKE. ",
            "\u00a0Yes the material is very elavent to understand Jews in the Middle East throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to another student. I had to take it to fulfill History major requirements, but I enjoyed it immensely in the end. I would recommend to those in the History major, but also those who are not in the History major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, particularly to those who are interested in Jewish or Islamic history. It's an incredibly dynamic period in Jewish history and one that is often generalised and misunderstood, and I thought Professor Marcus did a great job at helping us to see the contrasts and nuance which characterised the relationship between Jews and the Muslim regimes under which they lived during this time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in history during this time period or anyone who wants to learn more about Jewish history in general. The material is made accessible for everyone regardless of if you have taken a history course before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Professor Marcus is truly outstanding, and manages to draw out the main themes of over 600 years of history in a clear and concise way. Take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students regardless of their interest in religion or their academic major. You don't need to know much going in, and the historical view of Jewish communities in Muslim lands over time has appeal for history majors or for students looking to meet distributional requirements and learn something totally new. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Marcus is very engaging and the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would if they are interested at all in the subject matter because it is a clear comprehensive course that gave me great insights into history I had very little knowledge about before "
