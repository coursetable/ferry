            "\u00a0This course was very well designed, with information presented with just enough redundancy to stick but not so much as to waste time, and with assignments selected to cover a broad range of potential subject matter students might need to read without becoming arcane to those outside the selected fields. The professor and TA provided clear and constructive feedback on translations. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Spanish over the summer, but who can't commit or find funding for an in-person class; the online format of the course is a huge asset for anyone who can't be based in New Haven ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was a great way to solidify my knowledge of Spanish going into my qualifying exams. "
