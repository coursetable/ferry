            "\u00a0Learned so much incredibly more about what it means to write clearly. Literally, this class could be called \"Avoiding Ambiguity,\" as that is the major skill you learn through this class. It's really primarily a writing class, just under the topic of the law. ",
            "\u00a0Ehrgood taught me a whole new way of writing. Straightforward, argumentative, concise. It taught me to stop writing like I think I am smart and focus on the substance. ",
            "\u00a0I came away with the course with a set of good questions to ask about the law, such as: On what criteria should a judge decide a case? What is the purpose of punishment? What matters (and what should matter) in the eyes of the law? What's the relationship between the legislature and the judicial branch? \r\n\r\nI also became a lot better at writing, particularly in style and grammar. I find myself editing other people's writing (articles, blogs, recipes, the back of a cereal box, you name it) since taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0How to write clearly. Tons of great writing principles. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Professor Ehrgood is amazing. Ive learned how to become a better writer, thinker, and reader. It is the perfect class to take if you are interested in law school. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Ehrgood is a god - he meets with you at least five times out of class just to offer advice; every class period is amazing -- you are naturally engaged at every moment; no matter how good you think your writing is, this class will teach you how to improve\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload is pretty hefty (though it's front heavy, and the end of the semester is pretty chill) ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. surveys a limited amount of work but delves deeply into each work surveyed, which really squeezes the juice out of everything we learn ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I have taken in my time at Yale. I have learned much more than I expected and will definitely be taking all that I've learned wherever I go. ",
            "\u00a0A definite strength of the course is how many different moving parts there are. I demarcated the three main ones as Style, Legal Analysis, and Spelunking (you'll see what I mean if you take the course). Because we usually spent a bit of time on all three during any given period, I would leave class wondering how 75 minutes just passed. It went by so, so quickly, and each minute was used either effectively or amusingly. ",
            "\u00a0Focusing on craft is very helpful. Spelunkers gets a little old. ",
            "\u00a0The only downside of this course is the heavy workload. Dont take this class if you arent willing to put in the work. But if you are willing, the work definitely pays off in the end. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0YES YES YES! Ehrgood is a fantastic professor! Do not pass by the chance to take a class with him. But make sure this class fits in with your workload. Expect up to 4 hours of work per class period, especially in the first 2/3ds of the semester. Set yourself up to have time to enjoy this class, or else, it will be too much to be enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Its so amazing, Take it. especially if you are considering law school. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. I feel that I have a much better framework for thinking about big questions, a larger toolbox for writing, and more than anything, I feel like I've gained an excellent model for what it looks like when a professor invests deeply in his teaching. You won't find many professors as dedicated to their pedagogy as Ehrgood, and his view of writing and thinking is so inspiringly expansive. He's also been good about adjusting the workload so that the course is more front-loaded than backloaded, and I very much enjoyed the daily assignments. It's good, bite-sized work in comparison to long readings and essays in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Prof. Ehrgood is very helpful and always willing to meet. The essays are fun. I took this class purely to work on my writing, and I think my writing improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course is like a delicious, hot molten lava cake. It will ooze so much knowledge and amazingness that you will beg for more. Please take it please ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone interested in law school should definitely take this course. "
