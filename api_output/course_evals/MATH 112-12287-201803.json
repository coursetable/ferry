            "\u00a0It's taught almost entirely by grad students. While my instructor was good, your mileage may vary. The WebAssigns were a bit tedious and a lot less helpful than the weekly problem set. ",
            "\u00a0The method of teaching in this class does not make sense. They do not teach you how to actually apply what you've learned or even how to do it, but rather just lecture about the theorems and proofs that prove the mathematic concepts we learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job of covering every concept involved in basic calculus, but at times was not particularly engaging. \r\n\r\nThe worksheets were a great way of bridging the gap between what was explained in class and the problem sets, which could be difficult to understand and complete without attending the peer tutoring session. ",
            "\u00a0Section times and the lack of a sizable classroom for peer tutoring sessions were weaknesses. The problem sets were also unnecessarily difficult. ",
            "\u00a0A big weakness to the course was Webassign. It is useless and doesn't add anything that the psets and worksheets didn't, but cost me $100 because I already had the textbook. It was also a little disorganized and it was difficult to know what sections/topics I was expected to learn. ",

Completing math on a computer screen is much harder than completing math on paper (in my opinion). ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that there were many outside resources available, including the peer tutors, practice exams, practice tests on the web assign site, textbook help, etc. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were in how math course are \"flipped\" at Yale, where the professors expect students to understand the material before class, and they use the class time to practice, not teach. I think that the class time should be used to teach, and there should be more visuals to help teach. "

            "\u00a0Yes. If you're in between taking 112 and 115, such as I was, just bite the bullet and take 115. You won't get an \"easy\" A in this class. Even if you have an understanding of calculus coming in, some of the problems can be tricky. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to those interested in building up their knowledge of math. I learned a lot in the class, even if at times it wasn't as engaging as I would have preferred. I think there is a lot to gain from learning the calculus taught in Math 112, even if someone isn't planning on continuing on to higher level math courses. ",
            "\u00a0I  would recommend this course to students who feel they are not  quite ready for Math 115. The course was fairly easy if you have taken Calculus previously and can serve as a refresher for those who may have forgotten concepts. ",
