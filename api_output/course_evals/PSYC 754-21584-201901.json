            "\u00a0This class offers excellent preparation to people who are interested in engaging on a high level with current research in developmental neuroscience. It has helped me to make connections between my own work and study and major questions that clinical psychologists and neuroscientists are asking today. I feel much more confident now that, if I sit down to read a new paper in clinical psychology, I will be able to situate the findings meaningfully in the broader conversations in the field. Additionally, the course has given me a new and highly applicable vocabulary for the neurobiology of stress responses and common mental health disorders. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Gee is an excellent conversation facilitator, and additionally, invited guest speakers many weeks of the term, like Dr. Laurel Joy Gabard-Durnam and Dr. Rosemarie Perry, to share on their current works in the field. Students complete this course with the sense that they have participated in important dialogues (including controversial or unresolved questions) about the field. One of the best things about this course, in fact, was being able to learn about research that is ongoing, conflicted, and surprising  that is, to get an insider view of the science unfolding. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is an excellent opportunity to participate in fascinating conversations with creative minds (instructors and students alike) about clinical psychology and neuroscience. The environment of the class, too, is approachable and welcoming to people from a wide range of backgrounds. "
