            "\u00a0I gained a good knowledge of beginning intermediate russian, and now have the ability to read some short stories and songs. ",
            "\u00a0A much higher understanding of Russian vocabulary and grammar. Even more so than L1, I came out with pretty good conversation skills and so much appreciation for Russian (though of course we still have a long way to go). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Russian language, and Russian culture. ",
            "\u00a0This was my second semester of Russian at Yale. RUSS 120 was a natural continuation of RUSS 110 and felt the same way - efficient. I would never believe, one can learn a foreign language so quickly!\r\nAfter one year, I can confidently say, I learned how to speak, write, listen, and read Russian according to the expectations set. ",
            "\u00a0Russian language skills ",
            "\u00a0This course develops basic grammar in Russian, key vocabulary, and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the grammar and vocabulary structures necessary to properly express yourself at the intermediate level in Russian. "

            "\u00a0The course is helped by nightly homework that keeps the student engaged. So, too, do the tests. I don't have any suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: homeworks are not super structured and occasionally the tests felt a little bit out of nowhere (however no assignment is weighed too heavily so you will always have room for error). \r\n\r\nStrengths: community, awesome language, lets you do St. Petersburg (do it), Julia is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0wonderful class! ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: although this is not a big one, I would maybe appreciate a little bit more practice of the new material. Sometimes it felt like we only flew over it and in consequence, forgot it in a matter of a few days. Or maybe slow down a little bit (cut down one chapter and spread the time throughout the semester) \r\n\r\nStrengths: excellent language course! It is highly efficient and one can really learn the language if they put the work in it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class include the daily homework, which keeps you practicing the language at home; the helpfulness of the TFs and Prof. Titus; and the daily speaking practice in class. The course is a lot of work, but that work is really necessary if you want to learn Russian. Other than that, no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0S: daily homework and weekly tests, two teachers (TA and professor)\r\nW: oral speaking feedback limited to an oral midterm and oral final "

            "\u00a0I would. Russian is a wonderful language to learn at Yale, and the teaching staff is spectacular! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you started Russian, you should definitely, definitely continue it. Perhaps if you didn't really like it you could switch teacher (Julia and Tatiana [who will at least teach the other class for the next year] have different styles) or talk to a TA and discuss what the problem is; however, it's such a rewarding language and with L2 in particular your skills will go up. Plus St. Petersburg is absolutely incredible. Personally I love languages and I've come to love Russian culture a lot but I'd still recommend it. The class is a riot, and people really bond in it. \r\n\r\nHowever, particularly if you haven't started Russian yet: Russian is a language for people who love logic and . Comparatively little memorization, especially since the class doesn't focus that much on vocabulary, so you won't be doing a lot of flashcards and memorizing, but the language has rich and complex grammatical structures. Be ready to think critically about the grammar; if you just try to memorize every construction, things won't work out, but if you come to fully understand the grammar, you'll love it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor is very caring, and my language skills improved tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely yes. Russian is/ will be extremely helpful in the future especially in the business and political spheres. It is also the language of the poetry, and the ability to speak Russian will let one uncover the hidden beauty of Russian authentic masterpieces. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, while it was a lot harder than L1 it was still a good class to learn Russian. I think I learned the most in this class out of all the classes I took. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Russian is a wonderful language, and Julia is an incredibly enthusiastic and dedicated teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend! We need more people in this world who speak Russian. You will have so much fun in this class with Prof. Titus, and you will learn an amazing language. "
