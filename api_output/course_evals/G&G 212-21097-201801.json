            "\u00a0A lot of knowledge about tectonic processes. It also gave me a bit of an overview for how plate tectonics informs and fits in with the rest of geology. I also gained a ton of practical skills and field skills in geology by going on the trip! This class gave me more confidence in doing field work and more insight into the solid earth part of geology in general. ",
            "\u00a0how to break down technical scientific concepts & work through jargon ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great course that has a lot of exciting/cool information about how the surface of the planet formed.  There's a lot of jargon, and a lot of nerdiness, but it's fantastic.  Basically, you learn the basics of a lot of aspects of plate tectonics, with a bit more of a focus on mountain-building in the second half to prepare for the final project. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of the main processes governing tectonics and paleogeographic reconstruction. The problem sets introduce you to a lot of the research methods and data used in geology and the field trip to field geology methods. ",
            "\u00a0I developed some understanding of how tectonic processes (plate motion in subduction, obduction, rifting, etc.) work both locally/regionally, and globally.\r\nWe were taught the causes of plate motion and the basic composition of Earth's rocks at many different scales of magnification. We also learned various methods of characterizing rocks across space and time (metamorphic studies using isotopic dating, paleomagnetics), and we tried to summarize these various concepts by writing a final paper exploring a mountain range's formation and geology.\r\n\r\nI also got to travel with David Evans and my G&G 212 class to Spain, where I learned how to perform basic aspects of geological mapping (deciding scales, taking strikes and dips, identifying rocks and describing regional structures, etc.). ",

            "\u00a0strengths: I enjoyed the p-sets, lectures were pretty good but sometimes not well coordinated between the two profs. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: I didn't enjoy the final paper or find it super helpful. I also think I learned less during the second half, when we didn't have psets. ",
            "\u00a0As a student, I thought it was great.  As a person who likes to learn, I found it difficult near the end to really focus on the material/take good notes, after we'd finished psets, since there were no exams.  Again, this was both good and bad, as it made the last half of my semester much easier and took a lot of pressure off, but also in another world I would love to come out of the class with more lasting knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Our 2 weeks in Spain were an incredible highlight of the class - all the sites we surveyed were fascinating and a great introduction to field geology. I wish there had been a little less theory/lecturing on the field trip and more fieldwork, and it would have been helpful to breakdown the information given by our guides in simpler terms because I didn't always understand the bigger picture or significance of what we were looking at. I also wish some of the concepts brought up in lecture were explained a little more in depth and that the lectures were better connected with each other. The final paper and presentations also felt very rushed at the end of the semester and I wish we had received more feedback. But aside from that the class was wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a first-year thinking of majoring in geology and geophysics. It was my first course in g&g and I was hoping it would provide a good, detailed introduction to the field -- it has. I believe that the main strength of this course lies in how it exposes students to many different aspects of lithiological g&g while still being introductory enough that people can take it as their first g&g class. I found the structure, lectures, and problem sets to be well structured and executed. David Evans has done a great job teaching the class. However, I think Alan Rooney will do a great job in teaching it to a new crop of g&g-ers.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint lies in the execution of the final paper -- it felt rushed and possibly overambitious, given the students' amount of exposure to the material and time around finals period. Also, David Evan's detailed guidelines certainly helped in its eventual execution; the only issue was that it wasn't immediately apparent that the guidelines existed. As a result, my partner and I passed several weeks of time -- with the paper assigned -- less productively than we could have, given that we weren't following some of Professor Evans' detailed advice for how to write and research the paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging. The lectures were exciting and effectively communicated a lot of information about plate tectonics. More guidance on the final project would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course. It was exceptionally well taught, the lectures were interesting and accessible, and the curriculum was well-paced. No weaknesses at all. One of the best courses in the department. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students if you are at all invested in geology! The material is hard to get through if you are not. I found some of the class material boring/hard to get through but the field trip is so well-worth it and you will learn so much while in the field, everything makes more sense when you can see it and explore it in person. This definitely added to my understanding and appreciation of the geology of the solid earth. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, tectonics are super cool! ",
            "\u00a0YES.  TAKE IT.  This class was stress-free enough to really enjoy the material, but there was also enough material presented to be engaged and get into it.  This was a fairly off-beat topic for me (I'm not surprised I decided to take the class, but I wouldn't have unless I very much had the free time to do so this semester), and I totally loved it.  The level of intellectual challenge was just right, and I learned a lot about some really cool stuff that never would've come up in my life otherwise.  The field trip is also epic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in large scale tectonic processes as well as some of the research methods used in geology. I did not take the recommended intro class prior to this course and in hindsight I wish I had because I would have gotten more out of this course and been able to participate and engage more with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend G&G 212 to other students interested in Geology and Geophysics. As I wrote above, it is accessible but comprehensive and detailed (like all good science!). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! I learned a lot and really enjoyed the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I loved every class. It was interesting, accessible, and well taught, and Dave Evans is so friendly and kind. The spring break field trip to Spain was one of the highlights of my time at Yale. Take this class regardless of whether you're a G&G major or not!!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun. Even if you're not a geology major, you will get a lot out of this class (especially if it's taught by Prof. Evans). I didn't go on the trip to Spain, and I still thought the class was worth it. "
