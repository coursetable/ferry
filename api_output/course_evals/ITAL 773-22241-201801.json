Prof. Ballerini is very knowledgeable and illustrates many points with examples from literature. I found his interpretations of the literary pieces he read very strong. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to an undergraduate with a good knowledge of Italian and of the modern history of Italy. I would recommend this knowledge, because we read works of literature of an advanced level of Italian and because the literature was specific to the historical periods we discussed, such as Italy before, during and after WWII, particularly in the '60s and '70s.
