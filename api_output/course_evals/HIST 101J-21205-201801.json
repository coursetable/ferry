            "\u00a0As a historian, I sharpened my primary source analysis skills. Prof. Lynn was an excellent teacher in that regard, helping me find thoughtful and incisive ways to analyze historical evidence I had accumulated about my topic. I also learned how to think fast on my feet in seminar, making more compelling contributions as the semester went along. Finally, I think I have developed a strong understanding of American Conservatism, which was the main topic of the class. ",
            "\u00a0In Professor Lynn's course, I improved my ability to work with both primary and secondary sources. This class was one of the first I have taken at Yale to rely so heavily on primary sources, and I think my ability to interpret them improved significantly throughout the semester. I also learned how to set different secondary sources in contrast to each other. I also took many insights from the material itself. I gained a greater appreciation for the complexities and nuance in American conservatism and conservatism in general. I better understand complex questions like what does it mean to be conservative and what different strands are in the conservative tradition. In an era in which conservatives are battling over what there movement stands for, these questions are particularly important. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the history of American conservatism and American thought in general. ",
            "\u00a0Such an amazing overview of American Conservatism. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a comprehensive overview of the history of the conservative intellectual and cultural tradition in the US. I walked away with a significantly more nuanced understanding of why certain conservative beliefs are held today (abortion, welfare etc.) and how these ideas evolved from a broader tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I have not taken another course which so drastically influenced how I perceive politics. I won't say I am any more right-leaning or left-leaning than before the course, but I know of few people who can describe the creation of the American Right, its uses of conservatism, and the word's role in American politics over time better than students who have taken this class. That includes politicians, academics, and popular pundits. It is somewhat remarkable how comfortable I became in discussing conservatism as both a philosophical idea and a cultural mood in so little time. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of American conservatism \r\nDeep understanding of themes through American conservatism to the present\r\nthe meaning of American conservatism\r\nreading and writing skills\r\nusing primary source documents to make an argument\r\nUsing primary source and secondary source documents to inform each other. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the canon of American conservative thought and the historiography surrounding American conservatism. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a fundamental understanding of the course of American political history through the context of developments in conservative thought. ",
            "\u00a0Above all, I gained the vocabulary and the historical framework to talk about the vague and amorphous force called \"conservatism.\" Part of this came from traditional sources of political theory and philosophy; I gained exposure to Edmund Burke's writing and ideas as well as the political thought of John Calhoun, Russell Kirk, and others. But this course also showed me that conservatism is much more than that; we gleaned insights about conservatism from cultural sources like songs and movies and we considered applying the \"conservative\" label to many people and events that one wouldn't think of as conservative. This class did a really good job of teasing out the roots and long continuities in conservative thought and practice. I learned about the intersections between conservatism and slavery, race, gender, and pop culture. Above all, this class made me ask more questions -- about conservatism, about history, and about memory. It made me ask foundational questions about the United States -- its origins, its legacy, its historical trajectory. I learned that there was, indeed, a \"long\" history of American conservatism, and that forces you to reconsider a lot of the assumptions you have made about the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the skills perspective, this course helped teach me about how to read and analyze primary sources and how to conduct a large research project with primary sources contextualized in secondary-source historiography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much more about the long history of American conservatism-- about its American uniqueness, about the rhetoric wielded, about its incoherence or continuity, about its problematic history with race and ethnicity. Prof. Lynn was also so helpful in getting me to interrogate my writing and thinking, and his feedback was consistently helpful in helping me reshape my writing. "

            "\u00a0I believe the main weakness of the course was that it was not diverse enough. I wish there had been more people that were not straight white males. I think this is not the fault of the professor at all -- the course, by its nature, attracts that demographic by itself. But there must be a way to improving it: I think it will improve class discussions even more. \r\n\r\nThis weakness -- though significant -- does not detract from the many strengths of this course. Though the students lacked in diversity, they were overall very strong intellectually, and conversations were always probing and interesting. The professor was a master at guiding conversations about and around sensitive political topics, particularly in the current climate. The readings were well-chosen and reasonably paced, I particularly liked the mixture of secondary and primary material. I found the assignments challenging, but in a really satisfying and productive way. For these reasons, I think the History of American Conservatism as taught by Prof. Lynn was one of the strongest history seminars I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include Professor Lynn's ability to lead an engaging discussion and the reading list. The course readings are just the right length (very rich but manageable to complete in a week). One weakness of this course is that it sort of skimmed over conservatism from the Civil War until the 1950s. The snowstorm that cancelled the week of the course focused on these 100 years contributed to this, but even without the snowstorm, I feel like the course jumped from Calhoun to communism and I imagine there is more than just a week's worth of discussion in between these two eras. I also feel that students would get even more out of the seminar if it was smaller (21 students is a lot). ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. I would skip the student presentations of authors and replace it with either another short assignment or a presentation on another interesting topic that's more formal. ",
            "\u00a0Sooooo good. Cannot recommend enough. Sad that Professor Lynn is leaving. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall an excellent class. The readings (and movies!) were all well chosen, and having the secondary sources each week to complement the primary sources was helpful in providing a framework with which to understand the ideas being presented in the actual documents we analyzed. I enjoyed the group work that we did with the Story and Laurie documents near the end of the semester, and would have loved some similar breakout discussions at the beginning of the semester as well both to more organically share ideas and to get to know my classmates better. It may sound a bit excessive, but I've found in classes where professors have taken their students out to dinner near the beginning of the semester, the camaraderie among the students feeds into more animated discussions and creates a closer cohort of students. Some sort of activity like this may be worth including in the future. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the course and class discussions was for the most part very well done. I found the idea of having students preview the following week's readings through presentations to be a good idea in theory, but very challenging in practice, as it was difficult to read two weeks worth of materials in addition to preparing a presentation. In a seminar I took fall semester, the professor had students present on the current weeks readings at the beginning of the class to set up the discussion that would follow, which I found to be an effective method. \r\n\r\nWithin the discussions themselves, I thought Professor Lynn did an excellent job not only in articulating some of the key ideas to keep in mind with the current week's readings, but also in connecting the current literature to previous works we'd read, getting us in the habit of applying certain conservative's ideas and framework to whatever document we were working with. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lynn is a brilliant seminar leader, and discussions were frequently riveting and sometimes even electrifying. The readings were almost uniformly excellent from week to week. I can only think of two \"weaknesses,\" really. First, I wish that there had been some sort of obligatory forum posts before class--nothing big, just something brief to help you better organize your thoughts before seminar. Second, and this is really a minor one considering the ambitious scope of the course, but I wanted us to touch on some of the corners of American conservatism that don't always get a hearing in the classroom, like Ayn Rand. But that's really it. ",
            "\u00a0Good teacher, well-designed syllabus with clear themes. Good readings. Not many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered a well-refined syllabus with a good array of secondary readings and primary source material. I appreciated that the course explored conservative culture as well as conservative politics and highlighted issues of race and gender. I also thought that the seminar included a good mix of students with diverse political opinions although I would have preferred greater gender and racial heterogeneity among the students selected for the class. I also think the course would have benefited from including fewer students. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well led in discussion and allowed for everyone to participate. Conversations were interesting and productive to answering the key question of what defines American conservatism. Reading assignments were never too strenuous and the overall workload of the course was very manageable. The only negative comment on the class that I have to offer is that the final paper topic may have been too broad of an assignment, and I think that I would have benefitted from a more narrow question instead of an open-ended topic. ",
            "\u00a0The only weaknesses I can think of are that the first two weeks on political theory/philosophy are relatively not as engaging as the rest of the course, and that I think it was a little bit larger than the ideal size for a seminar (because Professor Lynn is so popular!). Going forward, I would say 15 or 16 is a better size than 19 or 20. The larger size makes it a little harder for everyone to get involved and causes fewer people to end up talking more  in a slightly smaller class, I think everyone ends up contributing more and the discussion is better.\r\n\r\nThat said, this course was my favorite of the semester, and there really isn't much I would change. The readings are diverse and fascinating. The topic is engaging and not well-studied at Yale. The applications of the course material are never-ending. The discussion forced me to open my mind to new opinions and to ask questions I would not have otherwise considered. This course does a great job of being both focused on a specific topic while addressing a long period in history. Professor Lynn is a superb leader of discussions. Moreover, he did a great job compiling a syllabus with a wide range of sources  from formal political theory to political speeches to cartoons, songs, and movies. In this way, Professor Lynn not only opened my mind to new intellectual questions and ideas, but to new approaches to the discipline of history (and specifically political history). The research project is rewarding and fulfilling, and each seminar discussion was thought-provoking. This is a great class with a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0The material was really fascinating, and Prof. Lynn was such an interesting and engaged discussion leader. My only problems are below, with the discussion sometimes getting a bit confusing + muddled. Also, I'd really love to see more + more engaged women in the class-- was a bit odd to see a seminar of 20 with only 3/4 women, and I think it limited the potential diversity of views. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course. I think the only slight tweak I would make is to draw make more explicit how is to spend a bit more time in the later weeks of the course looking back in time and drawing more connections with some of the earlier material. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is well taught, well structured, and of paramount importance following Trump's election. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other students at Yale. Many of the authors we read are rarely discussed in your typical Yale course, but have ideas that are worthy of your attention regardless of your political views. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Definitely one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Lynn is fantastic and the readings are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If Joshua Lynn ever comes back to Yale, take his course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! So good! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! Unfortunately, Professor Lynn is leaving this year, but I hope the history department continues to teach this course with his input. From the structure of the course to the readings to the discussions, it was an incredibly engaging and stimulating class that challenged many of the preconceived notions that I'd had about conservative thought prior to entering the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is a gem. You're unlikely to get this kind of exploration of American conservatism elsewhere, and you'd be remiss to pass on this. The course is, at times, slightly hobbled by the sheer ambition of its scope, but Professor Lynn has compiled a syllabus so strong and well-structured that he mostly pulls it off. The readings are fascinating, the seminar discussions enlightening, and ultimately you'll come away from this course with a depth of understanding about conservatism that simply can't be gleaned from the partisan mud-slinging that passes as discussion in our media (and government). You'll get to read the work of some of the most well-known conservative speakers/leaders and some of the more obscure, all while tracing how American historians have dealt with documenting the American conservative phenomenon. Lynn wants you to understand not just how American conservatism has evolved, but how academic understandings of it have evolved as well. The result is a course that revels in intellectual richness. \r\n\r\nThe workload is perfectly manageable (two short essays, a presentation, and one final paper) and frequently fun, as Lynn allows and even encourages you to really stretch your thinking when writing these papers, so you can indulge your more esoteric intellectual interests if you can demonstrate that they something meaningful about American conservatism. It's rewarding stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in understanding the American political system, it is useful to understand conservatives or populations not normally represented at Yale. There is a lot of intellectual history in this course, especially in the beginning. Later on in the course, there is the opportunity to learn about how the history can explain the resurgence of elements of conservatism in the present. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Professor Lynn is incredibly thoughtful and genuinely cares about what students think of various readings. He offers clear feedback on writing assignments and helps his students become better historians and academics more generally. I also believe that learning the roots of contemporary American conservatism in a controlled, scholarly setting is incredibly important for any student interested in pursuing politics. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student if they were strongly interested in American history or current political events. I think that this class offers a great deal of insight into the ideologies of conservatives both in the past and in the present, and for that reason I think the class is helpful in understanding the viewpoints of many contemporary politicians. Analyzing trends in conservative ideologies throughout the course of American history provides a great way to view how we have arrived at the state of the current American government and two-party system. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Lynn is a great professor and is truly dedicated to both his discipline and his students. The topic of conservatism is, of course, relevant to the present moment, but it is also a really vibrant subject for historians at the moment. The seminar does a great job of touching on a lot of different aspects and angles of conservatism, from intellectual history to political and cultural history and from the lenses of race, gender, class, and ethnicity. Every discussion is thought-provoking, and there is a lot of flexibility in the final research project to come up with a rewarding topic for primary source research. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and it opened my mind to new ideas and to new questions to ask about history and the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was easily one of my favorite this semester,  and all of Yale. I came into the course with an interest in examining the intersection of conservatism and race-- and I was not disappointed. I feel like I've only just begun to understand the fascinating constructions of whiteness in America. But also, I've learned about the really interesting questions surrounding the nature of American conservatism, its uniqueness, its democratic bent in many ways, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course and a fabulous instructor. "
