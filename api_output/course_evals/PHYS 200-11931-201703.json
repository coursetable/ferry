            "\u00a0This course gave be a good understanding of mechanics (a classic first semester physics subject) but also of other topics including relativity and thermodynamics. Solving the problems presented in this course definitely improved my ability to think critically and take into account a wide range of information. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class to take if you already have some knowledge of physics (e.g., having taken other classes with physics or if you took AP Physics C Mech. in high school). ",
            "\u00a0This class opened up a whole new world of math and physics for me. Part of the reason for this is that I was a class behind the prerequisites in math (I had to pick up Euler's identity, partial differentiation, etc. along the way), but Professor Poland did an exceptional job of explaining the ways of the world, step-by-step. When we started doing imaginary numbers, things got a little complicated and I lost him at times, but overall he made physics very understandable. ",
            "\u00a0We covered all of mechanics in detail, introductory special relativity, waves, and thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of mechanics with some interesting topics thrown in at the end. The first half was a review of high school mechanics but I learned some higher level mathematical physics with oscillators and waves, and got a good introduction to special relativity. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skill in solving physics problems and learned the basics of calculus-based physics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques for solving mechanics, special relativity, and thermodynamics problems, including some calculus techniques. Through these kinds of problems, I learned more general methods for mathematically modeling real-world problems. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very good physics class for students who have already taken a fair amount of physics in high school. It covers topics that may already be familiar but in significantly more depth and with more calculus involved. ",
            "\u00a0I had already taken AP physics C, so the majority of the new topics I learned were in the second part of the course, namely special relativity and thermodynamics. Although, it was sometimes helpful to get second and third presentations of the same information. ",
            "\u00a0The course helped me gain a better and more nuanced understanding of various physical concepts, and improved my ability to solve mathematical problems. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot of advanced physics and am better prepared for future physics courses! ",
            "\u00a0I expanded my knowledge of the fundamentals of physics and learned how to work on difficult problems with my fellow students ",
            "\u00a0This class enhanced my ability to reason quantitatively like no class before. The problem sets and tests were very stimulating and pushed me to think creatively. It also forced me to become comfortable with math I have not learned yet. At first I thought this was a flat of the course, but now realize it's essential to the class's material and challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of mechanics and special relativity and had a chance to solidify concepts that I had somewhat grasped previously while learning new concepts such as special relativity and simple harmonic motion. ",
            "\u00a0Learned kinematics and waves in a much more in-depth level than I did in AP Physics I or II. Also learned how to really do psets and solve problems. Great first semester freshman class, very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Taking PHYS 200, I learned fundamental concepts in physics, including kinematics, thermodynamics, fluid properties, special relativity and harmonic motion. I learned about deriving formulas that are used in the physical world, and how these formulas were developed over time. Although the concepts were interesting, the way the course set up did not facilitate student learning. I feel what I learned in class was too far in depth than what was required for the exams. Obviously, I hope the test do not get harder, but the lectures should demonstrate the proficiency needed for the exams. But, to play devil's advocate, the lectures were intriguing (at times), and it was interesting to see where the equations came from and to solve thought experiments in class (in reference to special relativity). ",
            "\u00a0My problem solving skills were definitely improved by this course. I learned much better how to use tools to solve a problem, rather than just going through the motions like in high school classes. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a solid understanding of the basics of physics on an undergraduate level, including kinematics, statics, oscillators, waves, and thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work on problems for a long period of time which required excellent motivation skills. I also learned how to approach problems from multiple angles. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the only skill I developed was how to annoy my TA into helping me and a group of equally confused peers solve problem sets that had nothing to do with what we were taught in class, or that was in our textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamentals of Physics is an excellent introduction to Classical mechanics and special relativity. Shankar's book is quite well-written and concise ",
            "\u00a0Does exactly what it says on the tin. First semester mechanics and a little thermodynamics, basically the same content as AP physics C with a little extra calc. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course was a review of AP Physics C that I took in high school, and the second part completed the fundamentals of physics that were missing from the AP curriculum. "

        [
            "\u00a0Very poorly taught course. The lectures focused solely on deriving equations but not what the equations meant or how to apply the equations. The psets were very challenging and not related to lectures at all. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course is very interesting, and we cover everything with enough time to make it all readily understandable. The pacing of this course is good, although it sometimes seems that the topics are a bit arbitrarily chosen and largely disconnected from one another. ",
            "\u00a0This class NEEDS example problems to be done in class.\r\nMuch of the class is spent deriving formulas that will be used on the problem set, but there are almost no application problems presented in class. Application problems worked in class with real-life scenarios like those in the problem sets would improve this class greatly. ",
            "\u00a0While the course covers a lot of interesting material, it felt like there was one too many topics for us to really understand everything we covered. I feel like we only got half an understanding of thermodynamics, and given the challenge of some earlier topics such as harmonic oscillators it might have been smart to drop one of the two and spend more time focusing on the other.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wish that there was more practice materials available for each examespecially because the textbook doesn't have practice problems, releasing a couple of old exams isn't sufficient to really let you review individual topics the way that extra problems would. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great class. The only thing I would say is to either a) review some math concepts that are not taught until MATH 120 before they're used or b) don't recommend MATH 115 students for PHYS 200. This was my situation heading into the semester, and the DUS for Physics said I could do both. I could and I did, but a few matrix, differential equation, and imaginary number operations had me stuck on problem sets for hours at times. Still a great class though. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures emphasized the mathematical foundations of the physics at the expense of developing conceptual intuitions for the material. I don't think these two tensions need to be in conflict. I hope these two tensions can be reconciled in the next iteration of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are very challenging in the middle; they would probably be less difficult if we discussed more problem-solving applications in lectures instead of just mathematical derivations of the equations (which are interesting but can also be found in the textbook whereas it's really helpful to see example problems in class). The tests are much more simple and concrete than the lectures and psets, which sometimes included differential equations (which most students in the class hadn't studied) or tedious proofs/computation. The class could be improved by aligning the material in class with the psets and the tests to make it more cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0This class definitely encompasses a lot of material and challenges you to pursue self-study. A strength of this course is definitely the students taking it and the opportunities to work with them and learn; study sessions on weekday nights were incredibly helpful in terms of getting help and doing challenging psets.\r\n\r\n A weakness of this course is that there's so much material that is based on foundational knowledge that a lot of students don't know (like complex numbers, matrix multiplication, etc)- it was hard to learn how to do physics based on these concepts when most of us did not understand how complex numbers worked, for instance. ",
            "\u00a0The study halls are definitely the greatest strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The only things covered in class are the derivations of the formulas that you're going to need to use in your problem sets and tests.  There are also no discussion sections where you go over practice problems to learn how to apply the formulas successfully.  This course really throws you right into the deep end.  For me at least, the study halls three nights a week were essential for success on the problem sets, and I appreciate them immensely.  It would really benefit this course to have proper discussion sections and to go over sample problems in class. ",
            "\u00a0The material is well organized, and the lectures and textbook are easy to follow with plenty of examples included. I like that the problem sets include some exercises that go beyond what we learn in class -- the problems can be hard at first, but with some collaboration with classmates (which is encouraged) they never take too long.\r\n\r\nMy only disappointment is that the material often feels somewhat dull. The topics are not very closely connected to each other, and we focus on learning the right mathematical methods for each type of problem, rather than looking for connections at a conceptual level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned most of the material required for this course. I learned this mostly from other professors, the tfs, the peer tutors, or my fellow students. I really appreciated that the class wasn't flipped anymore. But because the format recently changed, there were very few materials to practice with for exams. For one unit and one of the hardest, simple harmonic oscillators, it hadn't been covered in previous and so there was no material with which to study for our exam. Another factor of this is the fact that our textbook has no problems in each section, Although the writing is very good and generally comprehensible, it would have been nice if Prof Poland could have suggested another textbook which would have good problems to practice with or switched the textbook entirely. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a wide variety of interesting topics in physics. It sometimes uses some mathematical concepts that most students in the class haven't been exposed to yet. ",
            "\u00a0it gave a useful overview of physics but I felt it lost any notion of meaning. My attraction to the subject is in its beauty and meaning and I had hoped that the deeper understanding and math would bring it out, instead I felt it was lost. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I benefitted from the frequency, length, and support from the tri-weekly physics study halls. I also heavily used the text book and youtube Shankar lectures to supplement my learning.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures progressed at a moderate to slow pace but were often hard to follow. I could trust that everything on the board would be true, but at the end of a lecture I would often be left wondering what was valuable or what I should take away from the class. I would have benefitted from the professor stepping back more often and telling us which equations and concepts were the most important and which were concepts that you only ever had to derive once and then you were done. Also, the psets and midterms were made unnecessarily more difficult because we never discussed problems in class. I would start the psets with no idea of what they would look like or how to solve them, and I would enter the midterms often only having seen a given problem type once or twice before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- The Study Hall and the review sessions were a very good idea, and I would have been bogged down multiple times in the course without the help of the TAs and Peer Tutors. It also helped me meet other members of the class and develop strong bonds while working together. Prof. Poland was also always very kind and good-natured, with a clear energy and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Some lectures became overly mathematical with far too much emphasis placed on mathematical proofs rather than an in-depth conceptual understanding. Certain concepts could have been broken down more for our benefit. Finally, I felt that some latter concepts (like fluids, for example) were rushed through. ",
            "\u00a0The one weakness I would say is that some of the material is not clear because it is taught in a slightly different way than the textbook which leads to some confusion since the lectures are not recorded anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0This course started out as all review from high school and then very abruptly switched to new challenging material. I would have been nice to have an intro physics course that was a direct continuation from ap physics c. ",
            "\u00a0We needed PHYSICAL examples explained in class. Everything we did was theoretical from harmonic motion on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Poland is a pretty good lecturer, but the book we use is amazing. Additionally, it's nice that Shankar's lectures are on youtube. He is truly an excellent resource for the class. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses of the course are that lectures in class can sometimes go over your head and you really need to sit down and study to understand what is being conveyed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the AWESOME teacher's assistants at study hall, the study halls themselves, Shankar's amazing textbook, and the interesting content of the course itself. \r\n\r\nWeakness is the professor. He is clearly extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and is a very kind person, but I rarely was able to understand lecture, no matter how hard I tried. The only way I learned in this class was through the textbook and through study hall. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness is how the midterms were graded. When I would look at the solutions online, I often couldn't tell where I went wrong to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the breadth of material in this course was large, but I wish we had gone a little deeper into some subjects. I also didnt feel like I really learned to think like a physicist. In other words, I dont feel like I better understand how to approach physics problems. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of derivations in this course, where we derive formulas in class, and then apply further knowledge to our problem sets (which proposes a great intellectual challenge). However, the exams are easier than the problem sets and lectures, and therefore the disparity between the lectures and exams are substantial. Therefore, I think the lectures should show the knowledge required for the exams. However, I though it was interesting (at times) where the equations came from, and how special relativity came about from though experiments. Also, it was a relief knowing all that was taught in lecture would not be on the exam. However, the lectures were ESPECIALLY important for the problem sets, which made up a significant portion of your grade. Therefore, the lectures were helpful for problem sets, but not exams. So, in essence, the problem sets apply the knowledge learned both in and out of the classroom, and if you review the material in lecture and problem sets, the exam would be easy: this is one strength of the course. Another strength of the course is the grading scale, where even if you do terrible on the final exam, you can still pull through the rest of the course just fine. Also, the ranges for overall scores are wide (90-100 is A, 80-89 is A-, etc.).\r\nOverall, the lectures cause you stress, the problem sets cause even more stress, and the exams are a nice breath of fresh air before the next unit. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it covers a wide range of material, from the basic principles of kinematics to simple harmonic motion. However, a greater focus on the processes involved in solving differential equations, and the theory behind them would have been more appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include the structure of the problem set questions, in that solving them will give the students the confidence to solve any other problems of that nature. Additionally, it gives the students a great opportunity to engage with one another in completing weekly problem sets. \r\nI found potential weaknesses in the class to be not including the real-world applications of many of the equations and concepts we discussed. I often found myself unsure of what we were trying to prove, what we were talking about, and getting thoroughly lost in a sea of variable that I did not understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course was generally easy to follow for someone having already completed AP Physics C, however the sudden need to derive solutions  to differential equations for oscillators and waves was challenging and at times frustrating. The course did not even suggest basic knowledge of differential equations as a prerequisite but the professor seemed to assume that all of the students were comfortable them. In future editions of the course, I believe more time being spent on teaching how to derive solutions to differential equations would be beneficial to most students taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus to the course is interesting however I did not overall enjoy the course. Although I had taken maths further maths and physics a levels, the most qualified I could be coming from the UK, I still found the transition difficult. I think that a high level of maths was assumed which was not even included in the 120 syllabus. Sometimes the problems were made so abstract that i did not learn anything. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs and peer tutors were very engaged and really helpful ",
            "\u00a0This class was very strange. I have studied all of this material before, so I understand a general trajectory that it should follow. This class did not follow that trajectory. It was taught in a desultory manner, discussing seemingly random material day in and day out. We had literally no access to practice problems unless we spent an extra $150 on an additional textbook, as the \"Shankar\" book we were instructed to use is essentially a transcript of Professor Shankar musing about Physics. Yes, I understand he is brilliant and his jokes are funny, but I actually wanted to learn how to solve problems. Lectures were essentially useless, as they consisted of Professor Poland rambling through proofs of often useless formulas. I couldn't tell if this class was trying to bolster our intellectually understanding of how the fundamentals of physics operate, or just give us a list of formulas to attempt to use, but it honestly did not succeed at either. \r\n\r\nI am baffled by how disorganized this class was. I hope this isn't representative of the entire Physics department. ",
            "\u00a0PHYS 200 would definitely be better if it went more slowly. Specifically, special relativity could be omitted as it is actually contradictory to classical mechanics. Then, the professor could spend more time on other topics so that students could grasp the material more fully. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets associated with the course were not easily understood through the lectures. The study halls were extremely helpful in getting through the material but I feel as though the lectures themselves could be improved if they were redesigned to help with the type of problems on the homework. ",
            "\u00a0Shankar's textbook is great, and whenever this course stuck to it, everything was mostly okay. The problems happened when we went off track or skipped chapters. At one point we were asked (without any math introduction) to solve partial differential equations involving complex numbers, which nobody in the class had ever seen before. Prof. Poland did one very rushed example in the last 5 minutes of class, then assigned it on a problem set. The pset was only doable after watching Prof. Shankar's lectures online, reading the textbook, and attending TA office hours.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Poland is not a great professor; expect to learn the content outside of class.

        [
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, take it. However this class makes interesting content seem boring and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to a student with decent preparation in physics who wants to cover more than just basic mechanics in a semester. If you think that the later material (relativity, waves, thermo) is interesting, than this is probably a good choice for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to non-STEM students. If you're interested in physics but don't need to take a physics class, I'd recommend making your life easier and taking 180/181.\r\nFor STEM majors, this is a good class to take as a transition from high school physics. ",

I can't speak to this class versus 260, but this class is probably good if you aren't planning to be a physics major but still want to have some in-depth understanding of mechanics.

It's not the most fascinating course around, but it presents the material in a clear and reasonably interesting way. Note that the course format significantly changed starting this semester, so don't worry too much about negative reviews from previous years. ",

It is not like the content is completely incomprehensible or the professor completely unhelpful, but compared to the other physics intro sequences, there is no reason why one should take 200 unless they have to.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in better understanding the fundamentals of physics. I would also recommend PHYS 260, however. I somewhat regret not taking 260 because I did not want to overwork myself, but in hindsight, I think it would have been a more interesting course. ",

I would not recommend to somebody who does not need to take the class or is taking it for a QR credit alone. The teacher makes it very difficult to learn in the class due to his teaching style. ",

From what I have heard (since I did not take the course), PHYS 260 is more interesting than PHYS 200, but also brings in a lot more math background (and a lot more physics background) than PHYS 200. However, if you have any doubt that you would not be able to keep up with the material of PHYS 200, then take PHYS 180. I have not heard much from PHYS 180 problem sets or exams, but the online course evaluations could give a better insight. However, the only reason to take PHYS 200 is for the grading curve and the slight intellectual challenge. But also heed my advice for PHYS 260. ",

If any of these things appeal to you by all means take this course. Here is my answer to a previous question that accurately summarizes this course:\r\n\r\nThis class was very strange. I have studied all of this material before, so I understand a general trajectory that it should follow. This class did not follow that trajectory. It was taught in a desultory manner, discussing seemingly random material day in and day out. We had literally no access to practice problems unless we spent an extra $150 on an additional textbook, as the \"Shankar\" book we were instructed to use is essentially a transcript of Professor Shankar musing about Physics. Yes, I understand he is brilliant and his jokes are funny, but I actually wanted to learn how to solve problems. Lectures were essentially useless, as they consisted of Professor Poland rambling through proofs of often useless formulas. I couldn't tell if this class was trying to bolster our intellectually understanding of how the fundamentals of physics operate, or just give us a list of formulas to attempt to use, but it honestly did not succeed at either.

            "\u00a0I would recommend PHYS 200 to any student who is interested in physics and with a strong mathematics/physics background who is not a physics major. ",
            "\u00a0If you have strong calc skills (enrolled in math 120, for example), this class is probably better than physics 180, because the physics gets much simpler once you can use calculus. On the other hand, the content of 180 and 200 are very similar, so you may be better off choosing based on the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Only to those who like physics a lot and have done AP Physics C, since I think others who have not will be overwhelmed or will need to work really hard. "
