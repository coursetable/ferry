            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different Behavioral Economics courses. ",
            "\u00a0You get to learn a lot about the interdisciplinary field of BE! ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, I better learned how to lift information from presentation-style learning and synthesize into analyses. The course was mostly taught by the individual students, with Professor Meneghel stepping in to tie points or topics together and ensure our deep understanding of behavioral economics. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this class, and feel like I have a better grasp of a wide variety of foundational topics in behavioral economics, as well as a better understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about many different topics under the umbrella of behavioral economics. ",
            "\u00a0Presentation skills ",
            "\u00a0A basic framework understanding of behavioral economics. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about a growing field of economics that is much more applicable and realistic than classical economic theory. In addition, you learn presentation skills as you present to the class. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough introduction to the field of behavioral economics from many perspectives (psychology, economics, marketing, and even biology!) ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various topics in Behavioral Economics, such as the endowment effect, the decoy effect, confirmation bias, ego depletion, anchoring, and more. "

        [
            "\u00a0Entirely student-run class because each class consists of 2 student presentations so whom you take the class with really shapes your experience of the course but that also means that it's easy to slack and take away close to nothing from the whole course. Your learning will depend entirely on how much commitment to the course you come with. ",
            "\u00a0An aspect of this course that could be considered both a strength and a weakness is the reliance on student-led presentations for a positive learning experience in the classroom. If the students presenting are not engaged or did not take a deep enough dive into their topic of choice, the experience may not be fulfilling for their peers; however, this was not a problem in our course this semester. I am also not a fan of the lack of feedback, or backloaded nature to the course with all of the papers having due dates within the last 2-3 weeks of the semester. Other than this, Professor Meneghel facilitated a wonderful course in which I learned a large amount of interesting material and enjoyed listening to my peers present on topics that excited them. ",
            "\u00a0Was a reverse classroom type setting where students lectured on different topics for the class period. It had a low workload, but engagement wasn't high for a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Meneghel is superb. The structure of the course is very relaxed, but you get to explore some really interesting topics. I can't say enough good things about this course ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the material, but the course could probably be a little more organized or cover more topics from the professor before student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course were the interesting concepts and the sheer number of topics we were able to cover. Weaknesses include the early Friday time slot and the fact that every class was student-led, as I would have loved to learn more from Professor Meneghel directly. "

            "\u00a0It's the guttiest of Econ classes and it fulfills your senior seminar requirement so yes, take it. Professor Meneghel is the sweetest Econ professor you will ever get to take a class with! ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a deeply interesting and informative style of teaching and learning that is a welcomed respite from typical course monotony. I feel like I utilized this course to my advantage, and left with an improved confidence in reading and analyzing economic literature. The course material is similar in scope to that of a psychology class, with a quantitative filter and analytical expectation layered on, and I loved the multidisciplinary lens this course took. ",
            "\u00a0Easy senior seminar with a really kind instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Idione is a sweetheart and the class is relaxed. however, the content is still very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0This class was 100% student presentations and there was no checkpoints to see if we were learning the material ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class ",
            "\u00a0NO! Unless you want to learn nothing and want low  workload ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend. This was a very interesting laid back seminar! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Very fun class with a manageable workload that mostly relied on class presentations and discussion afterwards ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is unlike any other Econ course Ive taken, and the most real-world-applicable Econ course Ive taken! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The most satisfying econ course I have taken. However, you will get out of the course exactly as much as you put in. Your grade consists of a presentation, two critical responses and a final paper. If you take those seriously and do a complex analysis, trying to understand research methodologies, find flaws in those and come up with improvements -- you will have a great learning experience and will be proud of your papers. Otherwise, I imagine, you won't find this course as engaging. The course is not stressful at all, but if you put in enough work into understanding of behavioral research papers, you will learn a lot. Also, Idione is very understanding and helpful. I wish there were more behavioral economics courses because it is a very trending field right now. "
