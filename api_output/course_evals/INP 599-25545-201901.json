            "\u00a0Strengths: for different topics, different expertise are invited to give the lecture. It is a good class to combine the Matlab and neuroscience.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the duration of the class is a little bit long, which may make it hard for students to focus on the lecture all the time. Perhaps divide one lecture into two each week. It is also a little hard for students who are not familiar with Matlab to catch the point in some advanced lectures. So maybe add more sessions about basic Matlab stills might be helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to someone who has already had some fundamental skills about Matlab, cuz the class goes through everything very quickly, it is a little hard for students who are not familiar with Matlab to catch the idea in the later advanced lectures. "
