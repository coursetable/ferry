            "\u00a0This course will give you a snapshot of the diversity of birds in the world and serves as a great compliment to the lecture by providing the phylogenetic perspective that the lecture doesnt. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about birds of the world including some that I didn't even know existed! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think like a taxonomist and make phylogenetic distinctions. After this lab it is definitely easier to think about evolutionary biology and contextualize the insights of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to identify the birds of the world by family, and I learning about a lot of interesting features of the phylogeny of birds. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the scientific names of nearly every family of birds and how to try identify them and specific morphological features in the lab and on field trips. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it really does what it says it will, which is give you an overview of bird diversity and provide you with bird identification skills. The weakness of this course is how much it demands from you: for a half credit, it asks a lot. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of memorization, which is necessary just because the class is about going through every single bird family. I don't really think this is possible but a lot of the species diversity are in the land birds clade, so they're also harder to identify. I almost wish we studied the land birds earlier instead of during the last month of class, just so we have the entire semester to get lots of time practicing identifying them. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting to me as a bird enthusiast, but it was extremely memorization-focused. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting lab but a lot of work. The field trips are also fun. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as a complement to the lecture, as it makes the lecture material much more meaningful because you actually get to see the birds you are talking about. However the course demands a lot from you, especially for a half course. Dont take this as your sixth or even fifth course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of work, just because there's no other way to do well other than to memorize ~150 bird  family names and what they look like. I would only take this class if you are absolutely interested in birds because that makes it fun. Otherwise, it can feel like you're just doing rote memorization. ",
            "\u00a0YES. a super cool half credit, even if you arent interested in birds (you will become incredibly interested in birds). youll come out of this with the ability to identify almost any family in the world. its an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but know what you are getting into-- you have one lab session to memorize so many specimens within a clade of birds, and even then there could be others on the tests that they don't put out for you! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in recognizing the birds of the world and informing your daily interactions with nature. While the lecture is far more intellectually stimulating, lab helps put a face to the name, although the process of familiarizing yourself with birds and committing them to memory is a difficult process. I wish I took it Credit/D to take off some of the pressure, but it was still a worthwhile course. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this class, but only to someone who has an interest in the different families of birds around the world. In short, I really enjoyed this class, but only because of my preexisting interest in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are willing to work hard. "
