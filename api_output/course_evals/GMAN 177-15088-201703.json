            "\u00a0I improved my skills of analysing the writings of various different authors. What I found very insightful was how we learned how to link the works of these different writers of different time periods together. ",
            "\u00a0My German language skills improve a lot over the course of the semester. This was the first L5 class I took at Yale, and I was nervous that the material would be too difficult for me to grasp. In the beginning it was challenging to understand the material we were reading, and I did not feel particularly confident speaking in class. Ultimately, I think the challenge this class presented made me engage with it more. I had to spend significant time reading, and translating, in order to understand the material. Having to put in this extra effort meant that I feel much more confident in my German speaking capabilities. \r\n\r\nMy knowledge of German film and literature has also grown greatly. I started German because I wanted to be able to read literature and philosophy in the original language. To get to take a class where I was actually able to do this was very exciting. Reading some texts I have read in translation, in the original German was great, and I think made me want to do more German in the future. \r\n\r\nThe combination of watching films and reading literature was great for getting to practice language skills by engaging with interesting content. I found this was of language learning much more engaging that learning Grammar rules, or simply practicing vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I read good German literature and watched equally good German movies in this class. In discussions, we focused on the way in which these works portray the state, but also covered stylistic choices and non-political themes. The course taught me exactly these points. How to view the state in media and which questions to ask when watching film or reading literature. My German essay writing skills improve do exponentially. ",
            "\u00a0I very significantly developed my level of skill in written German, as well as my spoken German ability. I also learnt a lot about the concept of the state, and really got to think deeply about topics about which I had never really thought before. ",
            "\u00a0A good overview of German film and literature of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This course improved my German language skills enormously, while also providing an excellent overview of German history, literature, and film. I was always excited to attend this course and I found it to be both rewarding and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my analytical skills and essay writing. I also learnt more about German culture. "

            "\u00a0I thought there were no real weaknesses of this course. It helped the students improve their German skills in all different ways; writing, reading, speaking, listening. The readings and movies were very interesting and applicable, and the workload fair. ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed to cater to people at a variety of German language levels. This dynamism was a great asset of the class, for me, as I was able to learn from people in the class who had much more German experience than me. \r\n\r\nI found the structure of the class very good as well. I enjoyed reading and watching films on alternate weeks, as well as the weekly video journal posts. I also found writing the three papers for the class helped me to engage with the material. I really liked that we had the opportunity to submit multiple drafts, as this provided us with the chance to go back and improve our language and recognize common mistakes. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to have learnt more vocabulary in the course. The vocal quizzes were small enough that we could have had more of them. Maybe very small weekly quizzes would have made me learn more vocabulary throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Going in to the class I did not realize just how much this course emphasizes the state. I was looking forward to reading more exciting classic German novels. A lot of he reading however is political philosophy or similar. Be ready to read what is called Amtsdeutsch  the most difficult German dialect. \r\n\r\nWith weekly Videoo Journals and discussion, the class felt pretty engaging. Personally what I take out of this course mostly are the essay writing skills that this course provided me with. Writing an 8-10 page final paper in German really forces you to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I was glad to have read many of the course readings. Particularly, I really enjoyed reading Hannah Arendt, Christa Wolf and Kafka. I also thought that the readings from Schmitt were valuable additions to the course. I thought the selection of films was also excellent. Although some students found films such as Gefngnisblider and Deutschland im Herbst confusing, I thought they were valuable additions to the course, since they got us to analyze an unconventional type of film. I also thought that they both addressed very interesting subjects. Overall, I really liked the system of having weekly video journals since they got me to consolidate my thoughts before I came to class and also generally helped me practice spoken German outside of class. I thought the discussions in class were very fruitful and enjoyable. I had a lot of fun in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Conversation was at times a bit slow. Levels of German abilities varied greatly. The texts and films were at times difficult as a non-native speaker ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be very beneficial for my German language abilities, as it provided an opportunity to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing. At the same time, the course avoided any sense of monotony by focusing on a number of literary works and films which were engaging and fun to discuss. The course does have a degree of \"make-work\" which, while not overly dull, does break the pace slightly in comparison to the fascinating discussions and works. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: gives a good overview of German literature, engaging classes "

            "\u00a0Yes, I loved discussing topics presented by both film and literature. Class discussions were always engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would greatly recommend this course to another student, who is interested in German culture and the German language. It has the perfect learning environment, as it is a small class, and the readings are not too long, and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in taking German for the literature it gives you access to, then you should definitely take this class. I so enjoyed the material, and found the workload manageable, while the content remained challenging. I have not taken many other high level German classes, but I can imagine that I will not find one better than this very soon. High recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I took this course first-semester freshman year. I think I was disappointed in it because I didnt understand the emphasis that this course had on the state. I guess this advise may be obvious to more experienced Yalies... Read the syllabus and look into the movies and literature before you decide to take the class. If you Areva satusfied by the syllabus, you will most likely be satisfied by the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students to are interesting in developing their German skills from an intermediate to an advanced level. (Maybe with 3 to 4 years of high school German or the equivalent.) I do not recommend this course to native German speakers. Take this course if you are interested in film and literature, and enjoy discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Great collection of interesting texts and films that I enjoyed reading and discussing. I would recommend this class if you want to expand you German readings abilities and become more familiar with influential modern German texts ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to German speakers with a good grasp of the language. It will improve your German skills while also providing engaging discussions and interesting questions that are very fascinating in either language. I enjoyed the course quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It's very engaging, and you really improve your language and writing skills. "
