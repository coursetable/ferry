            "\u00a0I definitely more comfortable in how I approach math problems in a logical manner. I no longer just give up the second I look at it. This class has taught me to break problems down and look at the pieces before the whole. ",

            "\u00a0The homework seemed impossible to do unless you went to office hours. The worksheets in class were far too easy when compared to the homework. We should have been challenged in class more so we werent completely lost during homework. ",
            "\u00a0Had to get a tutor to pass. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a good introduction to basic Calculus and a great refresher of Algebra. The weekly workshops and daily office hours were definitely the best part of this entire course. Since class-time was so short and there were only a certain amount of topics the professor can go over in one lecture, the workshops and office hours definitely helped to ensure that I grasp on to what was taught in lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: the homework did not reflect what was taught in class. Sometimes the TAs were not able to figure out some of the homework problems either. I think more class time should be spent teaching instead of doing problems that professors never have time to go over anyways. As a result, we never know if we are on the right track ",

            "\u00a0I think that it was taught in a way that I understood pretty well, but might not work best for other people. I prefer to have things thoroughly explained to me rather than to be handed a formula. Sometimes, I felt that lecturing took on a big part of the class time, however. There also wasn't much students engagement in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: In my opinion, professor Gabriel Bergeron-Legros always clearly taught us the new material. Also, I really liked the printed notes as they allowed me to focus more on him rather than taking the notes. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there was more of a \"class interaction,\" or more practice problems to help us understand the new material. ",

My high school did not teach me in the most efficient way, so .I understand a lot more after this class. I think going over the foundations of calculus is important to do before jumping in. I recommend the idea of this class, but I am not so sure about the execution. ",
