            "\u00a0Made me think about movies in a different way. Insightful knowledge on movie structure and how to plan out a successful movie. There is more focus on the planning and less focus on the actual writing. Still come away with at least the first 15 minutes of a movie (about 15 pages of a screenplay), which is really exciting, and Professor Price provides great feedback on all assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the classic arc of a story and the necessary structural elements, character, and dialogue to make a story engaging. I loved that we based our study of what makes a good story on Aristotle's Poetics. This course helped me hone in on how to tell an exciting story and the necessity of a strong emotional appeal to make it exciting. Everything has to be bigger in a story, more exaggerated, etc. I also learned a lot about the film industry in Hollywood, which I found incredibly valuable. I haven't had courses that are so industry based before, and I loved writing a play that was with a practical audience in mind (agents and producers/the American public), which I think helped me developed a concrete, amusing story that could ultimately be sold. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the foundations of writing screenplays and what it is like to work in the film industry. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a comprehensive intro into screenwriting, which really gave great examples of how to approach writing a screenplay and how to organize one's process. It was an excellent, real-world class with a lot of personal feedback and set students up to continue writing a feature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the process of writing a screenplay from logline to script, the structure of a screenplay, how to format it, and a little about how to sell one. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the process and art of screenwriting as well as how Aristotle's writings tie into modern storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about something I knew nothing about and have a new appreciation for screenwriting ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! Cannot recommend enough for beginning screenwriters or just anyone interested in general. I gained valuable skills both as a screenwriter and a storyteller. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skills to analyze, critique, and learn from films for their screenplays.  We also went through the whole process of writing a screenplay from start to finish, including where to start and how to follow through if you're interested in writing professionally. ",
            "\u00a0A strong understanding of the structure and mechanics of writing a screenplay. The class taught me exactly what I had hoped for; significant, practical skills in screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the structure and process of writing a feature length film, and how to be more critical about my own work. I also learned a bit about the business and logistics of trying to enter the entertainment industry. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-learned a lot about how to structure a movie\r\n-learned about how some of Aristotle's ideas apply today to film\r\n-learned a bit about writing a screenplay\r\n-learned a lot about what makes a movie good and the ingredients necessary to make your movie good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-not as much time as I thought focused on actually writing your screenplay (only the last couple of classes) ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength of this course the organization of the assignments. Starting with the logline and going through the writing process all the way to part of the script was really well done. Each exercise built nicely open each other and made the transition to more specific content natural.\r\n\r\nI wish sometimes we had watched more clips to see examples of what we were discussing or done some more reading of each other's work instead of hearing what worked from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very helpful personal feedback from Professor Price; workshops also help you improve your screenplay\r\nWeaknesses: The class moves rather slowly, until the last three or four weeks; it would be great if the first half of the semester could be sped up a bit! ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was really well designed and taught. I loved having the structure through which to plan out a screenplay, which forced me to think about my own idea in a more organized and clear way, if sometimes formulaic. I think it could have been fun to read more screenplays throughout, but the homework level was the perfect amount of engaging work so I would be wary of adding too much more. All in all, it was a great entry point into screenwriting and I learned a LOT. I also loved reading my classmate's work and getting to give and receive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were Professor Price who is very knowledgeable about screenplays and provided excellent feedback on our writing submissions. Class time was fully utilized and each day had a clear focus and intent. In terms of weaknesses, maybe I came in with false expectations, but I thought this course was supposed to be a writing course; however, I found it to be much more of a film studies course. The majority of our time was spent on the structural beats of a screenplay, which are undeniably important, but I think it meant the workshop structure was wasted because we didn't get to read anyone's writing until the very end. I expected to learn how to write a scene or strong dialogue or how to reveal a character through his/her/their actions instead of through description, but again, the only instruction I felt we got on this was through the feedback on our submissions at the end. It's still a worthwhile course, but it wasn't the writing seminar I expected. ",
            "\u00a0The small size facilitated nice discussion, got to watch and read some great screenplays, and learned a lot from Prof. Price and fellow classsmates. The course did feel a little disjointed since it only met once a week. Moreover, it would have been nice to start on the screenplays earlier so as to get to write more (only wrote the first 15 pages total) and to get to workshop more. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect as is, a great low workload but highly engaging first pass at learning the craft of screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very fun class, with the right pace and a very manageable workload.  You learn a lot, but you only get however much you put into it. I really liked the analysis we did of storytelling in connection to Aristotle from the beginning, and I think it could be better if a little more time was spent on both that analysis and how to write good dialogue, since I feel like writing the actual scenes was a little rushed at the end. ",
            "\u00a0It's very well planned and laid out. The progression of the class is logical and well-paced. Your skills build and build along with your assignments until you are left with a fully structured screenplay with 15 pages written out. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very engaged and has a lesson clearly planned for each class. I do feel that we should have spent more time workshopping, maybe in smaller groups or with the entire class. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in screenwriting or storytelling, I would most definitely recommend this course to you. Professor Price is kind and very knowledgable, and you will learn how to write a great screenplay ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was a very fun course with a great professor. I learned a lot. It's quite different from my field of study and that made it all the more enjoyable to spend time discussing stories, reading stories, and seeing stories told (after all a film is a story). Don't take this course if you're want to do something super arsty and exploratory, but do take this course if you want to engage other people and tell a dramatic, funny, or powerful story that will keep someone riveted from beginning to end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I learned everything I know about screenwriting from this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are interested in screenwriting, or just love movies. You get to think about and start writing your own original feature and Brian has a lot of practical advice and experience. I really enjoyed this class, and found the seminars very engaging each week. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn about the structure of movies and is thinking about creating their own. ",
            "\u00a0Really fun opportunity to be creative, learn about screen playing, and get to learn from great movies past. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Brian Price is so dedicated and kind and really works with each student to develop good ideas. Great class community, too! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Whoever you are, take it. Lots of room for creativity and growth, but not too high in workload. Cannot say enough good things! ",
            "\u00a0I would! This is a great course if you're interested in learning about screenwriting, and also about creative fiction writing in general.  However it is definitely focused on the specific aspects of writing feature-length screenplays that sell, so if you're looking for a more general creative writing or scriptwriting class it might not be for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend the course to another student. It's very well planned and laid out, and left me with exactly the knowledge and skills I'd hoped for. The progression of the class is logical and well-paced. Your skills build and build along with your assignments until you are left with a fully structured screenplay with 15 pages written out. Prof. Price is a great teacher--smart, fun personable, experienced. And he gives great, clear, specific feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in going into the industry or just interested in writing for fun. Do be prepared to put some work in though, writing parts of a feature length film do take a few hours to get down on paper. The class is also more fun when you are interested in doing the work. "
