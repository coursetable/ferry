            "\u00a0I know this class was unusual in the sense that Edgar is teaching it while FES finds a new professor, and I respect his effort in overhauling it. But I still don't think it contains very useful information and certainly does not uphold FES's mission of preparing us to be practitioners. Learning energy conversions was useful but overall the class consists of looking at graphs at how the majority of the world uses fossil fuels, emissions are rising, and climate change is happening - basically all things you know before coming to FES. This may be a good class for someone who knows nothing about energy but is probably worth skipping. ",

Lectures were interesting, the technology brief was great, and I felt like Edgar was passionate about the class. On the less good side, it did feel like a ton of topics so taking away some of the key concepts was a little challenging by the end of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0They aligned pretty well. The course ended up feeling less intensive/time-consuming/difficult than I had anticipated (based on information from students in last year's course), likely because it was taught by an interim professor this year. ",
            "\u00a0Generally, they aligned quite well. I was surprised at how quickly the course diverged from strictly covering energy systems to low-carbon systems in relation to climate change, land use, etc. I don't think this was necessarily a bad thing, but I think a bit more focus on energy fundamentals would have been warranted, while zero-carbon/within 2-degrees energy (& economy & land) systems could have been a whole class unto itself. ",
            "\u00a0I had hoped that we would talk more about the quantitative (that is, engineering and economic) aspects of energy systems, but aside from a lot of unit conversions, we didn't really do much math. "

            "\u00a0Have a professor who cares, have TAs who care. Real, timely feedback, problems sets that are well written with clear expectations that don't use a confusing, non-intuitive template. \r\n\r\nReally it's unacceptable to have an energy foundations course so carelessly taught here given high student interest in energy and its importance in climate change policy. ",
            "\u00a0As mentioned above, I think finding a full time lecture (or Edgar continuing to do it) is vital. The course needs to be developed and needs sometime to be refined. The strengths are its a great topic, an important time for it, and very interesting. The materials themselves were alright and the course seemingly improved from last year, but just to address some of the disjointedness of the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the general format of the course was well thought out and enjoyed the student technical briefs during the second half of the semester. The one weakness that I thought the class had was in the formatting of the homework. While I thought the content on the homework was fine, I thought the way that the homework was formatted was confusing and did not help me reinforce the material that we had learned in class as well as it could have. I think it would have been much better if we had been able to use paper and pencil to submit our homework instead of using excel. I think it would have reinforced what calculations we were doing and when and would have been less time consuming than using the designed template. ",

            "\u00a0We went over some important concepts very quickly. I also wished we'd gone over exercises in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGreat curriculum for the subject.\r\nKnowledgeable professor and TAs.\r\nGrateful that the course was not overly US-centric - most of the energy-oriented courses I've shopped tend to have this issue. Professor made an effort to present examples that covered both US and non-US regions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe classroom: the ratio of size to student numbers. Avoid Burke if at all possible for a class size that could be accommodated in a smaller venue. Very easy to disengage in that type of environment. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the wide coverage of energy topics, guest lecturers, and insights in the areas of life cycle analysis and advances in energy technologies. The weaknesses include the lack of depth on certain topics because the topics were so varied and the problem sets relying upon skills not gained from the course itself. There were certain problem sets that relied upon information not found in the textbook, lectures, or outside reading. The course could be improved by establishing a clearer link between the reading and the lecture and problem sets. In addition, the tech briefs were a helpful exercise in presenting on the subject matter learned, but perhaps more problem sets in the second half of the class would have resulted in greater overall student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the portions of the course that focused on the application or implications of energy in systems.  For example, I really enjoyed the lectures that covered the lifecycle analysis of energy technologies, and compared them to one another based on the type of lifecycle methodology. I also enjoyed the discussion comparing/contrasting bioenergy carbon emissions from fossil-fuel carbon emissions. \r\n\r\nI struggled with portions of the class that dove deep into the weeds on technical engineering or scientific concepts. For example, the lecture on the Decarbonization Index was difficult for me to follow and understand. \r\n\r\nI thought some of the questions on problem sets, as well as the Midterm and Final exams, were not entirely well thought-out, causing confusion among students in how to best answer what was being asked.\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed working on the technology briefs in the second half of the semester, but felt the assignment could have provided a little more detail regarding the scope, depth, format, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I was very satisfied with this course! The course could have been improved by a bit more focus. I felt like the lectures included many diagrams with empirical results, such as various types of Sankey diagrams, but the key takeaways from such figures were not always clear. Particularly in the second half of the semester, the consensus of the class seemed to be that students did not know what concepts to study for the final. Especially troubling to me were final study questions that included facts like typical efficiencies of different steps of the energy system or emissions per vehicle-km of different elements of the life cycle, which focused much more on facts than on concepts. Given that these types of questions are 1) statistics that can be looked up and 2) empirically developed, probably sensitive to methodology, and likely constantly in flux, I would have liked more focus on how to analyze, interpret, and make decisions using such statistics rather than on regurgitating the numbers. ",
            "\u00a0Since the grading seemed a bit subjective, it would be nice to receive clearer feedback on assignments--I often felt that I thoroughly understood the material but this was not reflected in my grade. I also didn't find the technology briefs particularly helpful but am not sure how to improve them other than perhaps eliminating entirely. "
