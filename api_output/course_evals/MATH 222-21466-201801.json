The course itself was not that difficult, although exams and some pset problems pushed us to think more critically to understand some proofs and more abstracts concepts behind the basic linear algebra and were at times challenging. I learned to think more critically and was impressed by the wide range of applications of linear algebra. I enjoyed the second half of the semester where we looked at more applications of linear algebra from looking at basic models including population growth, differential equations, or predicting the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence to learning the math behind fitting the best regression line (useful in statistics and data analysis) to learning about singular value decomposition which is used in graphics and other areas.

Additionally, while Jinwei's teaching started very solid, he got noticeably tired and less-enthused with time, leading to poorer explanations and more convoluted understandings of higher-level concepts.

",

The difficulty of the course was good; easier than multivariable calculus, but still quite challenging. ",

I do not know if the administration will read this response, but I highly highly highly suggest that the University retain Professor Yang, if only because of his outstanding value as a lecturer (it is my understanding that he does not currently have a contract for next year).\r\n\r\nAs someone who previously took this course at Georgia Tech, Professor Yang's explanations were truly very clear and very succinct (a million times better than Georgia Tech's class). Furthermore, all the exam material was extremely fair. A think a hallmark of this class is that every class period (1 hour 15 minutes), felt extremely short every single time I came to lecture, because Professor Yang's presentation of the material was so easy to understand, but also interesting and engaging. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that some students will say that his lectures were not clear or hard to understand or something, but frankly that is because those students are not putting enough effort in the class into understanding the material he is talking about. They might counter by saying they spent so and so hours trying to understand what is going on, but I can guarantee you that they did not do enough (i.e. do more practice problems, go to peer tutor hours, go to section, go to office hours). Furthermore, the average homework grade is very high in this class, so to say that Professor Yang is not a good lecturer (but somehow you still get high homework grades) to me implies that these students either did not actually do the homework or that they are contradicting themselves.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that the scope of the material covered is probably too low. Considering that this course is called Linear Algebra with Applications, I think more time should be spent on real applications such as Google Page Rank, stochastic matrices, etc. ",

In the classroom, linear algebra is different from calculus in that a conversation about linear may sound something like: \"Only if the matrix is nonsingular will it's rank be n. It will therefore be invertible making it possible to diagonalize it.(Note quite true)\" If you don't know the definition of one of these terms or aren't able to make immediate connections between them, then the whole statement is total gibberish. This is to me what class felt like. In Calc, if you're lagging behind in class you can at least look at an integral and see what it represents, whereas here you are basically doomed to copy down nonsensical sentences into your notes for later review. I think that the teacher could recognize this and do a better job of communicating key ideas. The book is horrible and the homework is long and tedious. The average on the midterm was curved to a B- and the final was incredibly hard. ",

In terms of weaknesses, there were wild jumps in the duration of each pset, and the instructor was unable to communicate with great clarity. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is decent and the course goes through most of the basics of linear algebra. I would say, however, that the lack of theory/developing an understanding of what things, such as a determinant, are, was frustrating, especially when the exams would have conceptual questions such as proofs. ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty good. I think people who complain are the same people who copy problems off Slader and fail the tests. Jinwei has a good sense of humor about the hard stuff and if you go to class, you will remember things at opportune times (ie, the exams!) 50% for the final was admittedly kind of rough but i understand.

            "\u00a0The only strength of this class is that it isn't that much work; I felt as though the material was poorly paced (half a semester on Gaussian elimination, half a semester on everything else), the lectures were uninteresting, the PSETs were not fairly graded (only ~5 out of 20 problems were graded each time) and the exams were much harder than the entirely computation-based problems on PSETs and in class. Could be improved by actually teaching things about matrix theory at least a little bit rather than doing number crunching examples for half of each lecture, spacing out the difficult material, and having better lectures.

The course is abstract and the teacher didn't make any effort to help students get anything out of it. ",

            "\u00a0It's the easier linear algebra course. Take it if you want a non-proof-based, ok linear algebra class. The textbook is terrible, and the homework comes from it, but many similar questions and explanations can be found online so that can help you understand. The grading is very final exam-heavy, about 50% of your grade, which is frustrating because homeworks can take a lot of time and they're not worth much. ",
            "\u00a0No, take math 225 if you want to understand anything about matrices and/or not want to fall asleep every single lecture. You learn very little in this class despite the normal workload; please just do yourself a favor and put in the extra 5 hr/week and take 225. This class was boring, poorly planned, graded and tested, and not at all enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course with fast pace and condensed materials. The learning and teaching style is a lot similar to MATH 120. Working load was heavy in the first  half of the semester because the pset usually takes 8 hours a week; the workload becomes manageable later. It will be fine if you do your pset and you will learn very well. ",
            "\u00a0No, take 225 if you really want to understand linear algebra. You'll have to put in more time and effort, but it'll be much more rewarding and useful than skating by in 222. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a STEM (except pre-med) major, you probably need to take this course to fulfill the requirements. Otherwise, you won't learn anything from a large lecture and a cynical teacher. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0The teaching quality for this class is very spotty because it changes every semester. I found lectures hard to understand and largely relied on the textbook. The psets this semester were also sometimes a little ridiculous in length (30+ questions). "
