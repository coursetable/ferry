            "\u00a0Field interviewing, engaging with a variety of scholarship and journalistic texts ",
            "\u00a0How to write a qualitative paper. Learning to question the systems in place intended to better our students but doing far from that ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into resource hoarding, tracking, private schools, school segregation and an host of other issues. This class expanded my horizon of educational issues and it was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Coming into this with limited exposure to both education studies and sociology more generally, I felt that I learned a massive amount in this course. For one, it completely overturned my understanding of the relationship between schools and their geography, especially as it relates to the history of housing segregation in the United States. Once we transitioned from the historical aspects to the modern day, we learned about different approaches to school choice, their respective pros and cons, etc. Through the Hamden case study, I also learned practical social science skills like interviewing, writing field notes, and coding information. Perhaps my biggest insight was the connection between debates on the achievement gap and the effects of poverty in schools with other debates regarding things like the racial or socioeconomic balance of a school. Before this class, I was convinced that simply pouring resources into underperforming schools and their families would be enough, but this class effectively makes a case for why integration is important. ",
            "\u00a0I gained further insight into the inner workings of school choice within both urban and suburban settings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible! I had never taken an EDST course before, and this was a great class for someone who didn't have experience in the department but was also an upperclassman not too interested in taking an intro-level course. I really appreciated this class just because of the relevance of the topic -- this is something every Yale student should spend time thinking about, because it effects all of us. Especially for people with privileged educational backgrounds, it is important to think critically about all the structural processes that enabled that and the narratives of meritocracy and deservingness that we are fed at Yale. In this course, students got to practice doing reflective analysis, which I think is SO important and doesn't happen enough at Yale, by writing papers about our own educations and hometowns. We also had specific time during class to share about our backgrounds and identities, which of course influence the way we approach every topic, not just Ed studies. \r\n\r\nGetting to do the Hamden case study was great, as I think it gave students a chance to do some real research (and centered around our own area - which is unfortunately rare in Yale classes!) and get out into parts of the New Haven area most students will never visit. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, we not only learned about education reform efforts but also were constantly discussing the implications of both historically rooted institutional inequities and currently held implicit (and explicit) racial and ethnic biases that lead to further inequalities. I loved how this semester was a mix of journal articles and research as well as case studies into specific cities (including Hamden, CT). Through these case studies we were able to see the phenomena we were learning about in action. ",

            "\u00a0Great classroom climate and engaging assignments. Conversations sometimes veered so far into personal stories and experiences that it became somewhat ungrounded in level-headed academics, but that may be deliberate. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mira Debs is a great professor and everyone should take a class with her. Nonetheless, what made this the best class I've ever taken was the people. The diversity in the seminar led to thought provoking and engaging discussions. I was worried that the 2 hr seminar would drag on, but the opposite occurred--I wanted class to keep going! This class is a must take! Interesting assignments, content, professor, and people.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Since the class only meant once a week, it was hard for us to fit in all the content that Professor Debs wanted. We did not get to discuss everything. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is certainly the material covered, the guest speakers, and the range of assignments! Because you also dive into the history of housing development and segregation in the U.S., you get a rich picture for the educational landscape post-Brown and how it came to be. The guest speakers were awesome and provided so much perspective on our weekly readings. I would only suggest spacing out seminars between speakers, because it did feel as though speaker days usually meant we didn't get to discuss readings for the day that were not related to the speakers. That said, it was incredible to see what people had to say about modern day education issues. I was especially inspired by the last speakers, IntegrateNYC, which showed the power of grassroots, youth-led movements. Lastly, every assignment is different, which makes it a really fun course. From the biographical essay to the interview analysis to the final paper, there is a lot of freedom in the course to practice different methods of writing and learning that most seminars simply don't offer.\r\n\r\nThe only major thing I suggest improvement on was better use of classroom discussion. While there were weekly reading responses, they weren't always mentioned in class, making them feel like they were only a tool for reading accountability as opposed to actual starting points for discussion. More importantly, though, I think having weekly discussions questions that students should think about as they do the readings would greatly boost discussion and make class time more productive. Having discussion questions would allow everyone to come in with something to say about at least one of the readings, ensuring more participation from everyone and more meaningful engagement between classmates. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! I loved the syllabus, particularly the ways it incorporated academic essays with popular sources like news articles and podcasts. It's a great class for sophomores and juniors too, because Professor Debs makes a point of teaching us how to really critique scholarship and simulate peer feedback by bringing authors to class and having us discuss their scholarship (strengths, limitations, further questions, etc). Overall, I would have liked more time to just talk about ourselves and the expertise we all have just by virtue of growing up in education systems. I love courses that centralize lived experience as a form of knowing, and this class did that -- it just could have been emphasized slightly more! ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent because much of the conversation was rooted in personal experiences and anecdotal evidence. I think it would have been interesting to have spent even more time reading things like each other's personal educational experience papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is very involved and jumps immediately to big questions. All of the readings are super interesting and the course builds off of itself and gets us to challenge assumptions. The assignments are also really interesting and hands-on. Good reflection on personal experiences\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the syllabus is pretty ambitious in terms of what it wants to cover. Would like more time to spend on reflecting and bigger questions, as well as different activities in class to approach questions from different angles instead of just summarizing readings, and work more with other people "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was very accessible to non-education studies majors. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must take. It is by far one of the best classes I've taken. Not only is the knowledge necessary to be an informed thoughtful person, it really gives you insight into a diversity of educational issues that forces you to reflect on your own education. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course, especially to anyone interested in any issues related to educational inequity. This is a must-take for anyone in the ed studies program or anyone who wishes to be involved in the improvement of public education. Professor Debs really did a great job of selecting the readings and guest speakers for this course as well as making class assignments meaningful. This course is also very accessible to someone with minimal exposure to sociology and non-majors, so I encourage anyone who is even remotely interested to shop it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student invested in learning more about education in general. The course built off of EDST 110 in some ways but provided the proper background for students who did not that the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! I would recommend this class to everyone who cares about equity and, if more justification is needed, to anyone interested in more deeply understanding how their educational experiences have been shaped by systemic processes, power, identity, housing, etc. This class also deals with race, class, and segregation (even though it looks on the surface like an education policy class) and we spent quite a few weeks just delving into the topic of segregation and systemic inequality. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who has a passion for social policy work. It will both sadden you about the current state of our world and also inspire you to go out and try to change the inequities in place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in issues of race and equity in schooling! Lots of interesting philosophical/policy questions. "
