            "\u00a0This course allowed me to refine my understanding of the history of technology as its own distinct discipline and trace the traditions and methodology of the field in a structured manner, while also learning how to use them for my own work. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided background and analytical tools to evaluate various approaches to the history of technology based upon a wide variety of criteria, most particularly regarding the intentions of the historian and the methods for engaging with archives. This helped to develop skills in close reading to determine how a particular agenda, historiography, or methodology impacts the telling of a history, and further gave me insights into effective ways to write histories that engaged complex concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful in that it provided me with a comprehensive overview of the major topics in the history of technology. I was able to learn about discussions, both past and present, that have been the focus of historians working on technology in the 20th and 21st centuries. Weekly reflections allowed me to organize my thoughts on the readings and attendance at a conference provided me with some themes and ideas that will prove useful for my own research. ",
            "\u00a0I developed significant insights into the varied approaches to the history of technology. Not having taken such a course before, I found the material consistently challenging. I believe this course has enabled me to reflect on how I may incorporate the approaches to the study of technology into my future work. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was well organized and the discussion format lent itself to students developing their own ways of addressing course topics which they could then share with others in a process of mutual discovery. Where the course could be improved is in the connecting of thematics from week to week. While this is something that was implicit, making topical connections more explicit might help build a more cohesive picture of how and why particular approaches to the history of technology developed. ",
            "\u00a0Submitting weekly reading responses was really helpful because it allowed me to unpack the readings, organize my thoughts on them, and receive comments and points for further thought from Professor Bertucci. ",
            "\u00a0The course material could reflect a wider geographical scope. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think the course offered a broad base of knowledge and approaches that would be valuable for almost any discipline. It posed important questions while also leaving room for student exploration of how to situate these approaches relative to their own research interests. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course was challenging and enjoyable. I believe this course has better prepared me to produce more engaging scholarship in my own field. "
