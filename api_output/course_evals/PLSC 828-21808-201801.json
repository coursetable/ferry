            "\u00a0I learned lots about how scholars of American political development have thought about parties, macro-level issues, etc. There was a particularly nice emphasis on the intersection of theory and evidence, which was refreshing given the extensive exposure to methods courses recently. I also learned lots about how APD scholars' insights can inform research in comparative politics - and vice versa. The professor had a great way of getting us to think about big picture issues. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to think about American Politics developmentally. It forced me to ask different questions about American Politcs. Not simply \"who governs\" but a discussion about how different institutions affected how government works. ",
            "\u00a0This class exposed me to the theoretical, methodological, and substantive underpinnings of American Political Development.   I walked away with a greater understanding of this subfield and a deeper appreciation for it and its service to the study of American politics.  Being able to critically investigate the developmental underpinnings of American political institutions, behavior, and broader contemporary debates is an invaluable component of political science. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nThe professor was accessible and provided great feedback on the final research paper. The course readings were quite diverse in their substantive focus, and it was nice that the reading list followed a clear arc throughout the semester. The engagement with history was particularly refreshing. The professor's 5-10 minute in-class introduction to each reading was excellent for contextualizing and synthesizing the insights.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to have students submit a series of discussion questions, from which the prof. selects a few to discuss in class. This could help fill some of the awkward silences in class. ",
            "\u00a0Its a very one sided course, focusing on only the topics Prof Skowronek finds interesting or important. He essentially built the field of APD from the ground up with Prof Orren (UCLA), but if youre looking for a balanced survey course that includes substantial discussions of anything but progressivism, youll be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the array of course readings that offered a comprehensive reading of the field of APD.\r\n\r\nI found the response paper assignment very difficult and poorly defined. The syllabus did not necessarily discuss what a successful paper should discuss. Terming the assignment a \"response paper\" has a clear indication for the content and engagement with the course readings. If this was not the intent of the assignment than more clear guidance should have been given in the syllabus. I did not have a clear understanding of what was expected of me in any of the three assignments despite engagement with the instructor and syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Skowronek had very compelling and clear lectures at the beginning of every class that provided an important foundation by which we would discuss the material later.  While at times, I do wish more students participated (perhaps cold-calling on some students in the future), I did appreciate the discussions that took place each week. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend it for students of comparative politics, especially. They can learn a great deal about state building, institutions, etc. from a perspective previously not encountered. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students I knew were pursuing graduate research in the institutions of AP. More than likely, I would not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any students interested in American politics -- be that from a theoretical or empirical (quantitative or qualitative) perspective.   As I said previously, being able to critically investigate the developmental underpinnings of American political institutions, behavior, and broader contemporary debates is an invaluable component of political science.
