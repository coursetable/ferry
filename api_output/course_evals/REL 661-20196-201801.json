            "\u00a0Austin (Charles) was the second teaching fellow for this class, more for additional commentary and specialized foci and conversing with the needs of students.  As far as I know, no one was personally assigned him as a TF.  Knowing him beforehand, the students who sought help from him if needed would have been in good hands if unable to meet with Dr. Beeley. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't have a separate section with either TF, so I don't have any substantial feedback to provide. That being said, I did find Charles to be really helpful in clarifying some of the context of the early Christian church that I definitely didn't know. He always had helpful commentary to add to Prof. Beeley's lectures. ",
            "\u00a0WOW so amazing! Such a good listener during the seminar, and all comments- either context points or theological angles- were illuminating and well-directed. Conversations outside class were incredibly helpful and warm-- so knowledgeable and generous with time and attention. Can't praise highly enough! ",
            "\u00a0I was a sometime Latin section attendee, and I thought Austin did a great job. He also had great things to say in class, things Beeley didn't know. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: knowledge in various topics, easy availability for academic discussion ",
            "\u00a0Austin (Charles) frequently offers useful comments in our discussion to help clarify critical points. He also makes himself available to students to discuss questions concerning course readings and papers. ",
            "\u00a0We had little interaction with the teaching fellows, aside from their occasional comments in class and one day when they led the class. Austin's training as a pastor comes through when he enters into discussion. He is excellent at synthesizing discussion points and then adding in new insight. In his brief interjections, he was usually able to include incredible tidbits of information that took the subject deeper. ",
            "\u00a0Austin was brilliant in class discussion and extremely helpful when I approached him with questions. I had a time conflict, but I wish I could have come to his Latin section! ",
            "\u00a0Charles Rivera is an awesome instructor and is so qualified as a teacher. He makes things so simple and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Ross was a teaching fellow for this class, more for additional commentary and specialized expertise foci and conversing with the needs of students.  No one was personally assigned to him as far as I know.  Knowing him, however, the students were in good hands if unable to meet with Dr. Beeley during his open office hours or moments after class. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't have a separate section with either TF, so I don't have any substantial feedback to provide; however, I always found Ross's comments in class in addition to Prof. Beeley's helpful. ",
            "\u00a0He was very helpful in discussing papers. He contributed to the class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0We had little interaction with the teaching fellows, aside from their occasional comments in class and one day when they led the class. Ross seems to have read everything. He always has an interesting tidbit to add to difficult discussion, and is great at helping to clarify confusing points. ",
            "\u00a0Ross was extremely helpful during class and section discussion and in answering questions. He thoroughly knows the material. "
