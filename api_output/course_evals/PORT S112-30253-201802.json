            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of basic Portuguese grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some elementary level Portuguese effectively and was able to utilize it in conversation. Learning Portuguese was made easier by the fact that I was able to practice it every day. ",

            "\u00a0We were immersed in the culture and had to use Portuguese with our families so it was a way to learn it quickly. Prof Bete always made class engaging and exciting. While it is an eight week long program, there is a lot to learn in a short period. ",

I also believe taking language classes over the summer is a lot more enjoyable and easy to manage than during the school of the year. ",
