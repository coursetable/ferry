            "\u00a0I developed a thorough understanding of how chemical engineers understand industrial processes and learned how to control said processes to keep them stable. This course is invaluable for those looking to work in industry as process engineers. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to design and create process control models using a variety of techniques.  I learned how to think about a controlled system as a series of interactions, and to link those interactions together to control certain outputs using data from inputs.  I learned how to assess controlled system stability using a number of techniques.  I also learned how to represent systems and control schemes using real-world engineering software such as Matlab. Overall, this course taught me how to choose control mechanisms for chemical systems, and gave me insight into troubleshooting/assessing these mechanisms. "

            "\u00a0With Professor Loewenberg, this course is fantastic. The material is thorough, the lectures are clear, and the workload is manageable and didactic. There are no weaknesses in this course when taught by him. ",
            "\u00a0The class is definitely good in providing notes and office hours for the problem sets. My one issue is that a lot of what we explain in class has practical applications, but we stayed heavily on the theoretical side of things. I think it would have been really helpful to get real life examples and applications of the problems we did in class to really tether the students onto something tangible when thinking about the systems of interest. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very comprehensive and builds on itself in satisfying and logical ways.  The significance of course material (such as transfer functions, block diagrams, and process modeling software) reaches far past the boundaries of this course and process control alone. I felt that the pace of this course was fair, and that the amount of material covered was impressive. The only potential weakness of this course was that sometimes the process control concepts were muddled and lost in the large amount of algebra required to find solutions. "

            "\u00a0I recommend it to all chemical engineering students - students from other majors may find the course too challenging as it relies on fundamental knowledge from previous engineering courses. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this class, you are ABET chemE. You're in this deep so go with the flow and try to get the most out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course. It teaches valuable concepts and perspectives for ALL engineers.  It involves fun problem solving and troubleshooting, and you even get to learn how to model processes using Matlab software! Note that a large part of why I had such a great experience in this course was the instructor. Professor Loewenberg was a communicative and supportive teacher, and cared about each individual student's success with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Take with Loewenberg if you can. Good stuff "
