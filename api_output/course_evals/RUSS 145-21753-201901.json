            "\u00a0I learned Russian! Not only that, I learned so much about the culture and history of the country and how both inform the language itself. It's both a very practical language class and a fascinating opportunity to be exposed to a very different culture and way of thinking. \r\n\r\nI'm so grateful to Constantine and Valeria for their ability to accelerate my learning and my classmates' learning and teach us so much in a short time period. ",
            "\u00a0An immense amount of knowledge about the Russian language and culture ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent way to learn about the Russian language and culture at a fast pace with amazing faculty! ",
            "\u00a0I developed critical foundational skills in the Russian language which i am confident will serve me well as i continue to build my proficiency in the language ",
            "\u00a0I continued learning Russian from last semester, when I took the intensive introductory course. This semester had a lot more vocabulary and continued some of the grammar from first semester. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my conversation, reading, writing, and comprehension skills in Russian to the point where I can comprehend short stories, carry on a conversation, and write multiple paragraphs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the Russian Language!  In addition to speaking and writing, I practiced my skills in circumlocution. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I actually began to understand Russian at a conversational level. Being in class every day and having great feedback on homework and tests made this an immersive experience that has granted me the ability to use the language. I was surprised when the other day I was able to fully understand the content of a speech made by a Russian veteran at a World War II victory celebration. Through this class I learned the hard aspects of the Russian language, but I now feel prepared to take my study to an advanced level. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop a working knowledge of Russian, and gave me all the building blocks and tools necessary to achieve true proficiency in future study. It taught me how to effectively learn languages, how to manage the workload of an intensive language program, and how to focus my efforts efficiently to achieve the best grasp of the material. I feel it has prepared me extremely well for the intensive Russian study abroad program I am going on this summer. "

            "\u00a0This course is very intense and consumed much of my time this semester and year. That being said, it is \"Intensive Russian\" and should be that level of intensity. It is the best way to learn the language. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course ",
            "\u00a0It was taught very quickly which is the nature of an intensive language, I wouldnt change anything about the course since it was engaging and helped students learn both the written and spoken language ",
            "\u00a0Constantine and Valeriia are incredible at teaching russian in a way that can be internalized quickly. They were able to teach us concepts that typically take years to learn, in just a few months. I dont have any complaints about this class except that the final had a few terms we hadnt covered ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course and it is very well taught. The only downside is the amount it meets can limit what other classes you can take, but that should be expected with an intensive language class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - amazing professor and TA, very engaging and informative\r\nWeaknesses - none, really ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect.  I love everything about it.  Professor created a perfect environment that was encouraging for students to be engaged and excited about learning the language.  The homework is actually very helpful.  The syntax is very well explained. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in the openness of the instructors and their genuine desire to teach the language. Never in a language class have I seen such enjoyment from teaching the basic elements of a language. This energy permeates the classroom even on early mornings where everyone is drowsy and makes the environment such that one is incentivized to learn if only because it seems so exciting. Another strength of this class is the time we spend in it. I appreciate the concentration of Russian language study in this course and I would not have it any other way. Intensive is the best way to learn. The weakness of this class lies in the fact that it only is in the mornings. While homework helps reinforce grammar and vocabulary knowledge, it is easy to zone out and drag on through the workbook. To supplement this, I think the class would do well to have more video assignments and to have most of the class be conducted in Russian towards the end. It may be difficult, but I think by that point the class can handle that level of exposure. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main strengths was the high caliber of the teaching in this course. Another was the hours structure, having daily class but alternating two hour and one hour class sessions in order to ease off a bit in between the long days. Also, the videos and plot used as teaching tools were extremely engaging and amusing, not to mention helpful in developing oral and listening skills. Having a test every Monday was a lot, but also reduced the stress involved, since they became routine, and didn't feel like midterms or something to stress overly about. The only major weakness in this course was that due to the expedited curriculum, there was a tremendous amount of homework to be done, hours every day, which quickly accumulated and was difficult to catch up on.

            "\u00a0If you would like to learn Russian and have the time to devote significant effort to doing so, this is absolutely the best class for you. The quality of teaching is excellent, the pace is intense, and you will learn a lot of Russian very quickly! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, if they want to learn Russian quickly this is definitely the best way to do it ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It is amazing how much russian they were able to teach us in such a short period of time. Constantine is amazing at teaching us the linguistics/etymology behind pieces of the language so that we internalize their meaning, not just memorize the word. Valeriia is very patient when teaching difficult concepts and a joy to be a student under. The intensive series is much better than the regular course, it is a more immersive experience and I am better for it in my language skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course, especially if you took the intensive intro class. It really is the best way to learn a language and Professor Muravnik is a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student.  Anybody who takes this course will see a great improvement in Russian language skills, and the grade you receive is generally fair given what you put into the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn another language and, in fact, have already recommended to several of my peers seeking a language credit to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is not overwhelming, but certainly feels satisfying if you put in the work to learn (which is mainly just paying attention). I think this course lends itself primarily for those who have an ear for language in the first place because it is so fast paced, but that is exactly why it is rewarding. It is not a large workload burden and it still feels quite satisfying. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a lot of time and a lot of work, but I really feel that it was worth it. This class and the intensive track are a remarkable opportunity to get a jump start on Russian, and to effectively learn a lot of the language in a short period of time. I'm excited by the idea that thanks to this track, I will go from knowing no Russian at the beginning of freshman year to being eligible for level 5 courses at the beginning of my sophomore year. "
