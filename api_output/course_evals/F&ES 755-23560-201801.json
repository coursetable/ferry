So, that was a shock to me and was not expected. Because of that, the skills I gained were both, what I wanted, but also what I didn't expect to learn. \r\n\r\nThe real gain here was the insights. Within the first month, I realized that I was ill well prepared for this course. In hindsight, I would have benefited immensely from an introductory seminar, as GIS was not at all what I had expected to be.

Having little to no exposure to this type of analysis, I basically did not really understand what this course and the questions it asked would entail. But within a few weeks I was definitely getting into learning the underlying reasoning for different functions and understanding how to justify using them to achieve different outcomes. In this way, my learning far surpassed my expectations, and I feel well prepared to address at least basic-to-moderate geospatial questions - or at the very least to understand how to start thinking about them.

I learned a lot in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I know this class is focused on rasters, but I think spending one or two classes on the basics of vector would not be out of place, even if it is just about how to turn vector data into raster. Also I don't have a good sense of where this raster data comes from. Maybe some homework assignments that use publicly available data would be interesting. ",

Weaknesses - too much effort on the presentation of the PDF homework assignments; it would have been helpful to receive more specific feedback on grades, it was not always clear to me why I received the grade I did; it would have been more meaningful for the homework assignments to have been realistic topics that might apply to future work versus entertaining/niche asks - it was much easier to justify allocating time to the assignment where we chose our own land use.

            "\u00a0This course does a really good job at getting you to think about spatial mapping problems in a clear and logical way. The skills go beyond operating software into complex problem solving. In my opinion, it could be improved by spending less time with Model Builder at the end of the semester, and continuing with the types of problem sets that were so great at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class makes sure that you understand what you are doing instead of just telling you where in arcmap you should click on. ",
            "\u00a0Great practical exposure to topics. Was unfortunate the lecture was given in lecture hall instead of computer lab. is really hard to learn and follow along with computer programming stuff without doing it. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the strengths of this course are, Dana, and his ability to relate information to the class. He made the most enigmatic of topics, palatable, exciting, understandable. Secondly, the information gained was very useful. \r\n\r\nI believe that the weaknesses of the course are Dana's very high expectations, short assignment turn around time, and a somewhat inequitable grading regime. I thought it was unfair to have equal expectations across a class of 50 when knowledge ranged from ultra beginner all the way to proficient. Some students were quite experienced in GIS to start. Overall, the classes strengths seemed to vary regarding the mathematics required to process the software. It seemed as though assignments were graded by making the very best assignment each week, the highest score, then grades were delivered backward from it. This means that those that are exceptional set the bar, and those who are doing well for their level of proficiency are not being graded equitably. Lastly, the class had a lot of homework that required about 20-30 hours a week. I was not prepared to fulfill this time allotment.  Had I known I would not have taken the class. The first two weeks and assignments took minutes. While assignments later on in the class took up to 30+ hours. I think a major weakness of the class is that it's set up in a way the necessitates that amount of time, and some just don't have the time to give to it. This results in assignments being incomplete, or poor in performance. Not only that, we didn't even have a week to do the work as assignments were issued on Tuesday at 4:00 pm and due Monday at noon. \r\n\r\nI believe this course could it be improved by classifying students into proficiency levels and then diversifying assignments to match the levels. For instance, if there was an assignment that had 5 steps to reach the desired result, those that are very new to the software could strive to achieve level 5, but will more than likely achieve 2 or 3. This way here, they are able to turn in a completed assignment, that they are able to gain skills from and on time. Then as they get better, there can be incentives to strive towards steps 4 and 5. This would make equitable grading easier too. For instance, you could write that you were striving to get to step 3, and your write up would walk Dana through how you got to step 3. Then, your grades would be compared to 3s and not 5s. ",
            "\u00a0Great course.  Maybe only suggestion would be to continually infuse the class with \"real-world\" examples of when raster GIS comes in handy (like were mentioned over a handful of times, but the more the better!). ",
            "\u00a0The skills covered in the course were well explained and were very useful. ",
            "\u00a0A great course for challenging our understanding and creativity in the use of geospatial tools for problem revelation and solving. ",
            "\u00a0Strength\r\n- Very useful skills gained\r\n- Weekly assignments do a great job of developing valuable GIS skills ",
            "\u00a0Dana explains the program well and his in-class demonstrations of how different tools within raster function are very helpful.  He was also very understanding if students needed extensions to complete homework assignments and was also happy to lend insight into GIS assignments for another class I was taking.\r\n\r\nIt could be tough to know what Dana was looking for in the homework assignments.  Some weeks I put it a lot of extra effort but only did moderately well on the assignment and some weeks I did very well without feeling like I'd put nearly as much time into it.  Honestly, I still don't know what caused the difference because I don't think it was skill level. ",
            "\u00a0This class was accessible and could be as easy or hard as a student was willing to make it. By identifying the more experienced students at the beginning of the semester and delegating some responsibility to them, it made the content more accessible to the beginners and made the challenge of providing explanations into a lesson for the pros. \r\n\r\nAn improvement that I might recommend is to make the assignments align with the creation of a portfolio that can be used to present to a prospective employer or to use the collective efforts of the students to come up with unique solutions for a region that could benefit from an outside perspective. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved with additional TA's and additional offered hours. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching of the tools was very effective and I thought the assignments did a good job of reinforcing many of the important tools. However, I would have liked more of the assignments to be specific to the issues we are interested in at FES - it would be nice if students could tailor some of them to personal interests. Additionally, while it was nice in the moment, I would have liked to learn some more tools in the second half of the semester when class was often cut short or not held at all. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that we very rapidly learned a lot from the program, the limitations and applications to environmental management.\r\nThe weaknesses include that most of the assignments were really difficult not because of GIS skills but of required creative thinking that I didn't know that class would cover. It ended up taking a lot more of my time. ",
            "\u00a0It's just a lot of work.  It's good ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Probably needed another TF. Piazza was good, but one-on-one help with a GIS pro is always better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton from this course, but mostly from the out of class exercises, which were often long and tortuous. The in-class sessions were informative but very idiosyncratic. Lectures were rambly and had a high ratio of words: content. (Dana often says the same things multiple ways to make sure everyone gets it, which might be useful but also makes it hard to focus as he's entering his 5th description of the same thing.) \r\n\r\nThe grading system was pretty opaque, despite visible efforts otherwise. All assignments are sorted into \"buckets\" based on specific scores. While you find out which bucket you ended up in, you don't find out exactly what put you there. (Did I execute the task correctly, but lose points for presentation? Did I make up for sloppy GIS work with strong presentation skills? What did I do wrong?) There is no specific feedback unless you go out of your way to ask for it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent introduction to concepts of raster based mapping, not just an introduction to software.  Condensed teaching format (i.e. 1 lecture per week).  Emphasis on self directed learning, with plenty of support provided.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have liked an introduction to python programming in ArcGIS.  Could have looked at some other types of GIS software other than Arc (i.e. R, QGIS, GRASS etc.) ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that Professor Dana Tomlin has such a profound understanding of how to solve geospatial problems, the history of the geospatial processing field, and the history and current status of ArcGIS software and other geospatial processing tools. He explains concepts in meaningful and tangible ways, and he puts a lot of time into helping students.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this course was that it was taught with much broader strokes than the vector GIS course in the fall. I felt that the students who came into the course with no GIS experience were at a disadvantage, so I felt that instead of letting students out of class early on many sessions, we could have spent more time on these concepts and moved through the material slower with each individual class period. ",
            "\u00a0Very little background info/foundational information about GIS, but that's apparently covered well in the vector class, Modeling Geographic Objects. ",
            "\u00a0Dana has the ability to explain the same concept in several ways so that they can be understood by several people. \r\n\r\nThe class this semester was very large and it was difficult to understand him at times. Because the class is so long, it can often be difficult to remember all the concepts that Dana talks about. The class might benefit from being a flipped course so that students can revisit concepts again and again. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be better in a computer lab so everyone can follow along ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that you really become familiar with the software, and solve some interesting problems. The weakness is that it is taught as a lecture class, when so much learning happens interfacing with the program. It's too bad that the class isn't taught in a flipped-style, or somehow have a lab component to trouble-shoot issues as a class with the professor there to help. My other big recommendation is that we learn how to import data from the internet. Datasets were always given, but it seems like a major challenge in the real world will be locating, downloading, and manipulating one or multiple sources of raster data. This class did not teach us how to do that. My other big suggestion is that it would be great if someone--Tomlin, TAs, etc could provide individualized feedback on each assignment. Often it wasn't clear what you did wrong, and although he provides a grading rubric, it still wasn't clear what each individual assignment went astray. I felt not having this feedback, even if it was a two-sentence comment on what was wrong, negatively impacted my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated Professor Tomlin's teaching style and the way he uses examples in the classroom to help us understand functions of a computer program. The fact that we don't even really need computers in class to learn about the concepts underlying geospatial software is a testament to the conceptual way that the class is thought. And while some may view this as not as useful as walking through the functions or a number of examples within the software, I found this conceptual understanding more useful for thinking through how to address the weekly assignment.\r\n\r\nOf course, this class is very time consuming and takes a significant amount of input even just to get something turned in, and this definitely dissuades students from joining. I think a similar level of understanding could be gained through the weekly assignments even if there were a few less steps/even if there was a bit more guidance about how to start, as figuring out how to get started often takes the most time. Another significant time sink that I think could be addressed is the presentation of each assignment. It would sometimes take me hours more to put together the pdf for submission even after creating my final map. While I understand the need to learn how to present ideas and process in an understandable way, I felt undue pressure to create \"pretty\" submissions which I don't think should play such a large role in the course. If the main idea of the submissions is to understand what we did and why, I think having a basic outline that we fill out with the functions used and a justification would be sufficient to assess our process and understanding. And then perhaps just a few assignments could have that extra emphasis on presentation. I think this could take a lot of stress out of the class and decrease the amount of time spent without changing the level of understanding and learning achieved. Additionally, a method of evaluation that gives a better idea of what we are aiming for each week - and that doesn't just rank us against each other - I think would also be useful and would decrease the level of stress associated with this course. As it stands, it sometimes feels like we are having to guess what the instructor would want to see with each assignment, without much guidance. "

            "\u00a0don't set your expectations too high for mastering GIS, but if your objective is to break the ice for what GIS is all about, this is a solid way to do so. You'll spend a lot of time on homework, but is there really any other way to learn a software than by engaging with it? ",
            "\u00a0Great class for GIS. Take it if you want to do GIS in your career--don't take it if you are just falling in the trap of thinking everyone needs GIS skills. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure that you have enough time to allocate to this course, as the workload is significant. ",
            "\u00a0Start the homework early and stay with it. Use the tutorials. ",
            "\u00a0Take it when you have time. Getting behind will make this course a miserable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take more than 12 credits or 4 classes. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure to block out at least 10-16 hours a week to be in the computer lab working on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0take it with remote sensing. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you have a good chunk of time to do the homework, it will be every week and basically use all your free time and energy ~10-20 hrs. ",
            "\u00a0I would advise them to be prepared for heavy stress and to not take it unless they were proficient in statistics and able to commit about 20-30 hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0You get what you give! ",
            "\u00a0The workload of this course is very high compared to many other F&ES courses. ",
            "\u00a0A must for students who are pursuing any type of geospatial (or even quantitative) data track. Very involved and demanding, but overall a great course for challenging your understanding and creativity in the use of geospatial tools for problem revelation and solving. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely amazing class, but prepare for the high workload ",
            "\u00a0Don't hesitate to work with others in the class.  I learned a lot from listening to Dana but I think I learned just as much from sitting with my classmates and working through problems together.  Also, go see the TA!  Ours was helpful, patient, and a genuinely nice human. ",
            "\u00a0Believe that each assignment will take, on average, 9 hours to create satisfying results. ",
            "\u00a0clear your schedule for 15 hours per week and align those hours with the TA's office hours. \r\nStay on top of the course work as well as in communication with the prof. \r\nYou'll learn a ton, and some are frustrated by trite nature of the homework examples, so apply the work to your interests. \r\n\r\nYou just have to get used to the pedagogical style of the prof and TA -- they're not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent at getting you up to speed with many basics in GIS and preparing you to learn more on your own. I wouldn't take it if you don't have a specific reason or strong interest given the workload (time consuming homework assignments). ",
            "\u00a0It takes a lot of your time. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you have the time to devote to assignments.  This class is a lot of work. ",

            "\u00a0Look carefully at your schedule. The weekly assignments, due 24 hours before class, often took better parts of a weekend day to complete, and there was almost no specific feedback given. The TA was very helpful and the best way to really learn GIS is by doing it. Use the TA. I definitely learned a lot, but I wasn't always happy about it. Find a group of fellow students to camp out in the computer lab with for moral and technical support. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you are going to need to use GIS at any time, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent if you have not used GIS before and want an introduction to raster data, and GIS generally.  Probably a bit basic if you already have some GIS skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course will take a lot of time, so make sure you do not stack this course on top of other courses with intense workloads. Also, I urge you to feel comfortable approaching Professor Tomlin whenever you have questions, because he is willing to take the time to answer your questions and feed your curiosity. ",
            "\u00a0Consider taking the vector course in the fall prior to this one. Dana doesn't spend much time on the fundamentals, so for someone with no experience in GIS, there might be a steep learning curve. Prepare to spend 8-12 hours per week on this, depending on your level of comfort and previous experience with the software. ",
            "\u00a0One assignment can take anywhere between 10 to 15 hours outside of class. Make good use of office hours. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not from FES, do not expect this class to learn how to geocode your information (i.e. for public health research) or for there to many relevant examples to your field. ",
            "\u00a0Expect to spend 10 hours a week on homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0You've probably already heard many things about this class, and most of them are probably true. The weekly assignments can be extremely time consuming and frustrating, but I also found them very rewarding, and overall was impressed with the level of understanding and ability imparted by this course. Professor Tomlin is very invested in students understanding why they use certain functions to address certain questions, and goes above and beyond in teaching this through his class. He is also very dedicated and will quickly reply to any email or Piazza questions, and is also more than willing to sit down with students and work through any conceptual difficulties or questions. "
