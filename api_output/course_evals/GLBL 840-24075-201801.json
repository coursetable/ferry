            "\u00a0I gained a good understanding of:\r\n- the functioning of the economies at a country's level,\r\n- some of the differences in the economic development between countries,\r\n- and of the main financial crises. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of how the economy works. How policies and decisions taken by the governments influence the economics cycles. It was also great introduction to the foundations of banking, central banks and insights on economic crises. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this macroeconomics class. I thought I learned a lot in it, and I now have a better grasp on they manner in which economic forces influence markets, banks, and politics. "

            "\u00a0The topics are fascinating and the class is well designed and well taught. I just think that the pace of the second half of the semester was much higher than the one of the first half. ",
            "\u00a0Having the option of discussion sections could help. ",
            "\u00a0There were a couple of things that I would have preferred to approach differently in the class. For example, I would rather focus on the story of economics rather than the models. I may be in the minority on this point, but as soon as equations got involved I got confused. Rather than saying that there was an increase in A  I would rather you just say that productivity or technology improved and that I increases a countrys output. I know the equations are very important to economics, but I'm never going to use them in my job, and sooner or later I will forget the formula. What I will not forget is the narrative story of why the economy is the way it is. Im sure this is a less accurate and full way of teaching economics, but this is the way that will stick with me throughout my career and will be most useful to me in it. I just want a basic understanding so I don't sound or act like an idiot when I talk about or make policy. "
