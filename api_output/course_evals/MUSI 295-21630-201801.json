            "\u00a0I think this class could be structured better. The only prerequisite was basic music theory knowledge, but many of my classmates had experience making/analyzing EDM. I felt as though they got a lot more out of the course than I did. Lecture was 2 hours a week while \"labs\" (where we actually learned how to use the computer program) were only 50 minutes a week. While the instructor attempted to teach us how to use the program in lecture, it was hard to follow simply by watching a screen. No instrument can be learned in that limited time, and I wish at the very least our time in lab vs class time was flipped. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was really great and definitely one of my favorite courses at Yale. I learned a whole lot about the creation of the music I love and how to recreate many of these techniques. If I had a complaint, it would largely just be that there could have been even more hands-on teaching of the techniques like in lab. I know that for myself and other students that I talked to in the class, this course was taken because of a love for the subject and we were definitely willing to put in the time even if the class was more intensive, for the sake of learning more and being able to exit the class with more experience. Still, this complaint is basically saying that this class was amazing and there was not enough of it. Other than that, perhaps lectures could be hands-on in the same way labs are; perhaps the Ableton examples in class could be sent out beforehand so they can be played with while concepts are being explained? But again, this is just a small thing I thought of for the sake of answering this question; I loved this class.\r\n\r\nThis was the only class that I found myself wanting to go to lecture / lab every week and wanting more of even during busier weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are long and sometimes very dry. but, lab is useful and the projects are worthwhile . ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course are fairly technical and could use fewer powerpoints, more demonstrations in Ableton. I would have also enjoyed being able to follow along in Ableton during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-skills-oriented, and, if you put the time in, you really do get a pretty thorough overview of ableton live software \r\n-assignments are quite diverse, and with the exception of the homeworks and midterm which often seemed like busy work (specifically the ones with multiple choice answers, fill in the blanks, etc.), they are usually pretty useful and helpful. I particularly enjoyed the analysis projects, the lab where we learned to perform and reproduce a song live, the lab where we got to do original re-harmonizations, and our final project. \r\n-Dr. A is excellent at working with Ableton Live, and has prepared helpful course materials for lectures and extra studying outside of class \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n-lectures are dry \r\n-more time should be spent discusses the history of the genre, the artists who make/made it, the people who listen to it, and other broader questions about EDM. We probably dont need so much time on the hyper-specific software manipulation, especially the kind thats specific to Ableton. At times, it felt like the course was a software tutorial more than an undergraduate class. That said, the vast majority of Ableton advice does carry over to other software and help us understand the nitty-gritty of how this music is really made. ",
            "\u00a0The largest weakness of the course was that it gives very little instruction on general usage of Ableton Live or on what kind of workflow one can use to create a piece in it. I found it daunting that the first time I opened an empty Ableton project was for the final (and I did not know how to do things like create instrument racks, work with a chain selector, change the length of a MIDI clip, create return tracks, or make groups of tracks - and these were all things I ended up using a lot after figuring them out by just poking all the buttons in Ableton).  Moreover, this had the side-effect that I changed my habits regarding session view vs. arrangement view midway through the final project, which caused some headaches. I feel that the course would be stronger if the task of creating something from a blank slate were addressed earlier on in the course so that these difficulties could be overcome before embarking on a substantial project. This is especially true given that the labs tended to focus on navigating very specific elements of Ableton, but always in the context of a pre-existing file.\r\n\r\nI thought the Lab D and E were particularly strong; I appreciated that they involved creative input from students, but still had fairly clear constraints. Some of the earlier labs felt rather repetitive, and felt like they took the operation of Ableton away from its musical context - which didn't really contribute to learning to use Ableton to realize a creative vision.\r\n\r\nI felt that the analysis projects were useful. At least for me, it was particularly useful to work with a partner, since they had a distinct musical background from me, and our combined analysis touched on aspects I had not considered. I also found it helpful at least to listen to the tunes chosen by other groups and to hear their analyses, although I think that the project encouraged analyses that were a bit too focused on particular technical aspects and missed larger purposes in the music.\r\n\r\nI didn't feel that the homework quizzes were helpful. The questions were often unclear (or relied on the word-for-word text of the slideshows given in class) and often didn't really seem to have clearly defined or meaningful answers. For instance, in the matching-type questions, unrelated concepts were grouped together, which made it primarily a laborious exercise - especially for things like genre, where the exercise often came down to knowing the BPMs given in class for various genres, which makes little headway towards understanding the genres. Fill-in-the-blank questions were downright frustrating, since sometimes the blanks were just qualitative and non-technical adjectives. Lectures often focused on this sort of too fine-grained detail about Ableton - they were strongest when they included musical examples in Ableton with varying parameters, rather than explaining what each knob was labelled.\r\n\r\nThe final project was a really good feature of the course. I liked that it was very unconstrained, but required using a broad spectrum of things in Ableton. Also, given that the final project was basically \"Do the thing you took this course to learn to do\", it was really effective in teaching me the things I wanted to know. It was also cool to hear the presentations of other students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Labs and hands on work\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit dry ",
            "\u00a0final project was the best part, weekly homeworks werent as helpful in learning the material ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a priceless opportunity to get hands-on experience with music production. Dr. A and the TAs are all very knowledgeable and helpful. The course could be improved if lectures were less dense and provided more interactive opportunities to apply the information on the slides. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, however it is geared toward beginners. The class will start to get fun a little over half way through for those with some experience in Ableton. While classes were great, I was not the biggest fan of the Lab Assignments. As someone decently versed in Ableton, I found the assignments tedious and uncreative. I understand that the point of the assignments was to show kids how to use Ableton, but many of the assignments had no room for creativity built into them. I understand that a more free form style of lab would create some issues for grading and creating a rubric, but I think it would greatly enhance the level of commitment with the labs. Favorite assignment by far was the final project since I could just let loose and make what I wanted. Really got dinged a lot on the lab assignments for going outside the box sometimes (also submitting an hour late sometimes). Although this didn't really hurt my overall grade, it felt to lose points for getting creative. ",
            "\u00a0The primary weakness of the course is that the lecture format is just not conducive to fostering a good understanding of Ableton or music production. The real learning occurs in the lab and in actually sitting down in front of the computer and using the software. I feel like if the class were shifted to a lab setting fully, it would be a lot more effective. ",
            "\u00a0A really cool course, probably one of the most fun topics to have a class on. I do wish Dr. A actually live-demoed the different effects so we can see everything in action. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to anybody who has a background making EDM. Otherwise, I would not. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to any student interested in electronic music (which these days is many students). Dr. A is great, and you learn a whole lot. Literally the \"lab\" and the \"quizzes\" are you either creating original music in Ableton or analyzing and adjusting existing music in Ableton, which is just as fun as it sounds. The workload and grading wasn't nearly as intensive as I was worried about, and if anything you'll wish there were even more labs / projects. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it is good for those who want to learn about edm, or improve ableton chops ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to a student who is interested in EDM but has never worked in a DAW or at least has never composed EDM before. This class is definitely not for students who are comfortable using Ableton already. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in learning about how to make music in an EDM style, then I would recommend it as a fun extra course! Youll spend most time learning how to use Ableton software. There are weekly labs and homework (which take about 1-2 hours each, which the exception of the quiz 1effectively the midterm, which was quite extensive and tedious, but not hard), 2 relatively relaxed analysis presentations, and a final project (which can be flexible and you have a lot of freedom to make it what you want). None of the work was particularly hard, even if youre terrible with technology and come in with zero background (though I imagine itd be a bit harder if you dont have any background in music-makingIm speaking as someone whos very comfortable with music theory and writing musicthis is definitely not required, but makes the course much easier because then those become elements that dont require much thought and you can primarily focus on the production side of things.) Definitely consider the class as a fun thing to take to get a break from your typical Yale course and explore a passion in a relatively relaxed way! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in producing EDM or other forms of electronic music, this is the course for you! Lots of hands on labs, focus on theory and composition. ",
            "\u00a0if youre committed to putting in time and really want to learn ableton and how to listen to electronic music, definitely take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a chill course to take but you still get to produce meaningful work. ",
            "\u00a0If a student is interested in Ableton I would say take it. Although its geared toward absolute beginners, the pace may be a little quick. Just make sure you put in your time with the software and you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0If you are actually interested in learning music production, specifically learning Ableton, then I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in electronic music or producing. "
