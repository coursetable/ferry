            "\u00a0Reporting skills, writing, storyteling ",
            "\u00a0Developed reportorial and craft techniques when it comes to ideation, interviewing, and editing. ",
            "\u00a0I came away from this course both with a much more comprehensive understanding of and a much deeper appreciation for long-form journalism. I not only learned the tools and techniques required to write an excellent magazine story but I also now have greater admiration for the craft  and a more intimate awareness of the importance of truth-finding and storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interview victims of trauma, use court documents to source long-form pieces, and pitch stories effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from Professor Stillman! My writing improved immensely, and unlike most other classes, I gained concrete skills to improve my ideation, reporting, and writing. This was definitely by far one of  if not the most  worthwhile class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stillman equips her students with as comprehensive a conceptual toolkit and practical skillset as any reporter/writer could dream of. Some key concepts (like the \"ladder of abstraction\") you already know and instinctively deploy in your writing, but actually recognizing and labeling it allows you use it with far more intentionality than before. Other ideas are adjacent to the familiar (like \"greening\"), providing just enough of a tweak to open new theoretical vistas of possibilities. Still others are just new altogether (at least for me). No matter what, you're guaranteed to emerge from this course with some tangible, readily applicable skills. I marveled at the thoroughness of the syllabus--Stillman guides her students from the very beginning of the reporting process (ideation, the stage that I tend to struggle with) to the fine-combing that marks the end (revision), and everything in between (structure, etc). Perhaps most importantly, Stillman opened my eyes to the inexhaustible potentialities of long-form journalism, a genre that I already knew was incredibly versatile. The collection of carefully curated readings served as a gallery of possibilities, from stories that reconstructed future events to ones that applied the the tools of reportage to memoir. Ultimately, I left this class with a sharper sense of my strengths as a writer-reporter, more comfort tackling the tasks that daunted me (like determining story structure), and even greater excitement at what I know I can do as a journalist moving forward.

            "\u00a0So many strengths! The readings, the information and tools for talking about works of writing, and finally the guidance on our own investigative and immersive pieces. I also really liked workshopping with a small class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything, from instructor to course materials and assignments. \r\nWeakness: n/a ",
            "\u00a0This course is all-around excellent. It is a phenomenal study of long-form nonfiction narrative, requiring students to analyze and interrogate some of the genre's very best works while also enabling students to produce their own stories. The course covers all facets of long-form journalism, from the ideation process to reporting and finally writing, and it forces students to think critically about voice, structure, and journalism ethics.  The course's only weakness is the workload; I found it difficult to produce two thoroughly-reported and carefully-written magazine-length pieces. I think working on one story of twice the length might be more doable. That said, I still very much appreciated being able to tackle different topics and think through the different issues posed by different pieces. All in all, this is one of the very best courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Professor Stillman's compassion, high engagement with every student, and organization.\r\nThere are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were so fascinating, and class was always fun and interesting. My only qualm, which is very small, was that I found it very difficult to produce two great pieces in the semester. I felt very confident with one but not the other. Perhaps one of the pieces could have been shorter than the other, which would have made it a bit easier to produce two pieces I was really proud of. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much everything is perfect--the professor, the readings, the workshops, the classmates. That said, I did have two (very minor) reservations. Firstly, we often didn't have time to discuss all the readings, which was a shame because there were some absolutely fantastic ones that I would have enjoyed analyzing with the class and under Stillman's tutelage. Secondly, the second half of the semester, especially the final third, moves at a far more breakneck pace than the first, in part due to the number of assignments due for workshop every week. I wonder if the workload can be a little more evenly distributed. Ultimately, though, these were but nicks in an otherwise flawless semester. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly engaged, talented, and thoughtful professor  she's probably the person best equipped to teach this class in the world! The class workshops each of your pieces once, and my peers were supportive and provided helpful critiques at the same time. Plus, it's cool to see what everyone's working on. You read really amazing pieces, and get a lot of support to complete two intensely researched and well-edited pieces. What you get out is what you put in, though - be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class on reporting. Downsides are few (I would absolutely recommend this class) but one small note is: two 4000-word pieces is a lot to get done to your satisfaction in a semester, so you might just have to accept that one will be better than the other. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Stillman is smart, kind, dedicated, perceptive, hard-working, etc. You'll learn a ton how to mine documents for narrative detail, how to come up with successful story ideas, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Love this course! Definitely grew as a writer and storyteller. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was an incredible workshop on long-form writing. You learn so many skills on how to report stories and craft a strong, meaningful final piece. It was definitely an intense course, particularly the writing and reporting of the two class assignments, but definitely worth all the work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn a lot about journalism in such an intimate, productive, and supportive setting. This class has an INSANE amount of work though, so don't be fooled by the fact that it's only 1 credit. There are two long-form pieces with edits for both of them. Keep in mind that this is all in addition to tons of interviewing, reading, and workshopping. It all ends up worth it, though. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It is very challenging, but you will come away from it a better reader, writer, thinker, storyteller, observer, and empathizer. For anyone interested in writing -- especially long-form -- this course is a must-take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is the greatest course I've taken at Yale by far--no course at Yale has better prepared me to pursue journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! One hundred percent. The readings were some of the best in long-form journalism. And you get to learn from the best and craft pieces that you will be really proud of. ",
            "\u00a0What a wonderful, wonderful course. Yale offers its students a fairly loaded table of quality journalism seminars, but even then ENGL 480 manages to distinguish itself. When it comes to the course material, Professor Stillman is as insightful as she is invested (a combination not to be taken for granted). Her mix of rigorous expectations and unrelenting warmth cultivated a class environment that was competitive without losing its hospitality. She managed to assemble the perfect class roster--my classmates were all brilliant thinkers, strong writers, and all around great people who taught me a great deal. This course will leave you with both concrete practical skills and an expanded imaginative capacity. Not only will you emerge as a journalist with far greater ambition, you will possess the tools necessary to make such ambition reality. Take this if you can. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably my favorite class at Yale. You could not ask for a better professor, the reading list is fun and interesting, and the reporting projects are a big and worthwhile challenge. I would recommend this class over any other journalism class at Yale, also I think Prof. Stillman is creative, ethical, and invested in her students in a way that I haven't seen in any other class, and if you're going to learn long-form journalism, follow her method.
