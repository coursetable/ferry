            "\u00a0I was really glad to understand antisemitism better through texts across academic disciplines. In addition to providing a good background in the subject matter, this class exposed me to higher-level discussion in philosophy and political science in addition to analysis of older texts. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new vocabulary for discussing antisemitism and modern political thought more broadly, and gained practice at close reading of political philosophy. ",

            "\u00a0This was an excellent class taught by an extremely knowledgeable and insightful professor (Adam Stern). I loved how class each week was dominated by discussion rather than lecture. If I could change something, I wouldve loved to have a few guiding questions prior to reading some of the more difficult texts. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you have the chance to take this class with Adam Stern, take it. This is a new look at antisemitism far beyond what the news covers, and it goes much deeper into providing readings from multiple disciplines within the humanities and social sciences than most classes at Yale. The readings were all SO GOOD (Ive even forwarded them to some friends Ive been so interested). The class is mostly discussion, so be prepared to speak, and DEFINITELY do the readings because it will be very obvious if you dont. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student; it was interesting and engaging, and I grew as a writer and a thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, you really read great material on antisemitism. "
