            "\u00a0I developed many new skills in this class.  I now have the ability to think as a syntactician, turning over complex puzzles and proposing and testing possible solutions.  This skill is not only applicable to syntax, but also to all other intellectual challenges.  I also gained a wide knowledge of syntactic theories which are important for my training as a linguist. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered advanced syntax, but moved a lot more toward formulating and testing our own ideas about the structure of sentences rather than simply being provided with concrete answers. As a result, a lot of the course required more independent thinking and reasoning, and how to think like a linguist in order to approach a problem (and write a paper on it). ",
            "\u00a0God I learned a lot in this course. It kind of deconstructs everything you think you know from Intro and Syntax I in a great way and builds it back up from the basics. I learned how to read/write syntax papers (though I could have done with more practice in both areas), how to think like a minimalist, etc. "

            "\u00a0This class was taught at a high level so the learning curve was steep. This was both very rewarding but also quite difficult. I think it counts as both the strength and weakness of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the flexibility of the course; the pace and content was adjusted down as necessary to ensure that students had enough time to process the information. The workload and balance of readings, class time, assignments, and papers was also good, and each activity overall had a clear way of contributing to our understanding of the topic and our ability to think and write like a linguist. \r\n\r\nI often felt overwhelmed by the course content. Although we did not cover much, each individual topic took a lot of effort to understand. It would have been nice if I had the chance to practice things repeatedly or to go through multiple examples of thinking through a hypothesis and discussing what predictions I made, rather than using just one thing as an example and then being expected to apply that one example in an outside assignment. I think if I were to retake the course I would budget a lot more time and seek out independent help from the professor, but if some of these changes were to be implemented during class (getting through a larger volume of practice discussing analyses and their predictions) I think that would really help. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who are very serious about advancing their linguistic knowledge. It is difficult but rewarding, and I think my enthusiasm for linguistics was what kept me engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who has a deep interest in syntax or in learning to think and write like a linguist. Probably, this will mean you are a linguistics major with prior experience in the subject. I would provide the advice to budget a lot of time for the course. Although the material is not a lot and the coursework is manageable, getting to the point where you understand the content fully and are able to, for example, write high quality midterm and final papers will take a lot of independent review, going in for extra help, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it's pretty indispensable if you're interested in being a competent and thoughtful syntactician or linguist "
