            "\u00a0This course does not meet often enough. Each student only presents 1-2 times per year, so spends most of their time describing basics of their project and answering questions that help the class understand the study, but does not allow for really deep discussion of complex issues the student is facing. Since we present so infrequently, we have to work most issues out on our own/with our advisor, rather than having dissertation seminar serve as a sounding board for the problems or decisions we regularly face. If I have decision to be made about my study in September, but don't present until November, it's likely I have already resolved that issue, especially for those on the three year program--they can't wait. Right now dissertation seminar feels more like an update to show we are getting something done than actually helpful to the student presenting. If we met weekly or every other week, and people gave a small update or asked for feedback on a specific issue, I think that would be more effective. Maybe the class could then be 1-2 hours instead of 3, which would help with attention. ",
