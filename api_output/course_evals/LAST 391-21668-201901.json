            "\u00a0This course taught me how to actually read literature: how to engage with the material beyond a superficial first read and how to identify and interpret the common themes that run through novels from different time periods, different continents, and different authors. Throughout the course of the semester, I felt that I was able to develop a newfound appreciation for the interconnectedness of many of the works we read. During class discussions, we uncovered recurring elements that unified diverse novels and short stories and discussed the cultural context that gave rise to such elements. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first literature class, and I learned a great deal about analyzing literature and writing about literature. "

        [
            "\u00a0Professor Adorno is perhaps the greatest strength of this course. Her encyclopedic knowledge of the novels we read, the individualized attention she gave each member of the class, and her clear enthusiasm for the subject matter made class discussions about Faulkner feel almost inviting. Please, please take this class with her if you get the chance! The literature is diverse and, by virtue of the course topic, less U.S.-centric than in many other courses, which was refreshing. I genuinely looked forward to this course every day, despite the fact that the first half of the semester was punctuated by the incessant noise of a jackhammer somewhere outside the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the pace of the readings in this course. We had time to discuss many important aspects of the novels and short stories we read in both languages. I was always excited to come to class. Professor Adorno is quite a character, and she brings a lot of life the class community. Professor Adorno was also very supportive when reading through our essays and always offered constructive advice on our writing. One thing I did not like so much was how heavily the class revolved around powerpoints. The class was only ~10 people, and the readings were so exciting that it felt like a shame to stick to a powerpoint script when there was so much more to discuss every class. By far my favorite days in this class were when we focused on our own observations instead of sticking to the powerpoint. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great syllabus that span a wide temporal range. At the beginning of the semester there is a focus on short stories, which is a rarer genre in literature classes. I also thought the distribution of assigned readings was exceedingly fairProf. Adorno prefers that you read less but in depth, than read more and skim. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great insight from Professor Adorno and very helpful especially for those who are receiving an introduction to literature\r\nWeaknesses - since Professor Adorno was so good at faciliting dialogue, I wish we had a bit more of it ",
            "\u00a0Great progression of readings that build off of each other's themes, and a stupendous instructor can ensure you will enjoy the class. The amount of work is also very reasonable, lots of reading yes, obviously, but other than that only 4 relatively short papers throughout the semester, plus a final paper. Just enough to keep you honest and engaged, but not too much to pull you out of enjoying the readings. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Even though it's a literature course, most of the people in the seminar were not literature majors, which made for a (perhaps) less intimidating environment than might be found in other, similar classes. Discussions were very interesting, engagement was high, the papers were not too bad (despite the fact that there were four of them, plus a final paper), and the readings were all wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The readings are wonderful, and it was great to get to know Professor Adorno. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because the premise of the classthe juxtaposition of American and Latin American authors who have something in commonis very interesting, and allows for a varied reading list. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Awesome comparison across languages and I recommend reading all texts in their original language ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. You read an incredible curation of books and short stories from writers across North and South America, and learn to make compelling comparisons between works you wouldn't have originally thought comparable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lots of fun. And go to the optional section if you can, it's totally casual and fun and she brings cookies "
