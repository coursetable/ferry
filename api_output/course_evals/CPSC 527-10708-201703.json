            "\u00a0This course is pretty informative! It would be better if there exist some lecture notes about concepts that would help us do the review after class and before exams. Also, for assignments, I would prefer clearer description and requirements, and for test cases, instead of letting us trying to imagine all kinds of possible situation by ourselves, it would be better if it is clear what input will get what kinds of output. Another possibility would be, we could get an executable file about the sample game we are supposed to write. With this sample executable, we could play around and understand what we should get for certain inputs. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a good overview of OOP although the second half was a bit scattered as we went into design patterns that included implementations in other languages. Getting feedback sooner in grading assignments would have been helpful. ",

This course is beyond my expectation because of him.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It is a bit challenging for non-CS majored students. I have to pick up lots of concepts mentioned in class and because there is no handout of this course, I did find it hard to follow especially at the beginning of this course. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The course assumes almost no pre-requisites on the part of the students. And by the end of the class a student would certainly become proficient with C++ and OOP concepts. The instructor did an excellent job with the course: he gave excellent examples, taugh concepts not just theoretically but by illustrating them in class by programming. The programming assignments were very well designed and increased in difficulty gradually.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more timely grading of assignments would be very useful for us students. But at the same time I do understand that it isn't an easy task to prepare ~100 testcases per assignment. ",
