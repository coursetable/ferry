As a student interested in how Asian nations grapple with futurism and modernism, I found that this class was worthwhile. However, if you are not interested in China, East Asia, or maybe China's global influence, this class isn't for you. Also, I found the lecture size to be too big. There were over a hundred students enrolled in the class but it felt like less than half of them showed up. With the class relying heavily on discussions and class participation, I think that it should be capped in the future to ensure that engagement is there. ",

We touched on a lot of relevant topics and had a lot of interesting readings, but unfortunately the poor logistical planning of the course on behalf of the teaching staff really detracted from the quality of the course. Our readings oftentimes were not posted until a day or two before they were due, and there was also a general lack of communication and intimacy between the students and the TAs. Most notably, the professor would oftentimes come to class unprepared, with no slides and just a vague sense of direction, hoping that asking broad open-ended questions would amount to an hour's worth of class. That being said, Jing Tsu is a captivating and charismatic speaker and an engaging professor. I think teaching this course in such a big lecture isn't optimal for learning, and is a waste of a great professor. ",

The lectures also wasn't planned out well, and it is clear that the effort put into preparing this class frankly wasn't adequate - she would drag on an discussion/monologue without any substance, and still end up letting us leave early. Since the assignments are so easy, it is almost impossible to discern good students from bad ones in terms of grading. I am overall really disappointed in how the prof taught this class, not only failing to teach in an effective way, but also letting discussions go way out of hand, where some fairly offensive comments are blatantly made. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material that is extremely important, but the course sometimes felt flowery and the readings were overly onerous, which discouraged anyone from doing them. The film final project format I felt did not help encourage my learning or processing of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job in providing information and perspective about many different aspects of modern China, how it came to be, and what exactly they are doing in order to develop their society and global status. All of the readings were very interesting, and I enjoyed doing them. Being able to engage with different forms of material - news articles, historical reports, UN and other global organization reports, a movie, and science fiction writing - was really great because it allowed me to really analyze the issues at hand through a variety of media, and I learned more because of that.\r\n\r\nFor me, one of the main weaknesses of the course was the size. I feel like this course would have been much more meaningful and beneficial if it were taught as a seminar rather than a lecture, because it would give students the opportunity to really reflect on the material and share their opinions. Professor Tsu tried to facilitate class discussions, but it was never very effective because not many people want to participate in a lecture-wide discussion in Davies Auditorium. I felt like the discussions, then, were very detached because it's very difficult to have a meaningful discussion with your peers when you cannot really see or acknowledge the other people. I also would've liked more feedback on the assignments, since I never received comments once I got the grades back and I would've liked comments on what I could improve if I got points taken off for some reason. There also were no criteria for what the TAs were looking for in terms of grading our assignments, and that would have been helpful to know what they were looking for so that we could have given the proper details or level of analysis in our assignments. Instead, it kind of felt like shooting an arrow in the dark and hoping that it turned out okay. ",

There were way too many people in that class to be able to effectively have deep discussions. This class needs discussion sections each week. The TAs seem interested enough to do it and it would be so useful for students. ",

            "\u00a0The class size is too big, making it hard to conduct deeper intellectual discussion in the class. Even though there is weekly reading responses, the level of engagement and discussion is not as satisfying as an in-class discussion.\r\n\r\nA lot of interesting topics have been covered, but the readings are quite heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very cool material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the grading structure made no sense AT ALL. How can participation count for 30% of my grade when there are 500 people in lecture and there is no section? What? I also had very little communication with my TA. Major assignments were not explained well. ",

            "\u00a0This course is designed badly -- it is a low-engagement 150-person lecture that the professor attempts to run as a discussion-based seminar, so many of the students that actually continue to show up week after week (much fewer than 150) end up repeatedly projecting their opinions to the room with little opportunity for critical discussion. The class as currently designed would work well if it were very small, and Jing Tsu is a great professor despite her strange choices about the course format. I have one main recommendation: this class MUST have mandatory sit-down discussion sections for it to play the role it should on campus, since the content is so important. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure why we focused so many of the final weeks of the semester on Chinese science fiction -- I realize that it involves imagining a future and that there are interesting cultural threads to follow there, but it did not feel important enough for the amount of time we spent on it. ",
            "\u00a0The class could've been more interactive. They were assigning a lot of pages of reading for every lecture, and because of the heavy workload people didn't actually do the work and therefore couldn't participate. I would reduce the amount of reading by a lot. ",

I wish we spend substantially more time on China's economy (e.g., recent expansion of Arctic shipping lanes, Chinese SOEs in Africa and in the Belt and Road Initiative).

However, the professor has unrealistic expectations for a lecture of this size, and should make the readings more manageable. I got away this semester with doing essentially none of the readings, but at times it was difficult as many of our writing assignments were based on the readings. However, the amount of readings assigned for this are excessive and quite frankly, annoying. (for example, 800 pages were assigned over spring break). Additionally, if things go quiet during discussions, the prof. will pass around the microphone throughout the audience (particularly those in the back of the auditorium) and then randomly choose a person to talk when he/she receives the microphone. Overall, the class is a good way to knock out a humanities credit and do fairly well, but the class itself could be quite annoying and frustrating at times. ",

Even those who had a lot of prior knowledge could learn a lot from interacting with other students and seeing how they viewed certain events. \r\n\r\nWorkload was not heavy, but there is little feedback received throughout the course and grading is not very clear. Even when attendance was taken, many people did not show up and half the class was not very engaged. Difficult to interact with required class discussion posts when many responders were clearly unknowledgeable about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you want an easy class, yes. If not - no. It isn't engaging and I did not learn much. ",
            "\u00a0I would. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class if you don't know anything about China or current east asian affairs, but since I already knew most of it, I didn't learn as much as I expect/as I could. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think China is a rapidly growing country that will affect many of our futures, no matter the careers we choose. Understanding a little more about all of the topics we covered in class will only help. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you have little knowledge of Chinese affairs. ",
            "\u00a0No. The instructor failed to structure the in-class debate in a meaningful and effective way, leaving broad questions to the class that no-one had answers to. The lectures also wasn't planned out well, and it is clear that the effort put into preparing this class frankly wasn't adequate - she would drag on an discussion/monologue without any substance, and still end up letting us leave early. Since the assignments are so easy, it is almost impossible to discern good students from bad ones in terms of grading. I am overall really disappointed in how the prof taught this class, not only failing to teach in an effective way, but also letting discussions go way out of hand, where some fairly offensive comments are blatantly made. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. While the grading policies and the set-up of the class (in terms of class discussions in Davies) were kind of strange, I did learn a ton in this class and I've been able to talk with people, including the Chinese members of my family, about issues involving modern China to a much greater extent than I could have before taking this class. It really gave me a lot of perspective on another country, which is important to me because I want to be able to learn about other nations and what they are doing in the world, not just focusing on the United States. Also, there wasn't too much work in this class and it served as a nice break from the heavier classes in my schedule while still teaching a lot of very interesting and cool material. ",
            "\u00a0Not sure ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it was so interesting and Professor Tsu's guest speakers were so useful. The topics, from China's space program, to the Belt Road Initiative, to Chinese science fiction were extremely engaging topics that I will think about for years to come. This course brought my attention to so many topics that I had not thought of before and I am so glad that I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0No, because it is difficult to fully engage with the material ",
            "\u00a0The readings are quite heavy although some of them are really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Dont take this class unless you need to. ",
            "\u00a0it was fine, but i think a little disorganized ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since the content is incredibly interesting and useful, but it needs to be redesigned to engage people who take it as a gut. ",
            "\u00a0No. I didn't enjoy it at all. ",
            "\u00a0I was genuinely so excited to take this class, but after 6-7 weeks found myself completely disillusioned. Though the topics/syllabus were interesting, the execution was terrible. We spent tons of time discussing Chinese language and writing, which made it very exclusionary for people who cannot speak Chinese in any capacity. I took this class precisely because I know nothing about China/wanted an overview, and found myself being told to \"stay away from stereotypes\" that I did not even understand in their entirety before taking the course. Watching movies like Wolf Warrior 2, in all honesty, only reinforced some of these stereotypes for me. \r\n\r\nCold-calling in lecture was the absolute worst. I understand that it is to no one's benefit to not do class readings, but it made me dread going to lecture because I would feel that if I could not provide a substantive enough answer (as someone who is not Chinese and knows very little about China), I could be told in front of the entire class that my answer was a \"nice, easy, off-the-cuff response that next time should be better\", as was told to other students in a full lecture hall. Especially when long readings are assigned over school breaks, I always felt like I was doing tons of busy work for no reason, that in no way enhanced my understanding of what initially seemed like interesting topics. I also felt that the general environment was very hostile and competitive since in-class participation counted for so much of our gradepeople who have been able to travel/live in China would have many more confident points to make compared to others simply trying to understand ideas, and these points often had nothing to do with the readings (which is perfectly OK, but likely defeats the purpose of putting so much weight on a participation grade). \r\n\r\nFinally, the final project made little to no sense from my point of view. My team spent more time trying to figure out how to make a video on iMovie, and how to delegate responsibility amongst ourselves (i.e. it is cumbersome to try to have 4 people come to agreements on creative ideas for how a film script should work), than actually thinking about the topics we covered throughout the year in any way. Meeting with the TA when we were stuck brought us tons of confusion with ZERO clarity, since we were left to \"think about everything a bit more and try to figure it out.\" There were no guidelines provided until after we submitted the assignment, so it was incredibly stressful for reasons entirely separate from the class material and trying to grapple with it. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend to take this classmy experience with it, regardless of a final grade, was not easy, pleasant, or academically enriching. This is a shame, since so many people discuss China in all of my other classes and I really wanted to walk away with some semblance of profound understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Class was graded relatively easy which took pressure away from technicalities and allowed for honest learning. ",
            "\u00a0It's definitely an exciting course to learn more about the ins and outs of China's geopolitical rise, but it was not as intellectually rigorous as I had hoped. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good fifth class and if you put the work in you'll learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Needs to be reorganized. Should either be offered as a seminar or a lecture with more standardization across TA's. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. I really appreciated the contemporary focus of the class in particular! ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are interested in learning more about Chinese society, culture, and history. If you are not interested in China at all, it is still a nice lecture class that you will learn something from (Professor Tsu's passion makes it pretty impossible to ignore the course, even if you have zero interest in China) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Easy course, professor Tsu is nice and knows what she's talking about ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a good humanities credit and is great if you are interested in learning about China. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to all majors. It is super interesting and you get out of the class as much as you put in. ",
            "\u00a0If there are sections and it's not just one giant lecture, then I would definitely recommend this course. Otherwise, I would be hesitant, but you do get a decent amount out of this class even without it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I think a student would be better served doing their own guided reading on China. Class discussions and assignments didn't add particularly much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is very knowledgeable about all the course material covered, and the topics are all pretty interesting for anyone wanting to learn more about China. However, the course can feel a bit unorganized at certain points. ",
            "\u00a0If youre looking for a light workload class to add and are fine being one of hundreds of faces in a lecture, go for it. Otherwise, there might be other courses that offer more engagement while covering the same topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The content is this class naturally changes as China's position in the world changes, so the material covered never becomes out-of-date. If you want a good crash course in China, this is the class to take. ",
            "\u00a0yes because China is an important actor in world politics and I think it is important to learn more about their history. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! its a great class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it is a really interesting class and the material is extremely relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it gives a nice insight into China and allows one to have a good understanding of how America and Chinese relations are going to develop in the future. ",
            "\u00a0You can do well in this course without too much work. And some parts are interesting (Chinese economy, Arctic shipping lanes, state-owned enterprises in Africa, etc) while others are dreadful (Chinese calligraphy). "
