            "\u00a0I learned about many challenges facing humans today, from plastics to pesticides to the food sector. This class made me aware of many new issues (such as food certification and palm oil) and furthered my knowledge and the pervasiveness of many other topics. ",

It taught me the significance of the food system in terms of environmental damage and how much needs to change. It gave me a deeper knowledge of a specific research topic and how to address the problem and solution in essay format. Overall it really enlightened me about the (lack of) regulation controlling the food system and how this compares to drug and nuclear use. ",

            "\u00a0The information we learned throughout the course was tremendously and shockingly relevant to our everyday life. I have not yet had a class whose affect I could feel so consistently outside the classroom in terms of noticing aspects of the food systems around me I had not understood. On the other hand, the pacing of lecture slides often presented an obstacle to staying engaged in the course and I believe led to many people not attending all the lectures in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought strengths were content chosen and delivery. I think weakness was the professor ran over time every single lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Section was really fun and the topics were new to me ",
            "\u00a0Its good ",
            "\u00a0There is no other course like this at Yale, and I think the perspectives provided in the course teach you to think about the environment in a much deeper way. With that being said, this course is not suited for a lecture. The professor did not seem comfortable leading the lecture and tried covering way too much for the class to be engaging or enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course felt like it was bouncing around a lot and that there could have been a lot more depth on all topics ",
            "\u00a0I think some of the readings could have been more engaged with the topics and the lecture powerpoint themselves might have been better structured with the information necessary for us to understand, learn, remember for the paper topics or exam. ",
            "\u00a0Some weaknesses would definitely be that lectures were not always engaging and slides were often hard to follow. However, I think the course material is fascinating and if you really engage with it, you will get a lot out of section and the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were too long, and we never has enough time to finish the lecture in 50 mins. In addition, the paper assignments could have been much more straight forward. ",
            "\u00a0I dont think the format of the final exam was goodi think having more shorter answers would be better.\r\n\r\nI also think the order or topics was a little unintuitive. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. Professor Wargo is a very insightful professor with lots of knowledge to share. Lecture was only 50 min, twice a week so a lot of info was crammed into that time. Section was very useful, as students were pushed to consider many perspectives and different solutions to the problems we discussed. The papers (2000 to 2500 words) were also not overbearing. They were just long enough to require students to really look in depth into their chosen topics, but not long enough to pose a real burden on getting them done. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not very well organized or easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed there was never enough time in lecture to cover everything that needed to be said. However, I believe those responsible for teaching did the best they could, it is a huge topic. ",

            "\u00a0Sometimes disorganized. Lectures could get rambley. Didnt always tie together well. Lots of facts thrown at you. ",
            "\u00a0The content in the course is truly fascinating and something I believe everyone should learn. It was at times very depressing and quite frightening but I think the overall message from the lectures and sections was very thought provoking and it made me reconsider many aspects of my life. I loved discussion section and always came away wanting to know more about the topic. I liked the range of subjects covered but think some sections could be covered in more depth. Great feedback from the TA. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the course didn't have much organisation. It presented itself as being about the environment, but for a straight month, none of the lecture topics touched on the environment, except for very superficial connections that felt more thrown in there to keep things semi relevant rather than actually thought out. It's also called \"global\" food challenges, but the focus of this course was not global at all. It was very US focused, with some splashes of the EU. And even within the US, it failed to address different socio-economic perspectives and experiences, it treated the entirety of the country as a single type of consumer. \r\nA strength I would say is that it really allows the student to explore topics they're interested in for the papers. This kind of also contributed to the class feeling disjointed, but I appreciated having that liberty. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course was that it was really broad. As an EVST major interested in food systems, I had already read about a lot of the things we talked about in class. As we go over so many topics, we don't go particularly in-depth on any of the topics, so sometimes it was frustrating because I felt like we did not go in depth enough. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - lecture could be dry, slides could be better organized, dry lectures occasionally\r\nStrengths - the topics were SO INTERESTING and Wargo was so well-informed. Wow. I left every lecture with my mind blown and flummoxed by the idea of lunch. How could I eat after learning about endocrine-disrupting pesticide or plastic residue on my food? ",
            "\u00a0I found that the lecture sometimes moved too fast and the overall semester format was quite confusing. The class engagement was not very high and this made it hard to be motivated in this class and in section. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in understanding the complexity of the food systems around us and their problems. Taking EVST 255 opened my eyes to many aspects of the world which I otherwise would have not paid any attention to. I will warn that if the class does not seem sufficiently interesting to you during shopping period then I would advise against taking the class. ",

If youre a freshman and want to learn a bit about food/environment and practice writing in a low stress way, this could be a good course for you. I cant say that I got a lot out of it though, but its my fault for waiting until my last semester of college. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Very interesting topic that can relate to everyone as well as many topics and majors not considered similar. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It has changed my thinking about our environment and the ways that I can change my own living habits to have less of a negative environmental impact. I also feel like I learned so much new material that I did not know, and it's really made me a more conscious consumer. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Really interesting and important topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much about things that are relevant to my everyday life. I got great feedback on my papers, both after submission and during the process of writing. I probably learned more about writing than I have in any other class (though I am only a first year). As a first year, I was challenged by the ability of upperclassmen to absorb so much information and speak concisely about it in section. This made me work hard to try to develop those speaking and information-gathering skills. As an EVST or PLSC credit, you won't find a more interesting class with information that is really relevant to your life. ",
            "\u00a0I would. This is a very interesting topic worth learning of, regardless of your major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is so important, especially now that so many people do not understand how food is made and what resources the process takes. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! The information learned in this class is necessary for everyone to have, in order to make positive environmental change in years to come. It is beneficial for understanding climate change, as well as how these modern-day climate issues are intersectional with race and class. I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone with even the slightest interest in these topics, as they are topics in which everyone should have a basic level understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you need EVST humanities it's one of the better choices ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the content is something I believe everyone should learn and very interesting. It will change the way you look at the wold. The structure and workload of the course is also very manageable. ",

            "\u00a0Yes to fill a course requirement but, I did not enjoy it as much as I expected. It was horrifying learning about the global challenges with little focus on what solutions could be and which are achievable. ",
