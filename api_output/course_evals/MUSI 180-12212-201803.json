            "\u00a0Having already been a rock music fan for most of my life, I assumed that this class would be full of a lot of factoids I already knew. However, the story of rock that Harrison tells in this course is truly mind expanding and has allowed me to hear this music with fresh ears. I am a musician and have a fairly extensive knowledge of theory in comparison to the rest of the students in this class, but as it turned out I couldn't just rely on my previous knowledge to, for example, identify songs on the listening quizzes or write the essay. This class really required a level of engagement that you don't often see in large lectures which I consider a great thing. To do well in this class, you actually had to read the book, listen to lecture, and take good notes. Rock history is such an enormous beast that succeeding in this class meant learning the relevant facts as they applied to the relevant individuals, but also understanding the general arc and sub-arcs of each movement in the history of rock. Thus, it wasn't just rote memory and regurgitating facts; the material I learned in this class will likely stay with me for some time. ",

            "\u00a0This course was really engaging and fun to be apart of. Having the opportunity to attend class, listen to music, and learn about music was awesome. The way the course was tested was challenging and maybe not most effective, but it certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment and engagement with the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was easily my favorite course at Yale, and I appreciate all music so much more after having taken the class. It was a pleasure to come to lecture and listen to new music, watch music videos, as well as learn how music has developed throughout history, building upon its predecessors. The TAs are amazing and section is always an enjoyable experience, with activities, music, and videos. Some frustrating things about the course are Professor Harrison's loyalty to the textbook, which places emphasis on some random artists and songs. The midterm is largely about memorizing facts (artists, albums, producers, record labels, years), which was hard to study for and seemed like information that wasn't integral for understanding how rock music has progressed through history. Professor Harrison sometimes places too much of an emphasis on music theory by using the Timeliner Analysis software to analyze almost every song we listen to throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are a bit dry, but regardless, the number of new songs and artists you are exposed to easily makes up for it. ",
            "\u00a0Tests are incredibly random and borderline impossible to study for. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were unnecessarily difficult. Its nearly impossible to memorize every detail needed to take the tests. The TAs did the best they could to prepare us, but the majority of the course was not helpful for the exam as we needed to memorize the entire book to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I think we focused on form and music theory too much. For those of us without music background, it was really hard to grasp and was not necessarily helpful to appreciating rock music. I wanted to spend more time on the history part. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrison is great, but I think he tried to pack too much into the course for the time available. The workload was pretty crazy when it came down to a listening quiz or the midterm or final. There was just too much information to study, and I feel the list of things we needed to know should have been narrowed down in scope. I spent like 10 hours studying per listening quiz and there were 3 of them, so that was really tough. Love the course, but it was a little intimidating coming in with no music knowledge, being surrounded by people who already knew a lot, and feeling pretty lost. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Genuinely engaging material\r\n- Fantastic teaching staff (including TAs)\r\n- Great section planning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Examinations are not reflective of the course material (in the slightest). Even after studying for hours and drafting a 30-page study guide, I was unpleasantly surprised that I was required to know the origins and details of obscure artists (rather than thematic trends in rock 'n' roll, major artist histories, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths, if there are any, are the TA guided sections that focused on stories from a specific group or genre. The professor was abysmal, not engaging, and failed to ever provide context or insight for what he was \"teaching.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course was really engaging at times. I was interested in the content of the lectures and sections because rock music is something almost everyone at least has a basic knowledge of, so learning more context and specificity was interesting. Professor Harrison obviously knows a ton, so it was fun to just hear him share trivia and facts. The main weakness with this class was the exams. I felt like I had learned a LOT from this class - specific facts, historical context for rock music, and I was able to fit genres and people into a larger arc of The History of Rock as a whole. But the exams were extremely discouraging for me. The amount of knowledge I feel like I gained was not at all represented in my test scores. The midterm was entirely very-specific multiple choice and matching about extremely minute details. And the final was mostly like that as well - although slightly less so with the essay portion which was more open-ended. I think a large portion of the class expressed their frustration with the midterm, and Professor Harrison responded to the feedback making the final exam a little less cruel. But overall, I don't think the assessments (exams, essays, etc) really were able to showcase the amount I learned from the class. I know this is probably not what most people would want, but I feel like I could have synthesized my knowledge from this course better in a final essay rather than a long final exam. Perhaps having a few shorter exams throughout the semester, and one or two essays would be helpful. I know that the students who took the class came from a huge range of backgrounds where some are more used to taking tests and some are more used to writing essays. (I'm the latter.) So maybe giving everyone a chance to actually prove their breadth/depth of knowledge would be beneficial to both the students and the professor/TAs. ",
            "\u00a0This course has very interesting material, and it is fun to focus on music and get to listen to so much music. However, Professor Harrison, as nice of a person he is, does not know how to test students. He seems to assume that everyone has the same encyclopedic knowledge of rock music since 1950 that he has, and creates his tests under this assumption. Therefore, the tests are essentially impossible, and you will come out of them knowing that you had no chance to answer the questions unless you came into the class already knowing the information. If you are already a history of rock buff, then you will be great. If you are not, the tests will be extremely difficult, but the class will still be enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs were awesome and I loved Professor Harrison, but most students taking the course agreed that the way we were tested was absurd. There should be bigger thematic papers (e.g. the existing 500 word one plus two 5+ pagers) that encourage students to think about the big picture. Even if we try to memorize so many facts about artists producers and cities of origin for a test, were bound to forget them within days. Understanding broader concepts guarantees a lasting impact. Also, we should talk more about what rock is and isnt  particularly the random songs on the listening quizzes should be qualified. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be greatly improved. I was disappointed to see that so much of the exams were based off of seemingly random facts from the readings. I wish that the goals of the course were clearer so that when I was studying I felt like I knew what to study rather than trying to randomly memorize information. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm was way too granular in its focus. I read the entire book back-to-back and still didn't know a good portion of what was on that test. I can't imagine how difficult it would have been for someone with zero prior knowledge of any of this material to remember all of that. The hardest thing was knowing what to study. This was improved upon for the final when Harrison sent out a very helpful message with advice on studying for each section of the final.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are really fantastic, however. Harrison's passion is evident in every class and he knows the story of rock history through and through. I love that he looks at it from a music theorist's perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: very good intto to the course; background of Rock and roll in jazz and R&B, good unit of first wave fo Rock and Roll (Buddy Holly, Elvis, Chuck Berry), good unit on British Invasion, but too much emphasis on Beatles in this section. (Yes they need to be a big part of this, but I feel like a lot of other bands of this era got glossed over)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The title is very misleading. I expected to learn about rock and roll and rock music throughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s. They tried to fit too much in and got very off topic. I believe if this was truly a history of rock course, then they should largely cut out the soul/Motown, disco, and rap/hip-hop units. These took up very significant amounts of time in the course, and while they are important and influenced rock, they should have been far more peripheral (ie two lectures on Motown, 1 on disco, 1 or 2 on rise of rap/hip-hop) instead of full units (several textbook chapters worth).\r\n\r\nMany bands were not mentioned at all or where only mentioned very briefly (Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozzy Osbourne, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Genesis, Phil Collins, Def Leppard, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Metallica, Bob Dylan, Boston, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Peter Gabriel, Heart, U2, The Police, Bruce Springsteen, Mtley Cre, the Rolling Stones). Base don how this course is presented, I expected (and greatly would have preferred)  to learn about these in depth rather than the likes of Donna Summer/Disco and many Motown artists. \r\n\r\nThe course gets very pread out as it progresses. As you leave the 60s, the lectures no longer match up with what you elarn with sections and neither of those really match what you're supposed to be reading in the textbook. I think this would be helped by streamlining the course down to just the 50s through the 80s so you can go more in depth into the golden age of rock. Further, as we got into the 90s and 2000s I feel we really lost \"rock\" as people think of it considering we had Taylor Swift and Dr. Dre on out listening quizzes. \r\n\r\nThe other big flaw of the course are the exams. The focused almost exclusively on tiny, random facts rather than broad themes. In a course like this is ti completely unreasonable to be asking which studio bands played in which cities, or who produced a band during a specific 5-year stretch. The textbook is several pages, which gives tens of thousands of possible little facts to have to memorize. This really took away from the greater themes and trends of rock music we learned in the course.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if the course is to remain unchanged (which it really shouldn't, there's a lot to be worked on) it needs to be renamed to something along the lines of \"American Music of the 20th Century\" ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of miscellaneous facts that were very difficult to retain for the tests in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty white-washed version of history and exams did not test the material being taught; very obscure fact checking matching questions that were almost impossible to actually study for. ",
            "\u00a0The listening quizzes were definitely a strength, as they helped introduce me to new music and focus on unique elements in the songs. The lectures and sections were also well organized and interesting. The midterm and final were weak points of the class, as the matching parts often referenced bands and/or albums that we never covered in class and were only briefly mentioned in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The exams asked for asinine regurgitation of extremely specific, esoteric factual data. The preparation advice we were given was essentially \"memorize the entire textbook.\" ",
            "\u00a0strengths-Lectures were engaging and interesting, discussion sections were very helpful, teaching from professor and TA's was very good\r\nweaknesses- the class focused more on popstars and pop groups than anticipated, didn't get to cover other artists in depth (like Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Talking Heads etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I never came away from lecture feeling like I really learned anything interesting.  The timeliners often felt forced and useless.  If this is a history class, it should be focused on stories, themes, and trends.  Changes in musical form can be a part of that, but it didn't feel like that was how the timeliner was used. ",
            "\u00a0Exams were not fair assessments of course material ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was interesting and allowed for you to discover various types of music and gain a respect for songs that you may not normally listen to. It was a low-work load which allowed you to enjoy focusing on just the reading for the course. I think that there could be some improvements to the course though. For instance, I believe lectures could cover more material relevant to exams. This includes the material from our textbook which contained a lot of information that wasn't usually discussed in lecture. The professor tended to lecture about information during the time period but not necessarily something useful for the exams. The majority of the studying for exams was based on reading the textbook throughly and memorizing information so this should have been a greater focus on exams and in discussion sections. Discussion sections thus could have been improved as well to cater to relevant information on exams and prepare us for the memorization-type format section of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were much too difficult. They required fact recollection from a very large textbook. This does not seem useful. ",
            "\u00a0It was very poorly structured - the material taught in class was not at all what we were examined on. The class had the potential to be fun and interesting, but fell short. ",
            "\u00a0The course exams are almost completely memorization based, since there is so much information about artists, producers, etc. to learn. I think that maybe a final paper instead of an exam where you just memorize artist information might be a better assessment.\r\n\r\nI also think there were many artists that did not get discussed or receive enough focus, but I recognize there is so much to talk about that some artists are going to be abbreviated. ",
            "\u00a0Great information on the major musical and social movements in the second half of the 20th century. Could maybe be a little more focused on rock, or advertise itself as a broader \"pop\" course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and sections are super fun. I also loved listening to the playlists. The reading and assessments were terrible though  the expectations for ,e,prizing information are totally unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the music! this class had us listen to a lot of great music, and I enjoyed learning different features of the songs that allow them to create the feelings and effects that they do. I also found the effect of artists on each other as well as their effect of history on the music of the time fascinating. I particularly enjoyed our album listening from section. Dan Harrison was also an engaging lecturer and I enjoyed attending class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- There are two main weaknesses to this class. The first was the midterm (and part of the final) exam that expected us to know minute details from the textbook that were never mentioned in class. Professor Harrison defended his exam saying that you have to know the facts to know the history, but saying any fact in a 500 page textbook is fair game is crazy, and also the kind of information people will memorize for the test and forget 3 days later. Instead, I would recommend having an instructor provided terms list that students are responsible for knowing, and making the midterm and final more like the essay section of the final, which clearly tested factual knowledge but also required more thinking about the connections between the facts. The second weakness of the class is how lecture diverged from major artists and songs (and the textbook, and therefore what we were tested on) in the later lectures. For example, the Rolling stones were only mentioned in passing in lecture, and we never discussed Nirvana. Instead, we spent 20 minutes of lecture listening to Wesley Willis. A few tangents from the textbook would be fine, but I would have preferred the time spent in class discussing an artist to be more proportional to their influence on rock music. ",
            "\u00a0I was kind of disappointed by the course. Lectures weren't particularly helpful, and readings were interesting but exams weren't fair at all; they mostly consisted of trivia from the readings that weren't covered in lecture. The biggest strength was that Harrison does a very good job teaching non-musicians how to listen to music more critically, which is just a useful skill to have for life. ",
            "\u00a0While the TAs for this class were excellent, Professor Harrison created assignments and study requirements that assumed expert knowledge of music and the music industry. The exams did not reflect the content of lecture and the content on the exams was extremely specific and outlandish. My TA made the class extremely enjoyable and engaging but the class itself was poorly organized. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrison was a compelling lecturer, and I felt that his lectures in approximately the first half of the courses were generally quite solid and interesting (if occasionally lightweight). I also thought that section was very useful. In general, I wished that Professor Harrison covered slightly more of the material that he expected us know in class, rather than simply having us learn it from the textbook, and tested us more broadly on theories and concepts that we covered in the class. My very favorite part was the 500-word paper on a song, and wish that we either had more of these or it was extended (perhaps a WR option with a final essay on an album of set of songs by an influential musician?), and also the albums that we listened to in section, and would have been happy if these were every week and were an integral part of the course, i.e. the homework was listening and thinking about music, and class was focused on the historical and factual details that helped us understand the music that we were listening to for music. I think that this would have better helped me really get a strong understanding of the music. A final thought is that I understand that Prof. Harrison didn't just want this class to be the big names of rock 'n' roll, but I thought that it was slightly strange that he skipped over so much incredibly important and influential acts/movements in the history of rock (e.g. the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, any mention of metal, alternative rock, glam rock) in favor of his personal interests, and I felt that either the material should be modified to be more of a \"survey\" (particularly post-1967) or the description of the class should be changed slightly to better reflect what was taught.

            "\u00a0Yes! This has been my favorite class at Yale. Professor Harrison is so knowledgeable about music and has great and interesting lectures. The way sections are planned for this class are also great because you don't need to prepare anything. You will spend most time engaging with this course through listening playlists for quizzes (which have fantastic music). Take this class if you want to expand your musical tastes and understand more about the history of popular music (not necessarily just rock). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course as a fun way to listen to and learn more about music, and more specifically Rock. ",
            "\u00a0This was easily my favorite course at Yale, and I appreciate all music so much more after having taken the class. I would highly recommend this course to any student who has just the slightest interest in music at all, because this course is more about popular music history since the 1950s than just rock music history, since all music is influenced by and influences each other. It is a very low workload course but you will learn a ton. It is a class that you will genuinely love to attend, and listening to and learning about music is such a fresh of breath air from other stressful Yale courses. There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out since it is a newer course but I anticipate this to be one of Yale's most popular courses in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be warned that the finals are not as easy as you may think. It's not a \"study the night before\" kinda test. Professor Harrison expects you to know the littlest of details. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. The class is incredibly interesting and the TA's were very engaging, but there was simply no way to properly study for the test, and the professor went rogue from the study guide he provided on both the Midterm and Final. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not sure I would recommend unless you really love music or already know a lot about it. I took the course credit/D with a lot of other coursework, so I couldn't prioritize it, and it was too much work for me to be able to even marginally get a sense of what we were learning. I wish I could have been more engaged, but it was way too much for even credit/D. I have taken course credit/D before a got a lot more out of them than this one. However, besides that, Professor Harrison is amazing and it's a super cool class - IT'S JUST A LOT OF WORK! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. History of Rock is one of my all-time favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. I am always excited to come to lecture and section, and I am genuinely excited to learn the new material. Plus, it's a gut! Best of both worlds... ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY NOT. If you want a credit/d, maybe. This course has so much potential to be really, really good, but Professor Harrison's lectures CONSISTENTLY FALL FLAT. He is not engaging and does not understand how to provide context to anything learned in the course. Definitely the worst class I've taken at Yale in 7 semesters. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that if you're taking this class purely because of your enjoyment/interest in rock music, that you take it Cr/D/Fail. It's really interesting and fun, but if I hadn't taken it Cr/D/Fail, I would have totally lost my mind studying for the exams. There is SO much information to cram into your brain and Prof. Harrison tests on extremely minute details. If you want to take it because it sounds fun, then taking it Cr/D/Fail allows you to step back a little bit and enjoy yourself rather than over-stressing about memorization and cramming. Also, don't expect to learn everything about everything. This is very much an introduction to contemporary music history, and a LOT of people/information/music is left out. I was introduced to a lot of new artists and music, but there was also a lot that I already knew that wasn't addressed. Overall, though, I had a good time and learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Be careful taking this class. It's fun, but the tests are impossible. Depending on the curve, you may or may not do well. A good Credit/D class. ",
            "\u00a0Unless Professor Harrison changes the way the information is tested, take this class Credit/D. Its super cool to learn about music, and I especially loved watching old videos, e.g. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan and the first episode of MTV. Studying for the listening quizzes is fun. As is, the exams require tons of rote memorization, so its much more enjoyable to take it Credit/D and not have to bother with all the details. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student as long as they were committed to doing all the readings and knew an important part of this course was rote memorization. In order to do well in this class you need a huge capacity for reading comprehension and memorization upon a first read. ",
            "\u00a0yes and no. Be aware it is not exactly as it is presented to be (misleading title) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend this course strictly to those who are interested and passionate about musical studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a very good course for anyone who wants an introductory music class. However, if they are not interested in rock at all, listening to the playlists may be hard. ",
            "\u00a0Wait to take this until the exams are sorted out. Otherwise, a very cool class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. Im glad I am now able to listen to music in a more critical way, but we had to know so many minuscule and unrealistic details that made exams impossible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, knowing about the general history of pop music is something we should all know and appreciate and this course opens your eyes to artists/songs you've potentially never heard before ",
            "\u00a0This class sucks.  It would be fine if it weren't called a history class, but I think a lot of people were duped into thinking that the class would be about people, events, themes, etc.  That was part of the class, but it was poorly organized and I never felt like I got much out of lectures.  Instead, there was a weird amount of musical analysis and lectures were scattered.  This class wasn't all bad, but I do feel like it was largely a waste of time.  Lectures probably had 1/3 of the class going by the end of the semester, if that's any indicator.  My TF, Bronwen, was fantastic though, which helped a lot.  Section was always interesting, even after I stopped regularly attending lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Unless the course changed its curriculum, I would not recommend this to another student ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in rock music takes this class. Good credit/d but also not a bad letter grade class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have an interest in rock music or the development of American music throughout the 20th century, then this course may be very interesting for you. The only real homework in this class was reading the chapter(s) for the lectures each week and studying the for the three listening quizzes which were on Spotify. Luckily in my section we hardly had any preparation at all so all I had to do was study for the midterm and final exams. Of course, the midterm and final exams were designed as mostly memorization-type exams and sorting musical albums or artists with their corresponding artists or locations. It became a pain to study for these tests due to the lack of resources other than the textbook. Most students felt the same though so the curve kept the test fairly balanced. By taking this course, I gained an appreciation for various types of music and have come to love some older songs ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class, but only if the difficulty of the midterms and the final is made more reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. It was not at all as interesting as I thought it would be. ",
            "\u00a0It is a pretty easy course, but exams are heavily based on just memorizing information. The class material is really cool and fun stuff, but I did not enjoy the way the class was taught and thought that it did not touch on a lot of info. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It really contextualized my love of rock music and gave me more knowledge of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking the class but only credit d or if you are willing to do some work for it. If you make any kind of effort, the curve is so big that youll be fine. If you arent willing to put time towards the class though, you should only take it credit/d. I do think it totally changed how I interact with music and I learned a ton  and had fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but take it credit-D (as I did)  if the testing format doesn't change. I enjoyed attending this class and the listening HW was fun, but if I was trying to get an A on the fact based midterm and portion of the final I would have needed to put in an extra 30+ hours of studying. ",
            "\u00a0It was just the second year the course was offered, so hopefully it keeps improving. Definitely DO NOT take it as a gut; a lot of the final was designed to reward people who had been to lecture and punish those who hadn't (which was fine with me, but worth noting). The class will challenge a lot of preconceived notions you have about what rock music is, and does get into some cool social history, which is cool, but only take it if you really think you'll be invested in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I probably wouldn't, except perhaps for a student with little to no background knowledge in 20th century popular music looking for a relatively relaxed class. Lectures were fun, and we got to listen to a lot of cool music and even write a short essay about a song that we liked. However, I felt slightly disappointed because I am very interested in the subject and felt that what we learned, particularly in the latter half, was more of a history of the music industry than of rock - we more or less only focused on singles that reached the Billboard Hot 100, and measured songs primarily based on how much money they made at the time rather than how enduring or influential they have been. In the end, this gave an effect that Prof. Harrison really wasn't willing to see rock music (along with related genres such as blues, funk, soul, disco, and rap) as anything more than a commercial product, and did not take any of the movements seriously based on their artistic merit. For students interested in learning about groups such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, the Who, Pink Floyd, Queen, AC/DC, Metallica, or Nirvana, this class is not for you, because none of these artists were ever mentioned. We talked more about forgotten pop singers, ironic music, and small-time bands that came out of Yale. These are valid subjects of inquiry, and could be interesting, so I would recommend this class to students who want to learn more about this kind of information, but not so much to those interested in the \"history of rock\" that one might expect based on the title. ",
            "\u00a0This might be my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. The lectures are so fun and the homework is literally just listening to great music. There are readings that you need to do to perform well on the midterm/final, but I just did all of them the night before each exam and it only took 3-4 hours each time, so it isn't a lot of time commitment. The professor and TAs were all very fun and extremely passionate about the class. I really looked forward to the lectures and especially to section each week; I'm actually sad that I won't be in this class anymore. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to anyone interested in media studies. The content of this course not only covered us on the specific songs and bands that were prominent throughout rock history but went over why some kinds of music became widely recognized while others didn't, and part of this is largely related to the kinds of media platforms available at the each point in history (think radio waves or television). I found this aspect of the course material especially eye opening because I hadn't been anticipating it at the beginning of the semester, and I want to share this experience with fellow students. "
