            "\u00a0How to write an argumentative essay using different lens of authors and analyze their arguments to synthesize your own ",
            "\u00a0I learned more than I could have ever expected. I came in thinking this was a class for animal psychology, but I left understanding more cultural and ethical implications of human-animal relationships. Not to mention, I feel like a much better writer. I have learned methods in understanding how to communicate more effectively to readers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop a debatable argument and back it up with evidence and counterexamples, how to make my writing more clear and concise, and how to effectively revise an essay. I also learned how to read more complex academic texts from a wide variety of disciplines. Also, I learned quite a lot about animals and our relationship with them! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very good at advancing college-level writing skills while teaching the information pertinent to the course.  The biggest few takeaways from the course are how to properly write an essay (sentence structure, flow, tone), how to identify the nuances of good writing, how to be detached from a piece of work/have the ability to completely redraft if needed, and how to analyze a paper through the lens of another paper.  This course also brought to light the viewpoints and treatment of animals throughout history as I was opened to numerous ways on how to perceive animals and how they are treated in modern society. ",
            "\u00a0I specifically learned a lot about using one source as a lens through which to view other sources which has improved the soundness of my claims greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write confidently and how to develop a pointed (yet nuanced) argument. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned to truly approach the writing process as a process. Before taking this class, I always saw writing as a kind of one and done in terms of drafting. However, I learned that to be a truly impactful writer you must be a good revisor of your own work and others. I feel that taking English 114 didn't really change much in terms of how I write, but rather taught me to approach literature and my own writing as a collective effort. ",
            "\u00a0The fundamentals of university writing, and a better grasp on interpreting and analyzing academic writings, popular writings, and film. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a college level essay and construct a solid claim that is backed by strong evidence. "

            "\u00a0The instructor conferences were minimal, and too much time was devoted to readings and not enough to actual writing workshops ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was Professor Brown himself and the crazy cool readings. I think it could be improved with student feedback. English 114 makes students read their peers work and then edit together, but sometimes students didn't give ample advice. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course! I thought the discussions on the readings (and the readings themselves) were really engaging and this course's content was really fascinating. Also, the clear feedback on our essays was super helpful and I feel that my writing improved a lot over the semester. Because the topic is so broad and you have some freedom when choosing essay topics, it was really great to be able to write about something that is actually interesting to you. Sometimes, the readings were a bit dense, but I think that's to be expected (being challenged by these readings really improved my critical thinking skills!), and they were always manageable. Overall, it is a super engaging course! ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved if there was a little more time between paper 3 and paper 4 so students can put more effort into developing their ideas and first drafts for the fourth paper instead of rushing a certain topic to meet a deadline. ",
            "\u00a0I think generally the course is very strong, though some of the readings felt a bit excessive. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was very strong. He was very understanding and I met with him multiple times throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely Professor Brown's willingness to hear students share all interpretations of readings as well as providing insightful feedback in the drafting process. I think that a weakness of the course was the general lack of emphasize that the reading we covered were more for recognizing how writers approached writing not really what they are saying. In a sense, I approached all of the semester's reading from the idea of attempting to understand the main idea/general concept of a piece of literature, when the focus of the 114 class was to analyzing how a writing technique was effectively employed. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-organized, and allow students to really practice and get feedbacks on different types of university writings. It's an engaging and helpful course, but I wish we could spend more time on learning specific strategies to improve writings than on reading discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun and engaging as well as interesting. I learned a lot and loved the small class size. "

            "\u00a0Yes! English 114 is wonderful to get your feet on the ground with college writing expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was really engaging, it definitely challenges you to think differently about familiar subjects, and you learn a lot about writing and about animals. I think the course content is relevant to pretty much everyone, and you have a lot of freedom to pick pretty niche topics relating to animals that you are interested in. I have grown a lot as a writer and now feel much more prepared to take future writing-heavy courses here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course material alone was very enjoyable especially for someone with an interest in animals/the human-animal relationship.  For someone looking to improve their writing this course is also highly beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course will improve writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! It's a lot of work, but if you put the work in, you should be fine. ",
            "\u00a0As a first year taking their first English course, I highly recommend English 114 over 120. For shopping period, I shopped 5 English class (3 of them were 114). I chose to take this section with Professor Andrew Brown because from the first class, I thought that he would make sure that the course content was thoroughly engaging along with provide insightful feedback in my writing beyond the surface level of a good claim. Over the course of the semester he really challenged students to explore their writing and I am very grateful to have been able to take this course with him. Also the topic: Animals, animality, and the human is so niche but actually very relevant and present in tons of literary works. 12/10 recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're worried about writing in college, this is a great course to help you get started on it and receive helpful feedbacks for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly interesting topic that is not normally associated with an English course. "
