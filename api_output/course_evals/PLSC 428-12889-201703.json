            "\u00a0I learnt about the status of welfare states in developing countries, a subject that I knew little about when I began taking the class. I appreciate the variety of countries we looked at. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different types of welfare regimes, specifically those found in the Global South; how to differentiate between different welfare policies (e.g. social insurance, social assistance, etc.); and the political, economic, and social rationales for the different regimes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how welfare policies in various parts of the world (e.g. Latin America vs India vs Africa vs Middle East) differ in terms of coverage and scope of services. I developed skills in reading about specific policies and the histories behind the policies. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course I knew nothing about the global south and welfare (or even really the economies or politics) of many countries we studied.  I learned a lot from this course, especially about Latin America. "

            "\u00a0It's well organized and Professor Seekings is very passionate about his subject. More emphasis on data analysis, perhaps through a practical regression experiment would be useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting syllabus, great independence with the midterm and final papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussions were not great, some weeks felt like just repeats of the previous week. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the professor. He was very knowledgable about each country and guided a good discussion in class between the students. The weakness of the course was perhaps some of the more technical parts of the class: for instance, some students knew what a multivariable regression model was and some did not. We had to spend some class time looking over these things. I believe I would have preferred to not go over the more technical aspects and kept the prerequisite requirements as they were. "

            "\u00a0Yes- it's a must take for anyone interested in international relations/development! ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if you want to learn more about the Global South, the developing world, and sustainable ways of improving socioeconomic conditions in different regions according to their cultural, historical, and political contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is highly specialized in the material it covers, so the readings are quite specific to certain countries. If someone is interested in the more detailed aspects of welfare programs, this is the course for that person! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was super interesting and informative.  There was a lot of reading but it was mostly interesting and gone through in class.  I took this with more of a background in US politics and great interest in US welfare.  This class filled a large gap in my knowledge of the developing world. "
