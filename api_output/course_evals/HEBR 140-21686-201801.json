            "\u00a0Focus on passive grammatical structures of all tenses, familiarization with Israeli culture and media, and a good amount of vocabulary, mostly very helpful function-words and we'd build up our content-word vocabulary almost as a side effect. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an in depth look at Hebrew Grammar.  Better writing skills. Fewer speaking skills than in other Hebrew classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking, reading, writing in Hebrew language. Thorough understanding of grammar and vocabulary. Connections of modern Hebrew language to contemporary and historical culture. "

            "\u00a0Close and helpful student-teacher interactions, well designed and executed syllabus to optimize our learning. Good balance of reading, listening, speaking, and writing skill practices. The homework was very reasonable and seldom felt like busywork. Quizzes and exams were also well written and fairly graded. Would definitely recommend the course to someone looking to master their understanding of Hebrew. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nStrong teaching\r\nClear sense of content that is important to know\r\nFair assessments\r\nAmazing TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nLots of content\r\nNot as much speaking\r\nSometimes assignments feel unnecessary "
