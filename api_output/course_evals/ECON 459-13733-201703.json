            "\u00a0Presentation skills. Philipp offered invaluable advice for creating PPT. content and presenting simply. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we discussed key works in behavioral economics. The main theme of the course was the time-inconsistent behavioral model that allows for present-bias, and throughout the semester, we discussed many of the far-reaching implications of this model. The class was oriented towards academia, and we spent a lot of time discussing the implications, strengths, and weaknesses of papers in the field. At the same time, the class had substantial real-world applicability, and I left the course with a new perspective on my own behavior that has been very insightful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I wrote my first referee reports in this class, which was a valuable exercise.  I also prepared a 30-45 minute presentation on a paper of my choosing and designed an experiment for my final paper. Philipp also took the time to give us each personal feedback for our presentations, which was very helpful. All things considered, these assignments were enjoyable and helped me gain a better understanding of both theoretical and empirical research in the field. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Philipp did a great job opening up the course with presentations about the principles of behavioral economics and time-inconsistency; the foundation we developed in the first few weeks was extremely useful for the rest of the semester.\r\n2. Student-led presentations were an excellent structure for the course. I learned a lot from my peers and greatly enjoyed the open conversations that we had after presentations where we discussed the strengths, weaknesses, implications, and extensions of each paper. I also really appreciated the feedback Philipp gave me on my presentation; his tips will undoubtedly prove valuable in both professional and academic contexts.\r\n3. The small size gave the class a personal, relaxed feel that facilitated learning. It also helped that all the students in the class seemed genuinely interested in the material.\r\n4. There was a lot of flexibility built into the course that allowed students to choose topics that interested them and choose presentation dates that were convenient for our schedules.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses come to mind.

            "\u00a0Yes. A really great seminar. It is a shame Philipp will be back at Berkley next semester! ",
            "\u00a0I would very strongly recommend this course to another student. It is an extremely relaxed, enjoyable, and informative course. During the semester, I gained a fairly thorough introduction to key academic works in behavioral economics, improved my skills in critically evaluating and discussing papers, and gained valuable experience presenting on a paper of my choosing, for which I received helpful feedback from the professor. I also designed an experiment for my final paper, which was a productive experience as well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the course for me was the flexibility. In particular, we were able to freely choose papers to write about and present, and we were given substantial freedom to pursue topics of our own interest for the final paper. There was also flexibility in scheduling. For example, I was very busy at the beginning of the semester with job applications and was fortunate enough to be able to choose a date towards the end of the semester for my presentation when I had more free time. In general, the class was very engaging without imposing any kind of excessive burden on my time.\r\n\r\nPhilipp is an excellent professor who is very knowledgeable about the field and skilled in explaining the content. There was a range of prior experience with behavioral economics among the students in the class, and I felt like no one was really left behind or bored by the content. \r\n\r\nI really have nothing negative to say about this course.
