            "\u00a0I developed a great initial understanding of statistical analysis that I can apply to future endeavors. Additionally, I now know the basics of R, which I can continue to practice and build upon. From the first portion of the class I also used Minitab, although I feel like this is less practical for everyday use. After this class, I feel like I can use what I learned for future projects and research. ",
            "\u00a0I got a very thorough introduction to statistics, and now I feel as if I have a good basic understanding of fundamental techniques of statistical analysis. I got lots of opportunities to practice applying the principles on homework and feel like I gained knowledge I can use in the future to analyze research data. ",
            "\u00a0A new way of thinking and how to code in R ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use r and statistical analysis. I also learned real life applications of the material ",
            "\u00a0A more solid understanding of statistical principles and analytical techniques appropriate for research in the life sciences (especially relating to ecology). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use ANOVA and regression analysis on a variety of biologically relevant data sets. I also received an excellent introduction to R programming for statistical tests. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the second half of the course, the life sciences portion. The lectures were very engaging and straightforward with helpful examples to aide in my understanding. Also, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to learn R, which I know will be a useful skill for the future. Admittedly, the first half could have been better. The lectures were not very engaging for me, and while I like the professor, I feel like we jumped around the point a lot and that the examples were not as interesting and helpful as they could have been. Also, I was very annoyed with the grading of the problem sets because I worked really hard and followed the guidelines closely, but lost a lot of points for \"not showing enough work\" despite including all of my calculations. It is frustrating to get a low grade when all of my answers are correct, especially when I worked really hard and utilized class resources such as office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Even though there was a lot of material and we had to go quickly, I never felt overburdened by the course load. I was happy to learn as much as possible, and I think the way the subjects in the course were ordered flowed well. The material was very digestible despite the abundance of material. I also thought the homeworks were very helpful in allowing us to apply concepts to practical scenarios and analyze real data. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the second half had smaller office hours ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was fine, and helped me learn the material adequately. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course, which was set in a large lecture hall, often felt impersonal. During the second half of the semester, my section was much smaller and it was easier to cultivate a relationship with both the professor and TF. I think that if both halves of the class were taught in smaller sections, the course would feel more accessible to students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the fascinating biological applications of the statistical concepts we learned, the professor's enthusiasm and knowledge about the material, and the DataCamp website exercises for R programming. The weakness of this course is that it is too short to delve in-depth into higher level statistical concepts and also into R programming. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially the Life Sciences section! Although the class description was a bit misleading (the topics are mostly ecology-based; we did not cover topics like genetics or epidemiology as promised), it turned out to not matter because I thought the information learned was generally applicable and very practical. Unlike other sections, we learn R, which is extremely useful to know, and was taught in a way that was not overwhelming. I thought the lectures of the second half were far more interesting and engaging than the first half. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wants a really comprehensive introduction to statistics because that is what this course delivers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0If you are genuinely considering a career in scientific research, knowing statistics is a must so you should definitely take a class. I was able to understand my lab meeting presentations much better after this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as an introductory course in basic statistical methods. If you have already taken AP Statistics, there will probably be a lot of review. The course is well-organized and all information is presented clearly, though fast-paced. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about ecological applications of statistics and R programming. "
