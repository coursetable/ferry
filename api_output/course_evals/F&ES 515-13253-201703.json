            "\u00a0A) Chemistry is really hard\r\nB) But I learned a lot of the basic principles of the hydrosphere and atmosphere, which is what I wanted! ",
            "\u00a0This course is an EXCELLENT intro to environmental chem and earth systems science. It was challenging and required discipline but I'm able to apply all the skills to management work and even better understand and articulating all the implications of climate change ",
            "\u00a0I gained an array of basic knowledge on environmental physical processes. This course was information overload, but it was presented so that you were seeing the material more than once each session. ",
            "\u00a0Many, perhaps too many to fairly gather up in the context of a procedural course evaluation on winter break (which one only wants to get over with ASAP). Apart from the wholeness of the apprehension of physical sciences with a focus on environmental management problems, I thoroughly enjoyed being exposed again to environmental chemistry and basic concepts within chemistry. Although I feel I didn't exceed myself in my practical grasp of these concepts, I do feel I know understand more and can even read into charts and graphs that I would previously skip form scientific papers and articles. After all, these are dynamics I will not personally tackle (I would turn to professionals formally trained in them), but the course did prepare me to precisely engage with these experts and to know their basic lingo and what is going on in the field and in the lab. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the earth-sciences lessons of the course helped me gather many concepts that had previously been disconnected or fragmented in my head into a one coherent world view. This makes me very happy as if opened up a world of knowledge in books I already had and which I can now understand even better. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a broad and nuanced understanding of the earth system and its various components. I learned about key concepts, calculations, and various resources available to environmental managers. ",
            "\u00a0This course has made me more confident in my understanding of physical science concepts as an environmental manager. ",
            "\u00a0This is without a doubt the best class I've taken so far. I learned how to understand nature's complex systems and feedback loops. I feel more confident about the quantitative skills that we developed with the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the physical processes that occur in the environment and about how human activity affects these phenomena ",
            "\u00a0I learned the very basics of environmental science. \r\n\r\nI learned how to better understand IPCC and other scientific reports. ",
            "\u00a0I gained fundamental scientific knowledge about Water and Soil chemistry, which were both new to me. I had covered some of the atmospheric teachings in the past. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi follows through on teaching the objectives of the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about soils, water, air, and climate change. ",
            "\u00a0A much-needed introduction to and exploration of the bio-physical drivers of environmental processes and management concerns that are relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great refresher course and so useful for everyday life too! I enjoyed all case studies used to explain the topics of soil, water and atmospheric sciences. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic science relating to water, air, and soil, including climate change. I know have an understanding of some of the basic soil types, the indicators of water quality, basis geology, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the short and long term drivers of climate change. Examples (US and international) were used throughout the course.  At the end of the course, we also examined some case studies of complex environmental issues including food and climate change, desertification and arsenic poisoning. As regards skills, I know the basic units relating to many of those issues and can perform basic calculations in those areas. I also know have a greater understanding of the causes of seasonal variation and a basic understanding of weather systems. ",

            "\u00a0Very well ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I didnt think I would learn as much as I did, but Shimi is the BEST teacher I've had at Yale by far. This course exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0They greatly exceeded my expectations. Apart from the vast amount of material the course attempts to cover (and in many ways does so effectively, which exceeds expectations by itself), there are additional skills to be learnt by students in respect to self-organization and developing abilities to tackle a significant workload within the very specific lesson/class/problem set rhythm in which the course is offered. These are learn-or-perish kind of survival skills however and it would've been good to know a bit more about this respect from the beginning (in the sense that, \"there is a structure and a flow to it, the sooner you figure it out the better and here's how to do it\"). So, there is that learning curve to the course dynamics itself and it can be a bit steep for slow learners like myself. \r\n\r\nAnother way in which the course exceeded my expectations was in the way the professor artfully merged current and recent environmental challenges worldwide into the course lessons. This was very surprising and a delight to engage with also. The use of video and external sources in general--especially data websites and such--was VERY effective also and equally exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I expected this class to provide a foundation for future courses at FES. I have already applied knowledge and skills from this class to my other courses and extracurricular projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course exceeded my expectations by offering consistent challenges and opportunities for demonstrating my comprehension of scientific concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The class exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0They exceeded my expectation, I learned a lot from the class and would recommend it to first year students ",
            "\u00a0More than expected. ",
            "\u00a0It was better than expected - I thought the content was well taught and I gained a lot from the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I got what I expected and more. ",
            "\u00a0Very well ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well. I undertook this course to build my foundation in environmental science and it was the most rewarding course this semester. I now have a basis for delving further into science-based study/research if I wish to, and in the very least I have a MUCH better appreciation of some of the factors driving those environmental issues that I'm most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0It was spot on! ",
            "\u00a0I wanted a good grounding in the science relating to water, air and soil quality, and the patterns of physical systems including the carbon and nitrogen cycles and the weather system.  This is exactly what I received from this course.  I was taught many things that I did not know that I needed to know but now am very glad that I do know them! ",
            "\u00a0The general understands of physical science and details for each topics. ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectation- an amazing overview of a diverse set of scientific topics. ",
            "\u00a0Very much. I was expecting an introductory-course level and that's what it is ",
            "\u00a0Shimi set out very clear expectations throughout this class--I knew exactly what I was getting in to from the beginning and learned exactly what I expected to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Very well "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I like the overall pedagogy and balance of assignment types, four exams for 12.5% each, and clicker questions. However, this class moves along really quickly, so there's not a lot of time to absorb all the new terms and equations, particularly regarding the chemistry. That makes those portions of the exams (and other assignments, but especially the exams) tough for those without much of a scientific background. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only weakness was the time. I would've liked for it to be earlier in the day because by 4pm students are winding down and this class requires undivided attention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - different ways to learn the material \r\nWeaknesses - great detail with some concepts that may not need detail ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is the wonderfully structured way in which the vast amount of topics covered are ordered in comprehensive lesson units for the students. It is something to be missed after the course. The professor's use of Canvas is simply the best I've seen for now and the video lessons were a delight to engage with (I often went back to them just for the love of it). Once a student gets used to the course dynamics, it is simply a delight to follow in the lessons, classes and problem sets. \r\n\r\nThere is so much seen in this course that I would actually split it in two, maybe a basics for foundational purposes, and a second, more in-depth version for those who want more. Maybe. \r\n\r\nNot seeing chemistry or scientific math since my high school, the strong math component was something I struggled with throughout the course. What I was effectively able to review and revisit (relearn?) often saw itself opaqued by the making room for the next new lessons. It can be overwhelming and you have to love physical sciences in order to endure the beating. I can't imagine myself taking this course without actually loving what we were seeing in it.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that may be improved is the nature of some questions, particularly in the quizzes. Some of them come across as trick questions, which are OK I guess, but they can get to be incredibly frustrating for students struggling to merely keep up-to-date with everything. Questions should focus on reading and lesson comprehension, not on very esoteric interpretations of things you are just starting to learn or venture into in more depth. I didn't particularly hated them, it's just that they could be a bit discouraging.    \r\n\r\nAnother way in which the course could be improved is by using better imaging. This is an overall problem to science communication, but many visualizations and videos were simply not good enough, while a few were absolutely excellent in illustrating lessons. Again, the professor goes to great lengths to gather so much material together that this is just a tiny improvement to an already mammoth amount of work he puts together. Truly amazing and award-deserving. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well organized and the material is easy to follow. Concepts are reinforced with various methods on Canvas and in class. I liked that it is a flipped class so we can easily ask questions while working on problem sets. The test preparation materials are great and combined concepts in a way that enhanced my understanding of each topic. ",
            "\u00a0The course requires a lot of work, but this supports students' comprehension of the concepts and provides several opportunities to build your grade. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely Shimi's engagement with the students. His willingness to explain topics over and over and again. His passion for teaching was what encouraged us to understand even the most complex topics. I think there are no weaknesses, but if I could point out one it would be the quizzes, sometimes I felt that the questions were going one step further than what we learned. I think that some questions were very tricky and that they could be simpler just to evaluate our knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0The course doesn't have any weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Shimmy is a wonderfully engaged teacher who dedicates a lot of hours and efforts on his student. He is very empathetic as well.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the course is designed to facilitate learning and reinforce the same key ideas again and again.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of anything I would asked to be done better. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is the most accessible and approachable professor that I've ever had. He helps students at every step of the way. I wish we had spent more time on water chemistry versus atmospheric chemistry, but I have to state that I am biased because water was a new subject for me. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive course. Great topic introductions, especially for those who were never inducted to the sciences to any significant degree. No weaknesses that I can think of. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well structured and implemented. Nothing should change. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course, found it valuable, and liked the flipped classroom. My only suggestion for improvement is to please figure out a way for problem sets on Canvas to only return incorrect questions rather than require re-entering every answer! ",
            "\u00a0This course has many strengths. It is extremely well-organised and keeps students engaged through online lectures (followed by readings and a quiz) and then actual lectures followed by problem sets.  This course works very well as a flipped course.  I really appreciated that the lectures that the instructor gave in person were based on the issues that students had found difficult in the online quizzes, rather than students directly having to ask him questions (when they may be unaware of what they do not know). I also appreciated the opportunity to do the homework at the end of class and ask any questions that I might have. This course has no obvious weakness. If possible, it would have been cool to do some sort of field trip. ",
            "\u00a0I really developed my skills in comprehensive understandings of physical science and the way of scientific logic. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses- \r\n\r\nStrengths- great teaching, curriculum, mix of group work and independent study. \r\n\r\nAn excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Everything is arranged in a way so that students learn. The environment created by Shimi and his TA's is very conducive to understand the fundamentals of earth's processes. \r\nA field trip would be the cherry on top of the cake! ",
            "\u00a0The structure of this class is great! I enjoyed the flipped class style and the many opportunities to check understanding and interact with the material. Is it possible to include optional (or 4-credit?) lab or field trip options, especially for the water and soil sections? "

            "\u00a0This course is an absolute must and should be taken by all students at FES regardless of their previous background. Those with an advanced knowledge of physical sciences will find it a good overall review, especially in the lessons pertaining to current or historically important environmental management challenges. Those with little or no background in these topics will find the course engaging and challenging in more than a way, but in the end the hard work and the suffering is well worth it. It is a delight of a course and the instructor is one of the best professors I've had in my life. Take this course if you can! ",
            "\u00a0Some students choose not to take this course despite not placing out with the exemption exam. I think this is a mistake. The course covers a lot of material in a short period of time that is essential for other coursework and real world applications. I highly recommend that everyone take this class their first semester. ",

The workload and assessments are intense, but are well worth the investment of time and effort. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this class if you don't have an environmental/physical science background.  I have a biology degree but found this course extremely useful. If you have done quantitative work before, then you will likely find the content straightforward but it is still interesting and useful.  This is a very well thought out class and the instructor was very enthusiastic in teaching it. ",
