            "\u00a0This semester, I had the opportunity to design and pilot my own study. I learned a lot about what goes into creating a study: the background research, the experimental design down to the smallest detail, how to randomize conditions and counterbalance, analyzing pilot results to make it better, etc. I feel I gained an extensive understanding of the scientific method in a supportive setting. Laurie's lab is full of wonderfully supportive undergrads and grad students (and of course Laurie herself!) who are all very available for help and advice. ",
            "\u00a0I became really comfortable working on a lab environment and picked up a lot of wet-lab skills. I also learned a lot about the process of designing and conducting a research project. ",
            "\u00a0I began to think deeply about senior thesis topics. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed being able to run studies and gathering data; that was the most active and engaging part of lab for me because I enjoy interacting with people. I also liked our discussions of specific studies or social psychology concepts like belonging. The lab is a really comfortable and welcoming environment, and I almost always felt like I could ask questions and contribute to discussions. I was able to participate in and experience multiple steps of the research process because I both started a new study and worked with the data for an older one. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how Psychology research is done. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great opportunity for anyone looking for research experience. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot about how psychology research is conducted, and how to talk to and run participants for studies. I also learned how to do a literature review and write it up. ",
            "\u00a0Provides great experience of what working in a lab is like. ",
            "\u00a0I furthered my knowledge of bench techniques (immunohistochemistry), and properly learned how to use the LSM 800 microscope and analyze images. ",
            "\u00a0Psych 493 truly gave me the opportunity to apply all that I have learned while pursuing my psych major. I was able to apply all the concepts I learned in research methods, while pursuing the aspects of psychology I have found most compelling It also gave me the opportunity to see how experiments were run from advertising, to scheduling participants, to running the participants, to managing the data after it has been collected. Overall, it truly gave me an insight into research psychology, and psychology outside the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about neuroscience, a field about which I previously knew very\r\nlittle. I also learned a lot about how to process image data. I found processing the fMRI\r\ndata to be most challenging. I had previously only processed data from csv files, and I\r\nrealized that processing image data is substantially more complicated. I enjoyed learning about the potential power of connectome-based predictive modeling to relate neural events to a broad range of cognitive abilities, and using my R and statistics skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of how eating disorders are diagnosed, of treatments for eating disorders and of diverse psychological approaches to understanding widespread eating behaviors. These topics have shown me the array of challenges that health professionals must face and resolve using psychological considerations in order to effectively promote nutrition. ",
            "\u00a0Research what youre interested in for credit (pass/fail); its great and flexible! ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking, quantitative research study design and implementation, data analysis ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skills necessary to design, conduct, and analyze psychological studies involving young children. I learned how to effectively execute the responsibilities of a research assistant, how to read and think critically about scientific papers, and generate ideas for how to improve existing studies or design new ones. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Research helped me gain a stronger understanding of the process of neuroscience research. I improved my skills in running rat self-administration experiments and gained insights on how to relate that data to the study of histone deacetylation. "

            "\u00a0This course was a great opportunity to begin the preliminary steps in thinking about what I wanted my thesis to center on; it was great! ",
            "\u00a0Great for research! ",
            "\u00a0Overall I really learned a lot from this class in terms of conducting research and collecting data. I wish I had a little more guidance from my advising P.I., particularly in terms of writing my final paper/beginning my senior project. Other than the final paper, I really learned a lot from working in the Lab, and really feel as I learned about all the nuances that go into research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton through this research and am grateful for the opportunity it gave me to explore my interests in neuroscience and build my analytical skills! ",
            "\u00a0I was thoroughly satisfied with this course and cannot really think of anything I would change. It allowed me to practice working on a research project with other students, to practice presenting my research in a formal presentation to other researchers, and to develop skills in writing and formatting a formal psychology research paper. There were also very informative sessions with researchers who came to lab meetings as guest speakers, along with a variety of other similar activities that provided great learning experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Can help you start mapping out your thesis or graduate school ",
            "\u00a0Directed research at Yale is well-organized and gives students the opportunity to conduct meaningful projects for their majors. ",
            "\u00a0As directed research, the main strength of the course is that it is completely hands-on and involves theoretical as well as practical application of psychology research. I cannot think of any weaknesses of the course, as I was able to work closely with researchers at every step in the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this as a 5th or 6th course. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of work, and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Make sure you find a lab that fits well with your interests! ",
            "\u00a0Great idea for anyone who wants to do research! ",
            "\u00a0If you plan to do grad school, this is a great way to get research experience without having to give up a lot of time outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to anyone interested in research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think directed research is good if you are interested in getting a BS and want to do your own research! Its also helpful if you want to get some research experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Important and fun if you think you might want to be an academic. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend Psych 493 to another student. Not only did it allow me to see how psychology can be translated into a career, but it gave me the opportunity to explore what I was truly passionate about. It also gave me the opportunity to engage closely with an amazing professor and get to know some equally amazing RA's, grad students and postdocs. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in research! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's very flexible and you really learn the ins and outs of research. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The Yale Visual Cognitive Neuroscience Lab is doing a lot of interesting work! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the psychological factors that affect eating behavior. This is very important to understand in attempting to resolve nutritional challenges in our food system and in attempting to understand and treat eating disorders. This course was very effective in beginning to expose us to a variety of innovative ideas in these topics, and it allowed us as students to begin developing our own innovative ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if youre interested in research, graduate school, or studying with a certain professor to learn more about their field of study ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take directed research before senior year, so you have a feel for the research process, and during, for your thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend PSYC 493 for any psychology major I wish I had started working in a lab earlier than my senior year, as I have learned a lot in one semester and wish I had more time to learn and prepare for my senior essay. If you have a specific passion (there are SO many different labs on campus) and want to learn the ins and outs of conducting research (an essential skill/experience no matter what you do after Yale), you should consider taking this course!
