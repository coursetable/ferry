            "\u00a0I learned how to more closely read pieces of literature. My writing ability was also challenged. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a new way of writing analytical essays that moves away from the formulaic high school format and focuses more on communicating new ideas. The process of writing has thus become a lot easier and more fun. I think I read some really cool works and am really glad to have read things like Walden and Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man with such good class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Warner's class was extremely difficult but so worth it. He challenged us as students at every step of the road from class discussions to essays and this helped build within me a much stronger set of critical thinking and writing skills. Within writing, he absolutely changed the way I approach essays. He taught me to write more succinctly and powerfully, adding punch to my analyses so that someone outside of the class would actually WANT to read my work. ",
            "\u00a0I learn to become a better writer than I had ever been before. Prof Warner pays special attention to every sentence in your paper and I cant stress enough on how incredible of a mentor he is, friendly and dedicated. ",
            "\u00a0I have grown to understand the traditions of American literary culture and learnt how to express myself more succintly. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned to approach my education from a standpoint of curiosity instead of fear. I learned to be more concerned with the material than with my grade, and I also learned how to appreciate criticism of my writing which formerly was uncomfortable for me. I also learned about what kind of literature comprises the American canon. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved greatly in this course. I was exposed to some excellent literature, and the discussion/analysis was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about essential texts in the American cannon. I learned how to better write close reading papers and how to write close readings in dialogue with a critic as well as in the context of more intensive research. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better analytical writer, I think. The class forced me to consider and confront small weaknesses in my writing, and I think by the end my argumentation and analysis of literature became much sharper. "

            "\u00a0This course was my least favorite all term, and that is saying a lot because I am an English major enroled in Intro Bio. The discussions were interesting some of the time but could have been less directed so as to facilitate more exploration of the texts by the students. I felt that the grading for the papers was a bit unfair at times as well. The professor expecting things of us that were far above the level of an intro course and gave us little direction in how to achieve what he wanted of us. ",
            "\u00a0I think the amount of reading varied a bit from week to week and it would be nicer for scheduling homework purposes if it were more consistent. I wish there had been more readings by women and women of color on the syllabus. I don't think it is ok for a professor to use the n word in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course come in its strong layout for building a foundational set of skills for anyone interested in English (or practically any subject). I think the greatest weakness of the course is that we have to fly through such unbelievable material so quickly. At times, it felt like it would have been more helpful to cut out a work from the syllabus (though I don't know what I would cut) so that we could focus more on the works we do get to examine. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course, as with most English classes at Yale, is the incredible work we're lucky enough to read. It's also a great intro class for the English major, as the writing assignments are challenging but build on each other well. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the syllabus could have included more women or POC American contributions to literature. The focus on Baldwin was also not satisfactory. I was, at first, a bit appalled by the amount of time we spent on Moby Dick but Prof Warners very queer lens for the class makes it worth it. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of the course was its focus on male writers, writing mostly about male characters. I unerstand that this makes sense historically, but out discussion of women writers (Wharton, O'Connor, Dickinson) was very short and limited. On the other hand, we spent weeks discussing only men. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that there was more inclusion of women in the literature that we read. I like the structure of the class. ",
            "\u00a0There could have been more variety/structure, but overall I really loved all that we read and discussed. The class was not high pressure and felt like a safe space to express ideas/thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that class discussion had been a little more evenly distributed throughout the classroom I felt that at times, our instructor directed conversation in such a way that minimized student contribution. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good discussions, really interesting syllabus, professor was great. Weaknesses: this is probably unavoidable in an intro/survey course, but I did wish we could have delved more deeply into some of the writers on the syllabus, while others I wish we had spent less time on (I know Moby Dick is a classic, but what a slog). I would have liked to read more Baldwin and O'Connor, and I was also really bummed we had to drop Pynchon from the syllabus. "

            "\u00a0The texts for this course are amazing, but I would only recommend taking it with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was super interesting and I think American literature is one of my favorite subjects to study. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student, prospective English major or not. Professor Warner really brings to life a strong course layout to help the students build a strong set of foundational skills which are applicable regardless of your field. ",
            "\u00a0Take the class, but only with Michael Warner. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. The literature we read was interesting, but not overwhelmingly so; the scope of the course was rather limited; and there isn't a lot of space to improve one's writing. There are weekly reading responses (but there is no critical evaluation of them) and three essays to submit over the course of the semester. You only receive meaningful feedback for one of these.\r\nI also wouldn't recommend my particular section with Professor Warner to anyone because although he is obviously a gifted academic, his relationship to the students he's teaching is quite lacking. I felt disrespected almost every single class. He kept interrupting students who contributed to the discussion, mostly the girls (!), so explaining our opinions well was very difficult. It almost seemed as if there were good and bad opinions, no matter how well explained they were -- so much that sometimes I was afraid to talk in class. Originally, I considered English to be one of my top choices for a major, but now I know that I do not want to subject myself to other courses taught in a similar style. If you need to take this class, take it with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in American literature or willing to learn more about it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The literature that you are exposed to in this course is wide ranging and exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the texts and class discussions were fascinating. I thought the assignments were well geared towards improving my critical writing skills. However, I felt that the feedback I received did not clearly direct me towards improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're an English major, or if you want a general overview of American literature. Absolutely take it with Michael Warner if you want to improve your writing. "
