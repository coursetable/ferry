            "\u00a0I developed my skills as both a reader and writer of poetry. The class is structured so you read a book of poetry each week and write a reflection on it and also write a poem. There are no prompts for the poems and you choose the book you read each week from a list of suggested poets. It's really a course that gives back what you put in. Through workshopping poems in class and hearing Prof Gluck's feedback, I feel my understanding of what makes a poem engaging really grew. Also, writing about collections of poetry immediately after reading them helped me realize more clearly what makes good poetry compelling. ",
            "\u00a0The consistent work required for this class is what made it so fruitful in the end. The requirement of producing one poem each week got me out of the habit of writing only when the inspiration strikes - and forced me to look to less familiar avenues for inspiration. The class also requires reading a book of poems each week and writing a thoughtful response to it. I think this class, more than any course or independent reading I had done in the past, made me a much more perceptive reader of poetry. It's helped me to analyze my own poetry in the same way, and has really helped with revision. Professor Gluck will not accept fluffy or surface-level prose responses, and wants you to look at your own work with the same critical lens - so even more than writing, this class has vastly improved my ability to rewrite and rework. It helped me see each poem as a work in progress. The same goes for workshopping others' work. The process of looking at another person's poem analytically helped me apply that same distance to my own. Having my own pieces workshopped helped me get over the discomfort of sharing my work and made me much more receptive to criticism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be not only a better writer of poetry, but also a better editor of my own poetry. "

            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is that the quality of workshop depends on the composition of your personal class. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class requires producing a lot of work: one poem and one prose response to a book of poetry each week. This is definitely a strength, because that productivity guarantees a mix of frighteningly bad poems and some that are worth investing more time into. I also appreciated that only three poems were workshopped per class. This allows everyone to enter the world of the poem for long enough to pinpoint what is working, what isn't, and why, and engage in some lively debate. At first I disliked that, contrary to other courses in which students may sign up or be assigned to workshop rounds, Professor Gluck simply chooses poems for workshop each week. It ended up evening out in the end, though, with everyone getting to be workshopped about the same number of times. It became very clear that she chooses poems for workshop carefully - those with strengths and weaknesses that have something bigger to teach us. By the end, I felt that was the most thoughtful way of running workshop after all. Prof Gluck was also great about encouraging everyone to participate actively and fully in workshop. It is a completely engaging (and demanding) experience. Perhaps one improvement would be a more structured way of organizing rewrites and revisions - even if Prof Gluck can't read them all, it would be great if a peer review system could be put into place. ",
            "\u00a0The course's greatest strength is the individual conferences you get to have with the professor. Its weakness is that sometimes seminar feels a bit like a lecture rather than a discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but I would recommend taking an intro level poetry writing course first if you haven't since they provide more structure, guidance and formal instruction. This course is really just a workshop space. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you're really committed to writing poetry, and are willing to put in the work, your writing will certainly improve and you'll have fun along the way! The atmosphere of the class will likely be much less relaxed than other classes (compared to, for example, 123) - but it's because Prof Gluck takes it seriously. Be prepared to receive (sometimes) harsh criticism - you will definitely know when she doesn't like something, but it's never mean and always intended toward the goal of improving. (On the flip side of that coin, you will also definitely know when she does like something - and she does not hold back from encouragement in that regard!) Even when it comes to other students, it can feel very vulnerable to have your poem workshopped for 1/3 of the class meeting time. That's all a part of the process, though - the experience is humbling and the feedback from classmates is always insightful and varied. If you have the opportunity to work one-on-one with such an accomplished writer - take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is ready for tough and serious criticism that will take his or her poetry to the next level. "
