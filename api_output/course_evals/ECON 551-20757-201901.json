The topics that I think will be most valuable that we learned were:\r\n-Panel data estimation\r\n-Bootstrapping \r\n-IV Estimation\r\n-Limited dependent variable MLE "

            "\u00a0Very good. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Fall metrics is a total whirlwind, so it is great that this course revisits some of the topics and allows students to solidify their understanding of key topics. \r\n-The textbook choice is great and problem sets are helpful with learning material and evaluating your understanding\r\n-TA sessions were fantastic for material review and clarifying some of the math behind the theorems, etc. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n-It would be great to do some more estimation/interpretation "

However, it will also be helpful for those students that decide to pursue econometrics because it is one more chance to solidify an understanding of extremum estimation, asymptotic theory, etc. before continuing on with the advanced metrics courses.
