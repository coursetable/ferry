            "\u00a0Before this class, I thought I knew how to think critically, make arguments, and write papers, but I didn't really know how to do any of those things!  \r\n\r\nIn terms of subject matter, I learned more about Christianity and my own religion, and of course about the concept of political theology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about historical approaches to the relationship between religion and politics, and the evolution of such ideas to the present day. More importantly, this class was an introduction to college reading, writing, and discussion, and Prof. Stern was an excellent guide in learning those skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about politics and theology in a different way than I had thought about before. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I view the relationship between religion and government. It analyzes concepts like sovereignty, the state of exception, internal and external manifestations of belief, and value. It helped me read texts more critically and forced me to challenge my own beliefs about the role that religion should play in the public sphere. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read historical and religious texts including texts by Locke, Spinoza, and Buber. I also learned about the historical development of sovereignty, particularly how it relates to understandings of religion. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me gain a new perspective on both the historical Israel of the Hebrew Bible, the development of the modern \"secular\" state, and the current state of politics today. "

        [
            "\u00a0Gosh, I loved this class.  I liked how we had set readings each week, but our discussions would go off in interesting directions each time.  I wish we wrote a few more papers as I enjoyed the readings and wanted to talk about them more than just once in class.  Professor Stern is a strength!  I don't think I would enjoy the class this much with a different professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course's biggest strength is the interesting discussions and interconnections brought to the material, largely thanks to Prof. Stern's enthusiasm and focus on lively discussions. Everyone was encouraged to participate, and this seemed to significantly improve the quality of discussions over the course of the semester. The materials seemed well selected to provide insight into the important issues while still being relatively approachable and providing the basis to investigate possible narratives. I would have liked more time devoted to developing writing skills and workshopping drafts, since this course included three papers and seemed to present great opportunities for writing instruction. ",
            "\u00a0It had a lot of reading that I wasn't sure how it helped in the end. However, it was a good course that encouraged participation and different opinions. ",
            "\u00a0The course's greatest strengths were the teaching and the assigned readings. The professor was extremely engaged, and he made each discussion exciting. He was clearly passionate about the topics we covered, and his knowledge of the subject area was apparent. There were many readings, which were sometimes long, but the content of each was incredibly interesting and made for great discussion in class. There was also great breadth in the readings, from Marx to Niebuhr to Locke. The course could be improved by placing greater emphasis on student participation in discussions. ",
            "\u00a0If some of the texts were removed so we could spend more time on the difficult texts, also if the reading assignments were reduced to the crucial sections. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely!  I only took the one freshman seminar, so I don't know if they're all like this, but I doubt it.  Professor Stern treats us as equals, even though he obviously knows so much more than us.  He disagrees with everyone, even with himself sometimes, but he really listens to us and acts like he's never heard our arguments before.  I'm going to miss this class.  I don't have anyone to talk to about political theology now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! This is a great class for anyone interested in learning about the relationship of politics and religion from a historical perspective. Prof. Stern allows students to discuss while frequently adding his own valuable insights. The readings and guest lectures made for a very interesting sample of perspectives on this issue, and Prof. Stern's enthusiasm brings it all together. Note that this course spends relatively little time on writing skills, so you might want to look for another course if that's important to you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, mainly because of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course. Professor Stern was an incredible teacher, and he cared very much about each of his students. His insights about religion and politics made for a class that transformed my personal beliefs. The topics covered were very interesting, and everything I learned had application to daily life.  Anyone interested in philosophy, religion, or political science would enjoy this class very much. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, I found the collision between politics and religion very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in politics and/or religion.  It was fascinating following how the development of political philosophy and religious theology have paralleled each other throughout history until the present day, and I now feel that I gained important insights into Steve Bannon's thinking that I wouldn't have otherwise.
