            "\u00a0I learned an introduction to philosophy, about a lot of research studies, how to read and consider experimental results, and really a strong foundation in philosophy such that I feel comfortable engaging in a discussion on morals. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about essentials of moral perspectives in everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the moral psychology of various groups and ages of people. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the ways human beings differ than animals in their morality, and how we develop morally over time versus what is innate. I thought our section on religion and its connection to morality was fascinating, as well as our discussion of Jonathan Haidt's foundations of morality. I learned how to read and interpret several scientific papers on morality in children. "

            "\u00a0The course was great overall. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the format of the discussion sections, weekly readings, and the reading response prompts that made us think intellectually enough to have educated arguments and discussions. It was not too much work. Definitely do-able. ",
            "\u00a0Good thorough understanding from professor/TA end, but if it was more specific instead of broad topics. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that the course was online. It was very engaging, the professor was great, and the course material was very intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the flexibility of the online format; the clarity and relevance of the reading materials; and the strength of the in-class discussions. I really like the discussion sections and thought the smaller break-out groups were very effective. I also thought all of the readings were really interesting! I would have loved to go more in-depth about the connections between religion and morality (a personal interest) and perhaps more basic moral approaches other than deontology and utilitarianism. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is structured kinda like a late-night dorm room chat. Its super fun and super interesting and will definitely be a great experience for anyone who decides to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It was important to complete the weekly readings, which could feel like a lot at times, but they are all super interesting along with the videos and lectures. It helps to know what you are talking about when you show up for discussion sections. The TA and professor were engaging and great at facilitating conversation. You will learn a great overview of a lot of philosophy topics and learn to make good arguments backed up by evidence and research. We also got great feedback on our papers in a timely manner. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I thought it was an eye-opening look at the things we take for granted with respect to morality, and the ways we can expand our thinking about what moral acting means, and what it means to be  uniquely human. I also thought it provided a really useful framework for talking about different moral approaches (deontology vs utilitarianism). "
