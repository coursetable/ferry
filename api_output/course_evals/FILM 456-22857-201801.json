            "\u00a0I learned so much about documentary films, documentary film editing, the film editing process, story creation, and more from taking this class. I feel like I learned how to express my research and work through a whole new medium - film - and I think that this will serve me very well as I look towards my future. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the process of filmmaking, the challenges faced when setting up interviews, logistical notes to consider when putting together scenes for a film. ",
            "\u00a0Readings and practical skills in documentary filmmaking at the advanced level are on paralleled (at Yale School of Art for example), if for no other reason than at School of art an Advanced documentary project is only available as an independent project with and advisor. With what is available in this course through instruction and materials and hands on experience one can expect to create from start to Finnish a well crafted documentary film. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about shooting, editing, storytelling, interviewing - basically all of the steps required to produce and polish a documentary film. "

            "\u00a0I thought the workshop style of the course was extremely effective for students working on their own films. I liked that, for the first half of the course, we were in groups so we got to watch the progress of other people's films as well. Charlie and Masha were really instructors and were very encouraging, insightful, and helpful in the film editing process. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - flexibility to work on project in a way that matches your schedule.\r\nWeakness - basic fundamentals of Premiere/Final Cut are not taught.\r\nWays it can be improved - half the class focuses on learning a new skill in Premiere/Final Cut, second half of class focuses on independent work on film. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths fall in the structure of the class which opens up time to create something across the span of an entire year. Since one is expected to enter the course with a project in mind, development begins right away and production can be compressed into development stages which is conducive to the style of documentary filmmaking. This is not possible in a single semester where project ideas are developed within the course period and multiple projects must be conceived and executed within that time frame. Access is a biggie. Musser is more than available to his students, his work to see students across the finish line goes beyond the call of duty, is very democratic and often means burning the midnight oil with multiple students at a time in the lab working though tough challenges. The TAs for the course will often opt in for these sessions taking up the energy and energy of the group.\r\n\r\nWeakness might have more to do with student motivation. Graduate students will do very well in this course. The typical Yale undergrad will also do very well in this course, that said you must be motivated to draw out of the course what is needed to get their projects made. It would be easy to get mossed for a student who expects the typical lecture driven environment and accountability structure. That said, this course would never work well in that model. ",
            "\u00a0While I did enjoy the screenings on Tuesdays, I do wish they had been more optional or suggestions rather than required. Sometimes they took up a lot of time when I would have loved to focus on my own project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Musser and Masha were huge strengths because they were incredibly helpful throughout the process and great teachers. The course is great because it is built-in time to work on your film, and I know I gained so much from the overall experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could have been more discussions about why we make films and what the stakes are for documentarians. A broader engagement with documentary theory could have been illuminating. "

            "\u00a0I think that any student who is interested in potentially pursuing a career in research should try to take this class. First of all, it is great fun to edit a film! it is challenging but so rewarding. When editing, I would just totally lose track of time, and all of a sudden it would be midnight! Second, I think film is a very important way to share research on a specific topic with friends, family, and the general public. There is a very select group of people who actually want to read extensive research papers, but most people will agree to watch, and subsequently learn from, a short film. Third, this class is different from most classes at Yale because you actually get to focus on a project you personally care a lot about and this is incredibly rewarding. I would recommend this class highly to anyone who is passionate about a certain subject or about their research! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provides flexibility to create a film. ",
            "\u00a0This course is essential at Yale. As a documentary filmmaker, I can say that no other course will provide the student with what they need to bring their dream into a reality. So many students who populate this course are not interested in film as a career but find that there are some things only film seems to be able to talk about well in culture. This year alone stigmatized topics in public health, environmental studies, gender studies and matters pertaining to  indigenous people groups got tackled by undergrad and grad students. I am an art major and I did a tradition narrative documentary that followed the story of a female bodybuilder. We had an Architecture student who did a film on local Indian tribes in CT. This list goes on... I highly recommend this course to a broad range of students with many different aims. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you really want to make a documentary and are willing to put in that time and mental effort. It is very challenging, but the course is a great support system. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in learning to make a documentary, this is a great course to develop that skill. "
