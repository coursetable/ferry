            "\u00a0This course greatly expanded on my knowledge of Modern Greek, building on the principles of last semester. Through weekly quizzes on grammar and vocab, I picked up lots of conversational skills and feel that my language proficiency really jumped ahead this semester. I enjoyed the daily classes and always felt engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more basic grammar and vocabulary in modern Greek. ",
            "\u00a0Extension of MGRK 110; improvement in grammar fluency and oral ability. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater mastery of the Greek language. ",
            "\u00a0A much more solid foundation of Modern Greek grammar (past tense, imperative, etc.) and an improved set of vocabulary. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class does a really good job of teaching the application of the language as well as the structure so that more than just knowing concepts we actually tried to apply them in conversation. I really don't have too many complaints about how we did anything, although I do think 1 or 2 longer writing assignments would have given me some more practice in compositional writing in Greek. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was well organized and the textbook was mostly helpful. It would help to do more oral practice and oral exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-taught and with only around 10-12 students each received substantial individual attention. ",
            "\u00a0Maria is by far the largest strength of this course. She is an amazing teacher and engages the students very well. A large weakness of the course, however, is the lack of an oral component. I think that if we were graded orally during Midterm and Final exams, we would practice speaking more regularly and have an improved ability to speak. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to anyone with a particular language in the culture or different aspects of Greece. Although it is a niche area, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in the class this year, and it has consistently been one of the better parts of my academic day! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! Maria is a wonderful professor and really engages with her students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, Professor Kalimbou is awesome! ",
            "\u00a0If you are a student of Greek heritage, or an individual interested in Greek politics, culture, history, or art, TAKE MODERN GREEK! Prof Kaliambou is an experienced professor who has taught students, especially heritage students, for years. She is a wonderful mentor who will take the time to ensure that you have the tools to succeed in her class. It is fun, upbeat, and incredibly helpful. Highly highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0YES -  Modern Greek is a fascinating language and Maria is the best! "
