            "\u00a0Plants and People provided me with a broad overview of plant biology, the history plant and human interactions, and the future of ecosystems across the globe. As a history major, it was particularly interesting to see how an agricultural-centric view of history can explain the development of advanced societies. Plants have been and remain such a crucial component of the humans place on earth and this course was quite useful in explaining this reality. ",

            "\u00a0The field trips were surprisingly helpful and connected well with lecture material. Section did not seem necessary about half of the time, however. ",
            "\u00a0field trips were super insightful and interesting, material was really great, the execution was eh ",
            "\u00a0It's amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This is a difficult question. Strengths: engaging students with hands on experience. Undoubtedly, the ability to go on so many field trips was one the best parts of the class.\r\nI believe that a good amount of time in the course is spent explaining what should already be basic knowledge for many students at Yale. However, as Prof. Puth identifies, for an entry level course such as this, it is not safe to assume that anyone has more than a basic background in biology. So while I felt that many lectures were repeating simple statements on plant bio, this is a necessary setback.\r\nThis class is a significant time commitment and while I felt that sections were useful in starting productive discussions on many of the plant-people topics, they added on when I felt bogged down by 3 weekly lectures (with one that meets on a Friday). Are there options for bi-weekly sections?\r\nMoreover, while the tests certainly prove that this is not a hard-science class, I do feel like bringing a more liberal arts perspective to a science class made the tests hard to navigate. Because we were not working with direct chemical reactions or biological processes, the questions were often open ended and I felt challenged in that I couldnt expect what were supposed to demonstrate in our answers. ",
            "\u00a0Field trips are awesome \r\nTests are too hard ",
            "\u00a0The course was greatly improved by the amount of field trips we had. The major weakness was that it tried to do to much with history and mixed humanities and science to the point where people on both sides were disappointed. Emphasize plant science and don't try to do too much with people. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Covers a lot, so cant always go very in depth. Field trips are awesome, helpful and fun. Classes were interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it requires very little background knowledge. The weaknesses of the course were overall issues with organization, time distribution, and the lack of clarity in tests. The lectures were in general poorly organized and often lacked cohesion between or even within lectures. The lectures and field trips also often could not fit in the scheduled 50 minutes, which was frustrating for those who had  other commitments immediately thereafter. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging, but I think the science portion of the course could be improved. The exam questions are often confusing and unclear as to what they are asking. There is a fine balance between applying course concepts and stretching them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Puth is such a fantastic teacher! So kind and passionate and great at explaining a wide variety of things from plant botany to human civilization development. Other strengths of the class are the variety of topics and how well they're taught; class field trips and activities. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the questions on the exams were worded in ways that made them confusing to answer. I felt that I could have done better on some examinations had certain questions been worded more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interactive; field trips; personal professor to student interaction\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Takes up a lot of time; test preparation is lacking; lecture slides could be more helpful (in guiding students towards important information) ",
            "\u00a0Some quite interesting topics. Course could be improved with more engaging lectures and tests that are more fair (the exam questions were often very confusing and niche compared to the lectures). ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot of work for any sort of course -- made it feel like I was always studying for exams and papers rather than directly engaging in the content. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that this course brought in a lot of different topics and considered different perspectives. I also liked that it took nuanced approaches to topics like mass-market agriculture, evaluating both pros and cons. The sections were great, as were the field trips. And it was amazing to get to interact with physical objects while discussing the concepts in class, such as with the fruit, fermentation, and spice lectures. In terms of weaknesses, I think that the lectures could be a little long and monotonous, and sometimes we spent a lot of time on things that we didn't really need to know in detail but skipped over things that we did need to know in detail. For example, we learned a lot of examples of fruits and spices in detail and spent several weeks on fermentation, but the ecology and conservation units at the end seemed kind of rushed. The exams were also a weak point in the class. While I appreciated the thought put into making the questions application-based rather than just knowledge-based, the wording was often too vague and caused confusion. During the final, about three or four questions required verbal clarification to the whole class. Two things that I think might improve exams are giving an example of the type of answer desired and specifying if there is more than one answer available. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the exam questions were more clearly worded. In many cases, points were taken off for not explaining when the question did not ask for an explanation, etc. It felt a little as though we were being graded on our ability to read the test writer's mind rather than our ability to accurately respond to the posed question.

            "\u00a0This class is FUN ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Just beware that Professor Puth grades fairly strictly on exams and makes them more challenging that most students expect. Also, it meets three times a week, has mandatory section, has two midterms, a final, and a final paper. So not too gutty... ",
            "\u00a0Id probably recommend Conservation Biology over this course. Every year people bust their backs to get into this class. The field trips are pretty cool but most of what youre learning is pretty uninspiring and its a lot more work than what you think. ",
            "\u00a0it is not a gut... it is a lot of work, but mostly interesting ",
            "\u00a0100% if you can get in. However, if you are bad at test-taking or you don't feel that you're good with concrete facts (as opposed to abstract thinking), it might be harder than the name suggests. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if youre interested in fulfilling the science requirement and building on a basic high school biology background. You will repeat many things you already know, but will also learn new, cool interesting things about plants. The field trips can be extremely fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but they must study hard for the exams ",
            "\u00a0Weird blend of science and humanities. Take with caution. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, Professor Puth is so kind and a great and engaging teacher. The material is super cool and interesting if youre into the environment and the ways humans and nature have coevolved. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to one type of person  those who really are genuinely passionate about plants and have the time in their schedule to do lots of independent learning. The frustrating part of this class was that it wasn't exactly a gut, but it wasn't a serious and rewarding rigorous course either. The test questions were often \"tricky\" or poorly worded, or required specific depth on a very small topic. I often felt as if my hands were tied; I was willing to work hard and put in effort to learn and do well on the material, but it felt like my work was both meaningless and fruitless. It was a lot of work for not a lot of reward, and it wasn't satisfying in the way a traditionally \"hard\" class is often either. Feedback was murky and standing in class was often along the lines of \"you're doing fine!\" when asked how to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any non-science major who seeks a science credit but does not aim to learn about too much science. ",
            "\u00a0IT'S THE BEST!!!! Such a fun and interesting class, Professor Puth is so great. Awesome field trips, variety of interesting topics. The course itself is not overly challenging which makes learning the material actually enjoyable. Can't recommend this class highly enough! Even though it looks like a lot of time (3 classes per week plus section) it never felt like a chore. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is very passionate about plants. The course takes up a decent amount of time- almost as much as an L3 or L4 language class- so this is not a class for a student just looking to check of a science credit. Students must be willing to go up science hill four times a week and to possibly take the shuttle up to the green house or another field trip location every now and then. One's TF can also be integral in how well one does in this course. This class involves a lot of independent learning because lecture can be unhelpful but test questions will be very specific. So students willing to read the textbook and go in for office hours frequently and are passionate about plants/ its relationship to humans should find this course okay. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not unless you are genuinely very interested in the subject. I found it very hard in a way that was not necessarily intellectually challenging, but more so irritating. I did not feel that the exams fairly evaluated a grasp of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not a gut -- despite what you've heard. I would recommend it for people who really struggle with scientific components as it seems more real -- you'll look at a plant in real time to analyse the technical parts. It is not a walk through the park, however. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was a lovely overview of a variety of topics, providing biological, ecological, sociocultural and artistic perspectives on plants now and throughout history. There was opportunity to go deeper into areas of interest, particularly through the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I would say it felt a lot like a high school biology class...so if you like that kind of thing, it might be for you. I personally enjoyed the topics we learned about, but, looking back, I'm not sure I felt particularly challenged or fulfilled by the course. It's not that it's easy to ace the exams or the project, but I felt like it was very hit-or-miss in terms of grading and putting in extra effort didn't seem to do much. Something that made the class really fun was the diversity in both topics and people. There was a wide range of majors and years represented, and almost every week was a new topic, from the spice trade to fermentation to climate change. Your grade is based on two midterms, a project/paper, a short presentation, and a final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I enjoyed it and found it interesting. "
