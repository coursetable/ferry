Problem sets are due every 3 classes, and we had three problems to solve. It felt like I was thinking about the problems every waking minute of my week. I improved my proof writing significantly, since most of the grade comes from problem sets. The problem sets are graded carefully, so you really have to demonstrate a rigorous proof of each problem to score well. Working on such a few number of problems for such a long time really built up my endurance for thinking about problems like these. I think it made me a more patient problem solver. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty interesting and reasonable to follow (some 365 students actually started coming bc the lectured were much better than theirs). Most of this class is based on the psets; the first 4 or so were pretty time consuming, taking 15-20 hours to complete, as they required coming up with some pretty involved algorithms and proofs. The last 4 were much more reasonable, and only took 5-10 hours each.  Grading seems to be pretty generous, as done without a curve for the most part, with psets counting for 80% ",
            "\u00a0Shoutout to the ULAs! Since the course is difficult and due to the emphasis on individual problem-solving, there are lots of times when you know a general idea of how to solve a homework problem but are unsure of how exactly to fit the parts together, and I think the ULAs this semester did a great job of offering guidance/hints without giving the problem away. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the fact that collaboration is not allowed in the problem sets, since it encourages students to really think and understand the ins and outs of each problem. I had to pull an all-nighter for nearly each one of them, despite having worked ahead, yet the process of solving these problems and arriving at the solution is always rewarding. \r\n\r\nI also liked the use of GradeScope, since it is really easy to check scores, comments, and ask for regrading.

            "\u00a0Psets were interesting and diverse. The final examination, by contrast, was bland repetition of material already discussed. It would have been much better if it required critical thinking or analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the psets were challenging, but short and consistent (every 3 classes). The final exam covered only material learned in class.\r\nNo weaknesses to report. ",
            "\u00a0The difficulty of the problem sets was well-calibrated. We rigorously kept to the syllabus schedule: two weeks on a concept, a problem set due every 3rd class. I spent easily 20-30 hours on each problem set. Yang Cai almost always lectured from the proofs in the textbook, but the textbook is pretty helpful, so that was not frustrating. From what I have heard, Dan Spielman diverged from the textbook more than Cai. The material is pretty inherently interesting, although I felt lectures were sometimes very dry.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since collaboration is prohibited, we had to sign up for 1-on-1 office hour slots in 10 minute intervals. It sometimes felt like the ULAs themselves did not know how to do the problems, which made trying to get help during office hours pretty difficult. The final exam was much much easier to do well on than the assignments. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. The material was very well-organized, the lectures were very clear, the expectations were laid out neatly, and the grading was very reasonable. Furthermore, there were plenty of resources for us to use and we benefited greatly from being able to chat with TAs consistently. The material was incredibly interesting, and this was by far one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were extremely clear, well-organized, and served as a great starting point for the problem sets. The problem sets offered a great exposition on the topic for the week, and the no collaboration policy forced you to sit and think about a problem (often for hours) until you can build intuition and a deeper understanding. I felt by the time I submitted each problem set that I understood that week's technique at a much deeper level than after just hearing about it in class. Another strength that I have to point out is the timeliness of assignment grading: Professor Cai and the TAs made it a point to give back the previous assignment (graded with detailed feedback and comments) before the next assignment was due, and were patient with regrade requests as they came up. This was extremely helpful in helping me improve and made sure I was always aware of how I was doing in the class.\r\n\r\nIt's hard for me to come up with any weaknesses at all if I had to put something, I would say that the TAs were at times inconsistent with their advice or would not know the answer themselves, so perhaps more TA training and coordination could have helped. (Overall, the TAs were extremely helpful each week, and their advice generally walked the line between giving you something to go off of and not giving away the entire answer quite well). ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses - Very intense office hours, where you have 10 minutes on the clock five times a week to ask mostly clarification questions about the pset. This could be made better with more office hours.\r\nStrenghts - No hand-holding. It makes you grow confident on the topic as you're solving thing absolutely on your own. If you can make this class, you can pretty much solve most coding interview questions. ",

I found myself often times getting lost in lecture, but being able to return later on to synthesize those ideas. The course was one that presented ideas in a very intuitive way, and made the material and difficult problem sets worth understanding. ",

Even for those (like myself) who may not pursue theoretical computer science, this skill is essential in the workforce (especially at interviews). ",
