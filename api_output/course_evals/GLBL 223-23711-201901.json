            "\u00a0SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS, it's wonderful. Knowledge on infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, mental health, global burden of disease, social determinants of disease, case studies, ethics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much. I feel like I have a much better grasp on and understanding of global health. I am so motivated to work more on these problems even though I am not going directly into the field ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Global/Public Health and this course really opened my eyes to the idea of seeing health in a different perspective. It really humanized medicine for me, which I think is something you can lose on the pre-med track. I really learned a lot about how to read and analyze data and it opened my eyes to a lot of the issues in health that may be removed, but do implicate the U.S. It's a wonderful class taught by a professor who truly cares about the topic and I highly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me to develop writing skills specific to global health. Both of the writing assignments were not traditional essays, but rather required students to write concept notes or policy briefs, research a specific issue in a specific country, and suggest an intervention. The writing assignments were challenging because they weren't something most students were familiar with, but they were interesting to write and gave a good idea of what global health writing actually looks like. \r\nThe class also helped me develop a better ability to understand the interconnectedness of global health and the multidisciplinary nature of this field. We looked at almost every topic through a variety of different lenses, from anthropology to the environment. \r\nIt also helped me understand some of the global health issues that we hear about on the news all the time (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Ebola) in a more comprehensive way. ",
            "\u00a0Global health challenges, resolutions, failures of current systems, integration with other fields. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough understanding of the global structures surrounding public health and the biology and epidemiology of the most pressing diseases facing global health. I also gained the skills to think critically about the intersections of many different fields and how they impact global health. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO SO much from this course. As a preface, I took this course on a whim, because it was the most interesting 5th course that counted for my major and fit in my schedule. I chose this course, because in the first lecture, I could feel professor Talbelt-Slagel's passion, and I thought  hey, this material is kind of cool. I WAS SO RIGHT!\r\n\r\nI did not know ANYTHING about global health. As a result of taking this course, I learned really interesting content including: why vaccines work, how different health systems in the world operate, how global aid works (and the power structures of global aid), I learned about infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria and I learned about non-communicable diseases like Cardiovascular disease and diabetes, I also learned about the ethics of research. \r\n\r\nThe best thing about this class (and trust me, there are many good things) is that the TA's and professor challenge you to think of systemic problems that perpetuate poverty in the world today (these were called causes of causes). \r\n\r\nI CANNOT recommend this class more. There are 2 essays, a midterm and a final, but if you go to class and start the essays 3ish days before they're due, you will be fine! TAKE THIS CLASS! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! ",
            "\u00a0While I knew many of the things we learned already in the global health basics realm, but hearing a lot of those things from a first-person perspective from incredible speakers like the former prime minister of Liberia (during the Ebola outbreak) and an activist of the 1980s ACTUP movement cements those things. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about things related to global health like disparities, ethics, infectious diseases, causes of causes, healthcare systems, non-communicable diseases, etc. Learned to write a concept note and policy brief, which I had never done before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about global health in such a short period of time and I cant wait to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Basic knowledge about the current state of affairs with respect to Global Health with emphasis on causes of causes, double burden of disease, etc. NCDs vs. CDs. Some case studies on bioethics as well (Belmont Report, Common Rule, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Increased understanding of equity in global health, power and privilege dynamics underlying funding and research, ethics, communicable and noncommunicable diseases: causes, cure/prevention, and social determinants (causes of causes) ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course was thought provoking and intellectually challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a very useful general overview of global health that has completely altered my view of the world and the dynamics that impact health of individuals around the globe. This class also provides excellent criticism of academia and the efficacy of certain global health interventions in addressing various global health challenges through case studies and guest lecturers who work extensively in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the causes of certain diseases and the causes of those causes. Through the speakers, I also developed a broader sense of health crises and the ethics of global health. ",
            "\u00a0Survey knowledgy of global health topics, responses, pathology, systems analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Learned some stuff about global health and the professor really was trying to emphasize the non-biological drivers of health but I kind of thought this was kind of obvious (eg. of course living in poverty is often going to lead to worse health outcomes). ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to global health funding, infectious and non communicable disease, social determinants of health, and many more topics. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the variety of topics, teaching style, relevance to real life. \r\nWeaknesses: the length seems too long and could really be taught in 50 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material is really great. I wish we had more feedback on and guidance for our writing assignmemts. I also think that section was only good when we were actually doing activities that reviewed class material (ie: drawing the treatment cascade). I think the discussions were really unproductive. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Talbert-Slagle is great about putting up learning objectives for each class, so she makes it very clear what she expects you to have gotten from the lesson. She is very organized and her lectures are super informative! She's very open to you asking questions about anything you don't understand and she's encourages people to challenge and ask more about the slides she shows in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe way Prof. Talbert Slagle teaches the course makes it super engaging. She often used multiple different methods of teaching and would alternate between Powerpoints, drawing out concept maps on the whiteboard, and having us discuss in small groups. Although it was not a small class, she always encouraged participation. \r\nThe guest speakers. Each guest speaker came from an incredibly different background and these different backgrounds really showed how multidisciplinary global health is. Hearing from people from a variety of different perspectives in the field was one of my favorite parts of this class.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the class was a bit disorganized and readings wouldn't be posted until weeks after the class they were supposed to be done for. This made it hard to stay up to date on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly interesting, teacher and guest speakers were phenomenal. Incredible breadth of content. \r\nDepth was not very large but makes sense, given quantity of content covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely well-structured, and I always looked forward to going to lecture every Tuesday and Thursday. This course benefits greatly from having a professor and team of TFs who are obviously passionate about global health and are excited to introduce students to the field. My only complaint is that because SO much material was covered, lectures often felt rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Talbert-Slagle worked very hard to collect feedback throughout the semester, and responds real time to recommendations students have to improve the course. \r\n\r\nI have three suggestions for how the course could be improved. \r\n\r\n(1) In the WASH segment, actually explain what menstruation is. Include this in slides and in a learning objective, that will later be covered on an exam. This will serve two purposes (1) it will normalize conversation around periods and help make women feel less awkward about a system occurring in THEIR BODIES! (2) it will teach anyone who isn't sure how a period works what it is, and why it's a critical process in the creation of life. \r\n\r\n(2) I really appreciated all the diagrams and drawings you created to help us understand concepts. However, sometimes they were very difficult to capture. It'd be great if you could take a picture of the diagram and then TA's could go over them in section. I know you want students to come to class, so you don't want to put all the diagrams in all the class notes, but as a student who ALWAYS went to class, I think I would have really benefitted from this. \r\n\r\n(3) I really appreciated that the writing assignments were applications of concepts that we discussed in class. However, I felt that the second writing assignment was incredibly ambitious and did not have sufficiently clear guidance for all it was asking. I felt that I spent 70% of my time researching data to justify my proposal rather than coming up with my proposal itself. I found this very tedious and not fun to write. More guidance on what data would be recommended for the policy brief or on what is expected from the policy brief would have been appreciated! ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course included incredible speakers like the former prime minister of Liberia (during the Ebola outbreak) and an activist of the 1980s ACTUP movement. Another strength included Professor Talbert-Slagle, who always made it a priority to listen to the students, make global health interdisciplinary, and emphasize the human-ness of everything. ",
            "\u00a0I think grading was a bit harsh on writing assignments but the tests were fair if you studied. Biggest strengths were the material and Professor T-S, she really cared about our learning and did her best to make the classroom as inclusive as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging course, largely because it was focused on real-world happenings. Guest speakers were also very interesting, informative and inspiring. I do not have nay problems with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Its a perfect introductory course because it gives a glimpse of every aspect of global health. One weakness though is that not much time was spent on mental health/neurological disorders/substance use disorders. I really liked the speakers/guest lecturers ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are certainly Dr. Talbert-Slagle's enthusiasm, her passion for the material, and emphasis on grade equity. Furthermore, fantastic guest lectures really gave us insight into the real world of Global Health. Could be improved by talking more about data and its sources, biases implicit (we covered it a little, but don't think many of us were that comfortable with it). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great variety of topics covered in the class, guest lecturers offered interesting perspectives that tied everything we were taught to the real world, interesting class to take; Improvements: more engaging group activities in class ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught and designed for student learning and engagement. The readings were confusing to access and it would be helpful to have the notes ahead of time to review and take notes alongside ",
            "\u00a0I think it was nice to go over a wide variety of topics but it led to some topics not being covered in depth enough ",
            "\u00a0Strength: weekly material and lectures were engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this course should provide more opportunities for students to be assessed on the material than just the 2 papers, midterm, and final. ",
            "\u00a0this course is very introductory and focused on elementary-like learning of global health issues ",
            "\u00a0The course was full of interesting and relevant information for global health. However, it was very poorly organized. the readings and lecture notes  were hard to find on the canvas page, prof almost never got through all of what she said she planned to, most of the class was spent talking about logistics that were barely relevant to the whole class. The assignments were poorly explained and asked us to do tasks that were far beyond what is reasonable to expect in an introductory survey class. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the exercises trivialize the importance of the concepts. We did a lot of \"turn to your neighbor and talk about 3 things that surprise you\" - type exercises every class, which served more to waste class time than actually inspire learning. I think weekly reading responses/class reactions that ask those questions and more reaction questions would be better. The papers were strangely graded, and the TFs took off points for no reason other than they couldn't give everyone an A. This class needs to rethink its assignment structure. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Whether you are super interested in health and medicine or even just slightly curious, this class will really open your eyes to issues in Global Health. the knowledge you gain pushes you to question your own role and the U.S.'s role in Global Health and what that means for the world. This course is very interdisciplinary and challenges you to think about the causes of causes of health. It humanizes the field and teaches you to look at things through many different lenses. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was an incredible introduction to global health and the topics we covered were consistently presented in an engaging and thoughtful way. Even when the topics we covered were very different, there was a set of underlying concepts that were present throughout the whole class. Hearing from the guest speakers was a really incredible way to understand how many different ways there are to be involved in global health. Prof. Talbert Slagle is one of the most enthusiastic and passionate teachers I have ever been taught by, and she really taught this class in such an intentional, powerful, and effective way. \r\nThis class is absolutely not just for premed students and these topics are things that everyone should know about. ",

            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another students because the material you learn in this course is relevant to everyone. Because Professor Talbert-Slagle is so passionate about the material and about her student's learning, she makes sure to teach the material in a way that makes it fascinating to anyone regardless of your level of background (for context, I had never previously taken a global health course).

            "\u00a0YES. Highly recommend. Anyone should take this course to truly open your eyes to the global community, but those conducting research or interested in research should take this class to get an understanding of what true issues are in the world and how not to loose sight of the individuals at the end of the road. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really loved it. Super engaging, readings are actually worthwhile. You get informed about what is actually happening right now in the world. Gives you a new perspective on what health is and how it affects people worldwide. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is so interesting and eye-opening ",
            "\u00a0Sure, if they are looking for a semi-easy class that teaches them things that don't necessarily need a formal class setting to be taught. Most of the special learning comes from the guest lecturers. Felt great to learn from minds at the forefront of the field. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this class- global health is a topic that everyone should be knowledgeable about; it is key to understanding the world as a whole. The instructor is fantastic and passionate and not even a minute of lecture will be wasted time. You will look at the world differently after this course. ",

            "\u00a0I think for people who don't know anything about global health/public health coming in and are used to thinking of health in a very narrow medicalized way this could be a useful class but if you already have some background in public health probably not the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a great intro to global health ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're looking for an easy 5th Cred/D. Not a lot of work, and making friends with your TF means you'll get an A. Prof. KTS is really amazing person and she has great ideas and stories, but is a little overextended so don't expect to get any of your grades back promptly/at all. If you know anything about global health though, don't take it - there are better classes that go deeper into more interesting topics, and frankly you'll be super bored. ",
