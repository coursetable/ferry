            "\u00a0I'm not sure what the goal of this class was.\r\n\r\nWe spent several weeks reviewing the different study designs and it ended up just being a journal club, which was not helpful for the majority of the class, who already had experience reading articles. I would recommend adding a supplemental journal club for interested students. Because of the time spend criticizing papers, we never really built a strong foundation of the definitions of Epi. Towards the end of the class, the review session still had multiple students asking for explanations of basic definitions like OR or AR.\r\n\r\nInstead of being an introduction to epi, it ended up being the professor asking \"how can I make basic definitions like prevalence and incidence as tricky as possible.\" I understand that the goal was to show even people in epidemiology do not use these words appropriately, however, it ended up taking away from actually learning the core material because then the discussions would just become arguments as tricky often ends up meaning vague which leads to multiple perspectives being right, depending on how they read the question. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent review of study design with great examples from a variety of fields leading to stimulating in class examples. Was nice not to read same studies from same field over and over. By nature it must be fast paced so some of the difficult concepts were done very quickly because of consolidated nature of course, but readings and slides were very logical and helpful overall. ",
            "\u00a0Epi was a great foundation to public health, helping me build skills to take with me into the business environment. ",
            "\u00a0Good basic epidemiology course. Would like to have more explanations in the powerpoints. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught. Material was clearly explained and I appreciated that reading material covered a variety of subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings are enjoyable and even entertaining at times, lectures are engaging, PSETs helped me solidify concepts from class and readings \r\nWeaknesses: classes can feel a bit rushed at times, especially toward the end ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introductory epidemiology course. The material was presented in a clear and engaging way. I would ask, however, that Dr. Desai recommend to future students that they print out his lecture slides before each class (or that he provides the slides for the class). I didn't realize until pretty late in the course that taking notes directly on the slides while Dr. Desai reviews them would be the most effective way to absorb the class material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it teaches you to critically think about the public health issues that our society is challenged with, specifically how to look at diseases and to understand various studies and publishing.  It teaches you to question and evaluate things that researchers often publish as being valid or not valid or specific tailoring of those studies to certain situations.  \r\nIts weakness is its course book. \r\nDr. Desai has a lot of great material, I hope he publishes a book, it is the kind of material that will make great leaders of tomorrow. ",
            "\u00a0covered a significant amount of material, encouraged critical thinking and deep reading of papers. Felt at time topics were covered without enough time to go into explicit examples leaving some of the homework/final exam questions to seem somewhat inferential instead of testing clearly taught principles (for example, calculation of additive interaction as a HW question when it wasn't clearly taught in lecture). Given that this was a summer course (and apparently previously spread over 3 days a week) this is understandable and can perhaps remain a twice a week course with fine tuning. ",
            "\u00a0Main strength was that Mayur is an engaging professor. Main downside was that I felt the emphasis was on him/the TF being right/following the algorithm of the class rather than being more adaptable (ie, slides and HW key should be available for us to learn). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good introduction to epidemiology. Good clear structure. Fast feedback on assessments\r\n\r\nAreas for improvement:\r\nI feel we spent too much time on the study design section which meant the material towards the end of the course, which I found conceptually more difficult, felt rushed. Perhaps just have one example paper per study type to read? I'm not sure that spending a lot of time going through a paper in class in detail really helped my understanding of the study types. Maybe just focus on the key concepts for each study type eg selection of subjects\r\n\r\nWhen it came to studying, I found the slides didn't always have all of the text on them, for example when looking at additive vs multiplicative interactions so I had to revert to trying to understand it from the text which wasn't that helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a very useful course with lots of learning opportunities. The major issue with the course year is that the core material seemed like it was rushed through. I think cutting down the course to 2 times a week as opposed to 3 times a week affected the course negatively. I felt like a lot of time was spent on reviewing the papers that described study designs but not enough time was spent on reviewing core topics that was the focus of most of the homework. I also felt that the homework was graded harshly particularly since it felt like we rushed through the information on the homework in class. For future summers, i would recommend reverting back to the 3 times a week Epidemiology sessions. I would also recommend spending more time in class working through in class exercises. ",

            "\u00a0This is an amazing course for learning epidemiology. Professor Desai uses a variety of research articles for teaching methods, which are enjoyable and make learning the course content fun. I really enjoyed this course. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Desai's engaging personality and understanding of readings, such that he seamlessly refers to them when giving examples.  Phoebe (TF) in responding to conceptual emails. Overall, relatively fair homeworks and final exam; no Friday classes!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Phoebe's (TF's) grading was unnecessarily harsh with multiple points being deducted even if the concept was correct but the diction differed slightly from her key. ",

I think the book was too technical and would recommend switching to the Gordis textbook, which a number of us purchased/used on our own to help learn the concepts better.  The homework was very difficult, but that's not a bad thing.  It was a lot of work but it helped to make the concepts of the course more concrete and helped bring everything home.  It was also well designed in that many of us got together outside of class and worked through the problems and showed each other different methods we had used and helped flush out gaps in understanding.\r\n\r\nThe slides, however, are very hard to understand at times.  I think this is because legends aren't repeated/used at times and it can be difficult to decipher acronyms, especially when there are a lot of them and they have similar letters. ",

He is very open to questions and exhibits good reflective listening when speaking with students.  His lecture notes are very good. My only minor complaint is that I would prefer to have lecture notes uploaded in advance so I can print and annotate the slides as the lecture occurs which would make things more efficient for myself as a student rather than annotating computer notes. Professor Desai did explain his reasoning for not uploading beforehand at the beginning of this course which I understood completely. ",

The homework related to this lecture would have been less stressful if after the more systematic Biostatistics teaching on the topic ",

Shows up with energy.\r\nweaknesses: Sometimes long stories, leads to moving too slowly through course material.

            "\u00a0This is an excellent course for anyone interested in public health, I really enjoyed it.  The good thing about this course is that it covers many topics, including some that go beyond the first level Epidemiology, so it really provides a very strong base on how to critically analyze epidemiological issues.  This course really helped me understand how to put on my critical thinking hat and view healthcare decision making from different angels.  Dr Desai was excellent in helping us understand that.  I really liked his socratic method of teaching.  \r\n\r\nConversely, my criticism of this course is that it taught at a level for students who intend in doing some level of research (or would be researchers), while many of the individuals in the class are not intending to be researchers but rather administrators.  That is where the other methods of understanding diseases would be handy such as qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing issues related to diseases; (figuring out risk/reward/compensation/cost & benefit scenarios, implementation of standards of care, etc.), these would be more helpful for healthcare administrators.  \r\n\r\nMy other potential criticism of this course is that although majority of the students will do well in taking this course, some of us who are non-science will not do as well, so although I really liked this course a lot, I do not want my grades/passing to suffer so much because this course is really intended to challenge students with science based backgrounds. If Yale wants to produce the senior leaders of tomorrow, my suggestion at this juncture would be to try to gear this course more toward healthcare administrators including for those who are of science based backgrounds. I believe that the overall purpose of most of the people in this program (regardless of whether they are physicians or business people or lawyers) is to be better administrators in their respective organizations.  \r\n\r\nNote: From my experience, one of the hardest things for a healthcare leaders is to figure out (from a statistical strategic perspective) whether: (I) a merger or acquisition will work out well; or (ii) whether to use product A versus product B for a particular type of cure/procedure given their cost, benefits and risks, or (iii) whether to add a wing to the hospital for specific purposes like neonatal unit or whether to change a wing in a hospital from being preventative medicine based to being more cancer or more orthopedic issues based; (iv) whether to build a hospital in a certain area given the population and demographics, (v) the impact on healthcare costs and benefit of a change in standard of care, policy or law, etc.  That is something all senior healthcare administrators need to understand better and be able to strategize to lead public health organizations. Most administrators do not have a comprehensive understanding of these issues. \r\n\r\nPlease note, I offer the above suggestions with two things in mind:  this is only my first semester at Yale, so I don't really know the depth and breadth of what lies ahead till I take more courses; and conversely, I join this program after having many years of business and law experience and I do believe I have an idea of what the future leaders in healthcare need.

Better for those outside of healthcare or if they have a lot of distance from med school didactics.
