            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the class in my opinion was that it met five days a week enabling me to practice my signing everyday, which had a marked effect on my fluency and skill level. The weakness of the class in my opinion was that it was a little unclear in terms of how the content was organized, although this was the first year so some growing pains are expected. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Jessica is great and always available to help. I learned a ton and my asl improved a lot. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The instructor is amazing, and the course itself was fun, engaging, and informative. ASL is so different from any other language, and it requires you to think in a completely different way than you do in any other Yale course/subject. "
