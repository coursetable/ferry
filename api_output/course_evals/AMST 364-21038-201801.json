            "\u00a0Before taking this class, I used to watch documentaries for just their informational value and would take them for face value. However, I now find myself scrutinizing the littlest of details in documentaries such as political agenda, bias, growth of a director's technique, etc. Learning these skills have made watching documentaries more of a valuable experience for me. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class I developed analytical skills that allowed me to assess a piece of art work in a critical fashion. This was a fantastic introduction to both film and documentary making, in order to establish an understanding of techniques that filmmakers use. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of documentary film as a genre. We learned about its history, the different kinds of 'gaze', rhetoric, and structure etc. that the filmmaker can employ to achieve different goals. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-film studies major, I learned how to critically analyze documentaries "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was its structure of 1 lecture a week, 1 film screening, and 1 discussion section. Due to the class' small size, this format proved to be very effective for me in engaging with the material beyond what would be possible from a larger lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The class could be improved by increasing the enrollment into the course. Perhaps specify that not all Wednesday screenings are necessary if the student is able to watch alone, since many students may have class conflicts with the T,W,Th meeting times. ",
            "\u00a0This class was interesting and I really enjoyed the content. I thought the days on which Professor Musser lectured to the class were distinctly better than the discussion days. The content of the lectures was clear and interesting, especially the first section of the course in which we focused on the history of documentary as a form. Although, at times I did feel that we focused a bit too much on the practical side and on what seemed like the social scene of documentary filmmakers. \r\nThis class could be improved by:\r\n- Having more students enrolled\r\n- Sitting in a format more suited to discussion (i.e. a table or chairs arranged in a circle)\r\n- Having better transitions within discussion\r\n- More clearly establishing which readings were mandatory and which were supplementary\r\n- Having stricter deadlines\r\n- Giving the final paper less weight or allowing us to submit a draft (for a small percentage), get feedback, then submit a final version (for a larger percentage)\r\n- Fewer 'Docucard events' required for the class, and a clearer explanation of what counted as a Docucard event, and sharing upcoming events with students ahead of time\r\n- Not expecting students to be able to go to every film in EFFY\r\n\r\nI think this class may actually work better as an intimate lecture class, perhaps with only a small component of discussion, if any at all. The reading responses were a good way to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The readings could be a little more targetted towards what we were watching that week, but otherwise great! ",
            "\u00a0Great material - I loved the movies and articles we read.  However, class discussions were often somewhat aimless and I felt they could have been structured better. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that do not generally watch documentaries or do not know much about environmental topics. This describes me as I was before taking the course, and I have definitely learned a lot by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would reccomend this course to other students since the topics not only facilitate an introduction to film but also allows one to engage with the filmmakers and current issues in society. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student unless some major changes were made. If it were lecture class then yes, I would recommend it if you're interested in the environment or in documentary as a genre. The lecture portions were very interesting, however, Professor Musser just isn't suited to leading a discussion. We had a very small class, so maybe with 10+ students it would have been different. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you enjoy watching documentaries you will love this class whether you know anything about environmental studies or not "
