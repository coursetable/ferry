            "\u00a0Continued practice with language and grammar. Pretty much the same stuff as in L1 and L2. ",

            "\u00a0Spanish is hard. ",
            "\u00a0More advanced grammar and verb tenses than in previous classes. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my level of comfort speaking in Spanish. I cemented much of the grammar and vocabulary that I had learned in previous Spanish courses. I had the opportunity to discuss topics that were important to me, and that I hope to someday be able to talk about fluently with Spanish speakers, including world affairs and domestic politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about grammar and improved on my speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to conjugate verbs more quickly and easily and understand Spanish sentence structures rather than directly translating from English. "

            "\u00a0One of this course's strengths is definitely the professor, Sabastin Daz. He always tries to make class fun and inviting, and genuinely cares about his students. The level of difficulty for the readings could be better balanced. Some you can understand without the dictionary, while others had entire incomprehensible sentences. ",
            "\u00a0The daily homework was not very enjoyable. The language requirement is a huge waste of time unless you actually achieve proficiency with a language. There goes 4.5 credits of college down the drain... ",
            "\u00a0It is a little monotonous. But my professor was great. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher was amazing, material was actually solid... more culture? ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is well taught, it is just difficult to stay engaged as student if you are just trying to complete the language requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Meeting every day was pretty exhausting and overwhelming. There were some classes for which a great deal of preparation was required. For others, I think the general understanding of most students was that there were times when overwhelming work for other classes took over the time we had for daily Spanish assignments. There were a number of Spanish language sources that we interacted with, most of which were engaging. For me, the greatest strength of the course came from the instructor's willingness to consistently engage with us in and out of class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well balanced between going over grammar and practicing speaking during class with partners.  Overall I think the class did not have any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The supersite homeworks felt like busy work sometimes, but they never took too long so it wasn't that big of a deal. "

            "\u00a0I would! I care deeply about improving my Spanish, and I felt that SPAN130 was a great environment in which to work on that skill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it greatly improved my knowledge of spanish and also was very enjoyable to attend, which was good because it was everyday. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed this course and it was nice to take my first semester at Yale because it is very similar to a high school Spanish class which was comforting. "
