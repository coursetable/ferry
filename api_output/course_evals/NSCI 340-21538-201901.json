            "\u00a0This course gives a very wide but thorough introduction to the neural processes associated with: visuomotor processing, some processing with other senses, attention, executive control, decision-making, emotion, and social cognition. It has a big focus on learning from the actual studies, so experimental methods and tasks were also a big part of the material. I think it's very good for the material it teachesI learned all of this, with insights on how the brain is organized, possible ways to define and track \"cognition,\" and a solid foundation for learning more about adjacent topics. However, I think I was hoping for more emphasis on theories related to cognition and neuroscience more broadly, while this course focuses much more on neural circuitry. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first neuroscience course, so I learned a lot not just content-wise about cognitive neuroscience but also skill-wise learned how to ask neuroscience questions "

            "\u00a0Content can be hard, so try to keep of track of what parts of the brain is discussed in what chapter. Office hours is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Slides are excellent. Range of papers highly appropriate for the course. Steve is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0It's very informative, well thought out, and appropriately difficult in my opinion. I would've loved for it to be a seminar instead of a lecture, which would allow for more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how different functions in the brain function, but I also learned a ton about research methods and experimental methods. This course taught me a lot about how lower level functions connect to higher level processes like decision making, executive function, emotion, and social cognition. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course is that it presents the course topics through primary literature. This teaches not only the content, but also critical thinking about experimentation and scientific conclusions. Rather than memorizing facts, we understood where the facts came from. That being said, there was little cohesion between the 5-10 papers presented in each lecture. I often left lecture having learned lots of interesting things, but having no idea how they all fit together. I feel that the course would benefit from presenting slightly fewer papers to make time to discuss how the individual conclusions of the paper's come together to make a point. Additionally, the course could benefit from some form of weekly assignment. I think that this would both aid retention of material and reduce student stress around exam times, since right now the entire grade is based on one short paper, a midterm, and a final. While this grading scheme seems nice at first because little work is required during most of the semester, as other course assignments pile up, it's easy to fall behind on reviewing and retaining material in this class , which makes for very stressful pre-examination weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chang is really helpful, quite knowledgeable, and presents interesting studies that make you reevaluate human behaviors. However, the class is not very structured and there is not much supplemental material to go along with the class and the professor's lecture style can be boring at times. More summary slides would be helpful, as well as slides walking the students through each experiment. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked having the slides and the studies on Canvas, I thought that was really helpful. Also, I think Piazza was useful to answer our questions but also to see answers to what other students were asking. Having the midterm and final cover the first and second half of the course respectively made studying so much easier. I think the review sessions in class could be improved by going over material again instead of just having us come with questions. Although, I think there is merit to bringing our own questions, sometimes we haven't started studying for the exam and I think that we should maximize use of our time by making sure we are reviewing. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures can end up being very boring by the end just because we usually spend the whole time looking at study after study, which can get monotonous after a while especially in the late afternoon. I like that you dont need a lot of background in neuroscience to take this course although it is admittedly more difficult at first if you havent taken the human brain/a neuroscience course before. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Would have liked to know about more current experiments but I don't know if those even exist, they just all seemed quite dated. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the teaching staff are very accessible for questions and always willing to go back and further explain material that had been confusing to students. I also think it was very helpful to have the Piazza site set up during the second half of the semester for students to ask questions at any time and quickly receive detailed, written answers. I also appreciated having review sessions prior to each exam and, though I was originally doubtful, thought it was really interesting and worthwhile to hold the consciousness debate in-class. It is definitely the responsibility of the students to make sure they are staying engaged and learn the material in their own time since the only evaluations/grades are the one midterm and the final paper and exam. However, I see this as more of a strength than a weakness; students should be mature enough to manage their time accordingly, and this type of structure allows for more flexibility and less day-to-day stress throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, I liked how low workload the class was, but (can't believe I'm asking for this) I would like low-stakes weekly quizzes to help confirm learning so I consistently know what I am supposed to be learning.  Looking back, the class was too unstructured. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught really well. Professor Chang answers all questions and his slides are thorough. ",
            "\u00a0I really dont see any weakness in the structure of this class. The slides were detailed but also necessitated that you come to class and listen. Just the right amount of slides were covered each class, not too many but enough to have a lot of examples of ways to investigate each topic that we covered through causation and correlation. This was extremely helpful when studying for exams. The paper was very doable, and we were give lots of guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Steve Chang is a great instructor, and the TF is very kind and knowledgeable. Great course if you want to consider or already into neuroscience. Structured quite nicely as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I like the topics a lot  perhaps focus less on social and introduce something new? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very informative content that is well-communicated to students, slides are clear and concise, the exams are very fair and the Professor makes it clear what content is fair game and what is supplementary material. This was the first science class Ive taken at Yale as a non-science major, and this turned out to be hands-down one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeakness: there is not really any weakness, maybe just the fact that the only assignments throughout the term are the two midterms and the final paper so there is little room for error on any of these assignments ",
            "\u00a0Although the course grew more and more interesting as the material moved from lower-level to higher-level topics, I found that lectures grew increasingly repetitive. This might be partly due to the overarching style of each lecture: here's a study, here's the method/task (which is often very similar to many we've seen before, but with one or two small differences), here are some charts; wash rinse repeat. Prof. Chang clearly cares about his work and this material, and the subject can raise some thought-provoking questions; however, I think the course could be improved by periodically highlighting the more thought-provoking ideas and debates in the field. The final day of class was an \"open discussion on consciousness,\" and I thought it was really fun. Prof. Chang makes a point to be very open to feedback, which I very much appreciate. Looking back, I wish that we had held most lectures in a smaller roomafter the first day we moved to a larger lecture hall because of so many shoppers, but for most of the semester that hall was relatively emptier. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was good, but one thing that made the material hard to understand was that topics weren't presented with much linking structure. This was especially hard when it came to conceptualizing what brain areas did what, because I haven't taken any neuroanatomy, but is probably primarily because neuroscience itself hasn't developed clear frameworks where topics such as working memory, attentional control, etc. all fit into one schema. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot and the work load is pretty low. The course is extremely well organized and the exams are incredibly fair. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in neuroscience and cognition. You'll learn much about how the brain operates different levels of cognition and Professor Chang is an extremely kind and attentive lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. You don't need any neuroscience background, but try not to take this class with social neuro because exam dates/assignments tend to overlap. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great neuroscience / psych elective. Survey of cognitive neuroscience ideas and experimental paradigms. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I learned a great deal. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is reasonable since Prof. Chang only tests based on what we cover in class. I took this course with no prior experience with neuroscience or cognitive science and felt totally fine keeping pace with the course - Id say if you work hard, you really dont need to have prior knowledge in the subject area. It was totally worth taking, and Prof. Chang is really really helpful and kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I think this course provides key insights into the research findings that underly the main theories and facts of cognitive neuroscience. The course teaches critical thinking about experimental design, analysis and conclusions. The papers presented are very interesting, and sometimes conflict with one another in ways that make one question how well understood the brain actually is. However, be prepared to review on your own throughout the semester to stay on top of the material. There are no weekly assignments, which makes it easy to get behind if you are not diligent about going through lecture notes and internalizing the content. An alternative strategy is doing all of this reviewing in the days before the exam, but that is less effective and far more stressful. ",
            "\u00a0If the human brain interests you, this class will also have moments that make you say \"wow.\" However, the organization is nothing like the Human Brain, and understanding lectures that you failed to attend is a major hassle at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to people interested in neuroscience and need a class with lower workload day to day. There are only 3 grades, which is why there isnt too much work normally but it also puts a lot of pressure to do well on those two exams and paper so you should study a lot for those exams. Im sure there could be some more interesting courses because this class was primarily about looking at research done in cognitive neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class is pretty straightforward and the lectures offer great insights into key cognitive neuroscience experiments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. There is a very large amount of material covered and I found it to be very interesting and rewarding, without a lot of stress. I also thought the teaching staff was great and very encouraging and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, if you're a neuroscience student on track for the major, I don't think you have much of choice, but if you are just looking for a science credit like me, this probably wouldn't be my first option, but it's adequate if you don't just want a gut, and you're interested in neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Cognitive neuroscience is a fascinating field and the experiments discussed are really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a very good class for someone who wants to better understand how basic human cognitive processes may be represented in the brain. Its not too difficult, but you do get to really dive into the studies and break down what the important graphs and results mean. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Amazing course and you build an extremely strong foundation in experimental methods and interpreting results. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure. You learn a lot about the brains cognitive mechanisms without having to be swamped with work throughout the semester. All the course content is well structured and presented in a clear, concise manner that facilitates learning. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this class! Prof is super passionate about his field but is not unapproachable or oddly strict--he's super funny and kind and likes to make lots of corny jokes. He also makes the class very fun and tries to reduce the amount of time he spends droning on about silly things, which is helpful. Probably the best part--he is VERY good at answering questions directly and quickly, so any confusions you might have at any point can quickly be put to rest. The effort you put in matches the results you get out, so although it is a lot of information, just put your head down and learn it all and you'll see the results you want. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you had a motivating reason to learn more about neural processes, circuitry, and methodology used in the field. I don't that that it's necessarily a natural follow-up to Human Brain, for example, and there may be other Nsci courses that speak to your interests more or are more engaging. Knowing now what most of the material is like, I don't think I would recommend it to my past self, though I'm glad to have learned the material nowat times, it felt a little dry, but (this is weird to say) I found studying for the midterm and final to be really cool, as all the different but somewhat repetitive pieces \"clicked\" together in a new way. If you do take it, make the most of it by getting to know Prof. Chang! ",
            "\u00a0I would, because while it was difficult, it's worth the effort you have to put into it. It gave me a better understanding of neuroscience in a way that connected to my other cognitive science studies. "
