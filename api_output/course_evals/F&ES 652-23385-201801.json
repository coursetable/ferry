            "\u00a0I developed a much stronger understanding of how trees grow, how wood forms, and how wood functions both in a living tree and as a building material. I also now have a working knowledge of wood identification and dendrochronology. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of wood physiology and anatomy that I did not possess before taking the class. This included wood ID and the fundamentals of dendrochronology. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Overall this course struck a good balance between field excursions, lab work, projects, and lecture. I really appreciated how much we covered and how readily applicable I found the material to my other courses and professional skills. \r\nThe microanatomy module really blew everyone away (in a good way!)... wood is amazing and seeing how it's put together really aids understanding of plant physiology and wood products. The dendrochronology field trip and project was also both fun and a great experience applying skills with a real-world deliverable. The lectures and field trips in mechanical properties of wood and wood products seemed to really engage the MFs, particularly getting to have in-depth conversations with professionals in different wood-related industries (e.g. milling, ship building, urban tree harvesting, musical instruments). I also appreciated the group format for the final exam and project... this enabled us to answer much more complex and interesting questions than if we'd been working alone. \r\nWeaknesses: It would have been great to share this experience with more students! Pretty much every MF and MFS that I talked to would have liked to have taken the course if it had fit in their schedule better. ",
            "\u00a0The class sometimes felt a bit slow and disjointed. I think changing the scheduling could make a difference. Mainly, if the Wood ID midterm were earlier in the semester, right after the Wood ID unit of the course, then the structure of the initial part of the semester would have felt more solidly foundational. Nevertheless, I really appreciated the relaxed nature of this class. It was fun to be given the space to explore the structure of wood and to learn about it from so many different angles. The field trips were great, and I liked all the hands-on lab aspects of the class. It's refreshing to have a class like this to balance other lecture and discussion classes. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to wood ID and physiology. However, it's pretty surface level and could probably go more in depth, especially with the dendrochronology sections. Also, it would be really great if there was more time spent on the wood products industry. We spent very little time discussing engineered wood products and wood product manufacturing on larger commercial scales. While the smaller, niche wood products we discuss and visited are interesting, they are not likely the type of wood manufacturers we will  be engaging with as professional foresters.\r\n\r\nIt would have been really great to learn more about how different species and grades of wood are utilized on commercial scales. This could include touring Hull sawmill, and other pulp/paper mills in the northeast. "

            "\u00a0Take it! This is everything you wish you knew about wood. You learn where it came from (microanatomy tree ID), what the history of the stand/region was (dendrochronology), how processing the wood effects its mechanical properties, how we use wood in both traditional and modern applications, and overall just gain a greater confidence and appreciation for trees and timber. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone studying forests or plants should take this class! I hope that more MF students take it in the future. It's really valuable to have a thorough understanding of wood, as well as to be familiar with the growth of trees. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for anyone pursuing the MF/MFs degrees, and honestly should be mandatory. No one should complete a graduate-level forestry degree and not understand the fundamentals of wood, as this directly pertains to how we manage forests and sell trees. "
