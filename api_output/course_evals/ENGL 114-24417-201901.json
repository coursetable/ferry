            "\u00a0I learned skills of writing more clearly as well as scholarly research and public speaking. I gained immense knowledge on how protest movements and social movements work in general and different approaches to creating social change.

            "\u00a0I liked the overall structure of the class and enjoyed the challenges of trying to answer the essay prompts. However, in the middle part of the semester, I found the readings to not be as engaging as those in the beginning or the end. The paper topics drifted away from the readings, which was perfectly okay with me but also made me less inclined to read them closely. ",
