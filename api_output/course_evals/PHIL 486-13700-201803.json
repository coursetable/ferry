            "\u00a0I gained a very good understanding of Kant's later philosophy and its relation to German Idealism. ",

            "\u00a0The course is wonderfully structured, giving you the majority of semester to read through the CPJ, but adding on segments by the German Idealist responders at the end. In addition to seeing the perspective of Kant's contemporaries and successors, Khurana has spent a lot of time designing the syllabus. Secondary sources, both in the analytic and continental tradition, are provided along with the reading every week to give you a broader understanding of the text. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include excellent teaching, grading, and selection of reading; the supplementary resources were also very good. \r\nPapers and their timeline could have been discussed at greater length. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I initially came to this course without much knowledge of Kant and his project in the CPJ. However, with a leap of faith, I entered the course and found myself pleasantly surprised. My perspective on the text altered each week because the text gives so much. Kant does more than what he seems to be doing at first sight--more than just aesthetics and teleology. He arrives at the foundations of philosophy and the springboard of future philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Kant's third Critique is a truly fascinating work. On the one hand, Kant manages to give a very appealing account of aesthetics and teleology in the context of his theoretical and practical philosophy. On the other hand, Kant seems to give the basis for transcending his own system at the same stroke. Among other things, the seminar focused on the question of whether the gulf between nature and freedom that was opened in Kant's earlier work was successfully bridged over in the third critique. Professor Khurana has a deep understanding of both the intricacies of the text as well as the overall scope and aim of the book. The discussions in the seminars were very well regulated and focused on interesting questions without drifting away from the central themes of the text. I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in aesthetics, German Idealism or contemporary continental philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course, or anything Professor Khurana chooses to teach, for that matter. "
