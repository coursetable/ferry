It seems the majority of students did not want the R content in the course, so the final content of the course ended up being too basic and hence disappointing. I tried to incorporate R as much as possible even after the R content was removed following the midterm evaluations. However, since it was no longer the focus of the course, there were less materials (i.e. example scripts) provided to develop these skills, so I often ended up working on the weekly assignments in Excel, which I was already very familiar with. I did really enjoy the Healy chapters and the accompanying exercises. One suggestion is to have more options available for the weekly assignments given the large differences in background. I appreciated the weeks when Healy chapters were available as an assignment option, but I also think it would be useful to have the option of workshopping a figure from your own work that could ultimately feed into the final project.

            "\u00a0Strength: interesting makeover assignments, good use of piazza, clear feedback from instructors, great guest lecturers.\r\nWeakness: lectures are dry, assignments are posted either too late or too early (mostly on Tuesday instead of Monday, and once assigned Saturday and due Monday), sometimes chaotic illustrations (there are sometimes contradictory pdf and docx documents, and little guidance on draft #1), neglect the needs of students who know how to code and want to learn more.

The short turnaround time discouraged thoughtful responses. A due date over the weekend was also not ideal. \r\n\r\nI also wish the final project assignment would have remained consistent. When the project requirements changed halfway through, I felt the work I had done to comply with the old requirements would no longer be recognized.\r\n\r\nOverall, I learned a lot in the course and appreciated the chance to develop my visualization skills. ",

The class size was large, but through group work and talking with other students, I don't think this significantly took anything away from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Make-Up Mondays were a useful class exercise to apply some of the principles we learned in class. However, instead of addressing a few examples with the whole class, having small group feedback would be more useful with the professors listening in and providing extra commentary. The guest lecturers, particularly David Roberts, was also a fascinating talk into journalism and data visualization. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the final project - I enjoyed making a visualization based on a data set, although I think refining what you are all looking for in terms of this final project would be helpful. I also think capping the class to 16 would help provide more hands-on and teaching lessons regarding R or other data visualization techniques would be great. I think the presentations were pretty basic and did not feel very helpful to how I could actually learn to be better at data visualization. I think more group work in class on these types of visualizations would be the most beneficial. I think the guest lecturers were interesting but not always the most applicable to us necessarily and perhaps all of them were not the best use of our class time ",
            "\u00a0The online R textbook and the Williams book are both great! The guest speakers often gave us introductions to the data viz principles we'd already focused on and often didn't really add much to the conversation. Either get rid of/reduce the number of guest speakers or give them more information about what we've covered before they arrive. (Also, don't make us buy books for speakers who are only in class for 1 day.) I liked Jenn and Simon's lectures but felt like we could have covered more ground or gone into more depth by the end of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0The guest speakers were excellent, and each of them added value to my experience and showed me many positive examples from professionals in the field. I think that the expectations for the final project could have been more structured to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0Include more interesting content in the lectures ",
            "\u00a0The course should have a clear focus - for example, mastering Tableau. That way, over the semester, students will learn how to use a specific software. Each class should involve a lab workshop, where students could follow along and build new skills. ",
            "\u00a0I could certainly tell it was a new course because the class structure varied a lot. The guest speakers were very useful and interesting. There could have been more support for students to learn the program or technical skills involved. In Renewable Energy Project Finance, there were regular sessions, maybe once every other week, where TAs walked students through a tutorial on the computer, trying to teach a new skill. This might require a larger TA team, but it could be useful to have something similar for this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course were in it's applied value. I will be using many of the principles I learned in the class for years to come in my own work. I think a weakness was in the organization of the class. It wasn't always clear when/how assignments were supposed to be done. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We had phenomenal speakers and it was fun to be able to explore our own dataset for the final project. Also, Jenn and Simon were ALWAYS willing to go above and beyond to help - which is truly appreciated. \r\nWeaknesses: The class moved a bit too slow at times and didn't feel like it had too much direction/continuity at times. The point allocation for Makeover Mondays felt a bit arbitrary, and also a bit repetitive at times (although it is a good skill to have to train ourselves to think about how to improve graphs). I wish the R segment wasn't scrapped, because I was looking forward to learning that. ",
            "\u00a0-The discussions in class about makeovers were useful. It would be helpful to analyze more bad graphics or good graphics. \r\n-Message Box never really made sense to me, and I read the PDF. The difference between some of the categories never quite became clear. I did appreciate that there was instruction on how to construct a narrative. \r\n-The class should be taught like a GIS class- short lecture and then a lab session where we all work on a software tutorial in class. One 30-minute Tableau or Excel tutorial is not enough. I pretty much just had to teach myself the software which was very difficult and time-consuming. The class needs to be a lot smaller for this to work, however. ",

            "\u00a0Most of the lectures, and guest lectures, were interesting and added value. A few of the lectures, however, didn't really add a whole lot to the class, such as the one on Excel. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the ability to pursue our own final project topic, and the freedom/flexibility around this assignment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt very disorganized. Many of the lectures felt unnecessary and repetitive of one another (especially from some of the guest lecturers). Some of the lectures additionally felt out of order (e.g. an \"Excel 101\" halfway through the course, when this would have been much more helpful in the first weeks of class). Homework assignment expectations were often either too high (8+ hours to complete for students unfamiliar with R) or too low (e.g. felt like \"busy work\" that took less than 30 minutes to complete). ",
            "\u00a0The course spent quite a bit of time discussing things that you should do when creating a graphic but didn't spend enough time describing the tools introduced in the class and when to use them. It would have been nice after each topic if the Professor had spent a moment describing the limiting factors of a given tool, when to use it, and the expected product that you would be able to get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course would greatly benefit from a reduction in size and the addition of a lab requirement, wherein students have a chance to practice and develop technical skills before doing the homework. This class should have max 20-25 students in it, and each student should be required to meet with the teaching team at least twice a semester. Tableau is incredibly useful but at times this class felt more self-taught, i.e. attendance at lecture wasn't necessary. By incorporating a lab section, faculty will be able to delve more deeply into the software and students will benefit more. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organized, but as I mentioned above, the main weakness for me was the shift in focus from R to Excel. Perhaps it could be a follow up course to Intro R to ensure that the students have an appropriate level of background to learn the programming language? The weekly assignments were also a weakness as I wished there had been more flexibility in working on independent projects in lieu of the provided makeover. \r\n\r\nI did really enjoy the guest speakers.

            "\u00a0The strength is the project-based approach (weekly assignments). A definite weakness was the size of the class and content of the lectures. I think that the portion of lectures designed to teach design principles should be less theoretical. Looking at various examples with a smaller group and discussing issues might have been more effective. "
