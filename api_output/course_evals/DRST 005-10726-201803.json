            "\u00a0I learned how to read and analyze old western texts discussing history, politics or political theory. I think I became a better reader and learned how to have insights into these books. I also did a lot of writing and improved slightly as a writer, although not as much as I think I could have. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to extract the most important details from history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a fair amount about Greek and Roman history, and some valuable context for modern political thought. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about close reading, historical and literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze the historical and political aspects of a work ",
            "\u00a0Connections among and between time periods in history, antitheses ",
            "\u00a0Through the lens of some of the most influential and important books regarding history and politics, we learned how to think critically about what they meant to us, to analyze both the characters' and the authors' point of view, and to understand different authors' points of view on politics, the role of the human in society, what it means to rule, etc. We tackled the big-picture questions each author presented. ",
            "\u00a0HnP was probably my favourite DS course because of how incredibly well we were able to see the big picture of Greek and Roman history after getting through the entire semester. When later authors start making references to events covered by earlier authors, and when recurring political themes and patterns manifest themselves in different time periods and geographical regions, one can really see the value of having such a strong grasp of the content covered by HnP. What I enjoyed most about the texts we covered was the moralistic lens that many authors adopted, which made looking at ancient history continually important in order to apply political, moral, social and historical lessons to modern society today. ",
            "\u00a0A good bit of history, yes, and a good bit of political philosophy - but, much more profoundly, an unrivaled experience interacting hands-on with primary texts, learning how to read between the lines and better articulate what often felt excitingly like novel ideas. ",

            "\u00a0The strength was in all the books we read and their incredible rigor and depth. The weakness was our seminars. We barely got anywhere in most discussions, talking about the books in limited depth and nearly no breadth. They're such difficult, important reads that seminars should be lively and engaging, bringing out ideas and trying to understand most of the author has to say, yet we often struggled in class and had little help from Professor Robinson. I feel like my understanding of the books we read was behind most of my DS peers for this reason. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was an overall great course. The books were quite dense, but aside from that, this was a solid course. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could use a bigger emphasis on the modern implications of both the history and the political philosophy we read. Maybe my way of thinking is contrary to the premise of DS, but I dont see much good in studying these works if we dont thinm about the wisdom that can be gleaned from them in a modern context. ",
            "\u00a0- ",
            "\u00a0Readings could be better selected. Some selections (like the part about the astrology of twins in City of God) just seem a little redundant. No complaints about the volume of reading though, it is manageable with effort and is also one of the strengths of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Less student engagement than other DS courses, but overall good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) We do a bunch of reading, so we come out of this course with a large breadth of knowledge of history and political thought. 2) We also go in depth quite a bit (obviously, since it's an intro course, not enough; yet DS does give a significant amount of depth to these books based on the 2 seminars + 1 lecture course). 3) You are with a bunch of peers who love this and have had amazing experiences that you haven't, and teachers who love this, and learning not just from the books but from the students and teachers is one of the best parts of this course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) Whereas in Literature and Philosophy we are able to do a lot of the whole readings (in Literature, they are novels and fiction so they move faster; in Philosophy, they are small books jammed with a lot of info, so you will occasionally have 8 pages of Epicurus to read), in History and Political Thought we often read fragments of the books, which meant that we jumped around a lot and sometimes did not have a big picture view of the author and his point of view. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I read the text selections without understanding the context of why they were selected - and it can get rather disorienting to plunge into disparate events with no sense of the big picture. I would appreciate a more technical, dry overview of the entirety of Roman and Greek history and political development/structure perhaps at some point in the semester to help us understand context better! I feel like my historical knowledge of Greek and Roman history is at this point just made up of quick snapshots of distinctive incidents and characters. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course - the sheer quantity of content covered - is also its biggest weakness. It feels transcendent to walk away from one's first semester having seen the styles and philosophies of Herodotus, Plutarch, Livy (and so many others), but one must be careful to keep the readings from becoming superficial skimmings, and the incredible overview from turning into a tedious slog. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would, because of the great books we read in DS. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend this to another student. If you have a pure interest in classical history or political thought for its own sake then this class is obviously fantastic. If you, like me, derive your interest in those things from a passion for more modern issues, then this class is still useful, but there are also other classes in which you may have to take fewer long walks from content to application. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have learnt to think about history and politics in a new way. Plus, I have never been really interested in these subjects, but being able to read classical texts about them in such great depth has made me very interested in learning more about them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about Western history. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. Take DS. It will change your life. You read a bunch of cools texts, learn from cool professors, and have an amazing community from which to draw for the rest of your life. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely will! DS really helps you think about everything. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend - with a few caveats.\r\n1. There are lots of books. Enough time will be spent reading that you will begin to seriously contemplate reading posture. \r\nIf you love books, and love the act of reading itself - not just the information books provide, but the very process of magically decoding words - D.S. is for you. If, conversely, you like facts but find reading a bit of a chore, D.S. might be slightly agonizing. We don't examine the facts; we examine how the authors thought about the facts.\r\n2. There is a good amount of writing - but the essays aren't assigned to improve one's writing mechanics so much as to force one to think about the works. For this they work spectacularly well. I'd recommend drafting some sort of essay for every work covered in class - it will lead to a much richer experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Directed Studies to any student with an interest in the Western canon or in any of its subjects. "
