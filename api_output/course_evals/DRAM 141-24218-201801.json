            "\u00a0I thought that the workload was definitely appropriate: there were enough cases to both fuel our class discussions and few enough cases to allow us to spend time on each one. The cases Joan picked are some of the most significant cases in the world of Law and the Arts, and since taking the class, I have encountered them several times in scholarly articles and in the news. ",
            "\u00a0The volume of reading was challenging at times, but it was never overwhelming. It made sense to assign this much reading as Joan needed to build foundational knowledge for many students with diverse backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings. It was a lovely variety of material. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like all of the readings were important to facilitating class discussion and I liked the balance between actually cases, the sources upon which the cases were based, and then articles about the cases. ",
            "\u00a0There would sometimes be a little too much content to get through in the week, especially when the cases were dense. It took me a while to train myself that I didn't need to deep dive into every single case the same way we did once we got into the contracts portion. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Joan clearly thought everything out carefully, and I felt that the class built on itself. She did a wonderful job--especially in the exams--of incorporating everything we had learned in such a way as to make the connections between them clear. I thought that the PowerPoints were well-organized and were informative without being overbearing, and I also felt that she structured our class discussions productively and efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far and away the best logical sequencing and most organized syllabus that I have experienced as a first-year theater manager. The material scaffolded step by step to build a solid foundation in a complex subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Really easy to follow and when there were changes made they were clearly articulated. ",
            "\u00a0Logically organized, which made it easy to see how concept built upon each other. ",
            "\u00a0The organization was thorough and we always knew where everything was. "

            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes at YSD because of Joan. You can tell how passionate and knowledgable she is about the topics and she makes you genuinely excited about things like copyright infringement, which I never thought I would say. ",
            "\u00a0Joan is an excellent professor with an incredible background that makes her teaching style as well as her anecdotes insightful and meaningful in the classroom. I found Law and the Arts to be particularly meaningful for my future and I look forward to learning more about many of the topics we talked about in class! ",
            "\u00a0Joan first and foremost made everyone feel valued, and most importantly, made us really excited about the material. She took the time to answer our questions, whether they were concerned with factual material or with hypothetical situations, and she also had a clear structure to how to approach the cases that has since helped me approach reading cases. Each class was perfectly timed, and I walked away understanding the key points of each topic. ",
            "\u00a0It is very apparent that Joan has built and refined this course over many years. Her passion, expertise, and case selections made the course extremely enjoyable and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of my favorite professors I have had at YSD. Her passion and knowledge are evident in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Channick was an incredible teacher and did a great job keeping us on track but also indulging our hypotheticals. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely knowledgeable, made self accessible to students, presented material in interesting manner. ",
            "\u00a0Joan is excellent at teaching this particular course. She kept us sharp and didn't allow any slips in understanding. It was an honor to learn from her. "

            "\u00a0I felt that this class had both practical and theoretical value. I was challenged to understand the governing principles behind topics such as copyright and contracts, and I also was challenged to apply what I had learned on the exams in a critical and argumentative way. I feel that the skills I built both as a reader and writer of law have helped me in my other classes, particularly with essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0The material is critical to my intentions to pursue a career in theater management. I appreciated the perspective Joan gave of understanding the thresholds at which point I should seek legal counsel. This was the most challenging and rewarding class of my first year in the TM department. While this is not a subject matter in which I particularly excel, I was able to take large strides in my ability to interpret and use legal jargon. I felt the class \"moved my needle\" of expertise farther than any other course this year. ",
            "\u00a0While I do not have the strongest legal mind, I feel so much better able to read, decipher, and retain information from  legal documents. ",
            "\u00a0Really great  as a Yale College student I'm also excited to incorporate what I learned into my senior essay. ",

            "\u00a0I had a conversation with a playwright encouraging him to take this class. Unfortunately he seemed turned off by the volume of reading, but it gave me the idea that it might be useful to assign YSD students to do a teach-back project where they share concepts learned in this course with fellow artists at YSD. This may not seem feasible within the constraints of this course, but if there was ever an opportunity to do this, I think it could help many people at the school. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe a classroom in which we could all better sit around the table? Otherwise, nothing. "
