            "\u00a0Only some knowledge about how to apply a very specific model that is not really applicable to the real world. A ton about how to manipulate ugly equations with lots of exponents that become a huge mess. And taking derivatives of those. Like, I got some fundamentals about the economics of space, sure. But I could have learned so much more if the content had been more broadly applicable. I mean, the model said that some of the highest amenity area in the country is Northern Arizona... have you ever been to Northern Arizona? There's nothing there!! Like yeah it's warm in the winter and not humid, but I don't think anyone thinks it's such a great place to live. So I struggled to stay engaged when the material seemed so theoretical and unrelated to real life. If you're going to teach material that's unrelated to real life, then why not make the equations less messy (like come up with something better than Dixit-Stiglitz so that we don't have so many sigmas everywhere) so that we can focus on learning the material instead of moving around the exponents.

            "\u00a0This is  a good application of the concepts introduced in intermediate micro. I really enjoyed learning more about trade models and how populations distribute in space. A course unlike all other economics courses offered at Yale ",

            "\u00a0Costas is nice. That's a strength. But the course is not well organized, I don't see how you'd use any of what you learn in real life, there are a lot of typos on the slides, the problem sets take a lot of energy to wrangle with the algebra, and for Heaven's sake, GET RID OF THE GIS COMPONENT!! Like, we had to make these maps in GIS, except that GIS is really complex software, and I'd never used it before. Jack, one of the TAs, gave us an exceedingly brief walkthrough of how to do one problem, but if you got behind at any point you were screwed because he was really impatient. And then he made a youtube video for how to do the other GIS problem, but he did it with an outdated version of QGIS, so it didn't help at all. So I spent like a whole day trying to do the GIS problem, learned nothing except a lot of wrangling with GIS, and then I still didn't get the points for it because I did something wrong. The GIS parts of the problem sets added no value to the course whatsoever and made me want to drop it. Please please please get rid of them. And in general, there was too much discussion of the research. Like if there's ever been a course that was a professor teaching his research, this is it. So unless you're interested in the exact same research, you'll likely never use what you learn in this class again. I actually learned something relevant from Conor, the grad student from Australia who came in and gave a guest lecture. Please have him select the curriculum for next year. ",
            "\u00a0Not a terribly interesting course. The majority of the material is learning how an economic model of space works; the model is Prof. Arkolakis' own, and the course mostly consists of him showing us slides regarding the math used to derive his model. ",

            "\u00a0Maybe more problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fairly low-work, three problem sets, midterm and final. You will have to work on the problem sets as the lectures are more theory-based and the problem sets are similar to other economics problem sets (some proofs, some computation). The exams are straightforward. The professor is an expert in the field. ",
            "\u00a0It was disorganized sometimes, but overall I really enjoyed it. Professor Arkolakis was helpful. Problem sets should have been more frequent. "

            "\u00a0Nope nope nope... I hoped it would improve since last year was the first year the course was taught, but it did not. At least, not to a satisfactory level. The model is annoying to learn, it feels fake and not related to real life (like a one good economy? Seriously?), but it's still a ton of algebraic and exponential wrangling just for the sake of wrangling. Eduardo was a brutal grader... one wrong assumption = no points. It seemed like he was looking for how to take off as many points as possible instead of for ways we could succeed. If you happen to totally fall in love with the model used and feel compelled to perform further research on it, then go for it, but otherwise, you're just in for a lot of headbanging and no learning. There are plenty of better 400-level econs out there, and if you're doing econ+math, this is less work than 351 for sure, but that's about all it has going for it. Yeah, it wasn't an absolute ton of work, but the work we did do seemed very pointless. So I can't really find a reason to recommend this course. Also the final was much much more difficult than the midterm... don't expect to get any equations provided on the final, and do expect to have to remember exactly the equations used in various models on the slides if you want to have any shot at getting points on the final.
