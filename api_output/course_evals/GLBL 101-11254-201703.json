            "\u00a0This is a fantastic intro course, both to the study of global affairs and to Yale. We study an overview of current and historical global topics in an engaging, practical way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about currently topics in Global Affairs (briefly) as each section was a different topic. I also was able to further engage with these topics in discussion sections in which we could debate and discuss topics such as the rise of China or relevance of Big Data or Development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about many different aspects of the global political sphere - there were MANY different topics covered in this class. ",
            "\u00a0An overall view of what is happening around the world currently. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me to confirm my interest in pursuing Global Affairs here and assisted in my search for a specific focus. It was a great introductory class and I feel I got a lot out of it academically as well as personally. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broad knowledge of current global issues, as well as multiple insights on possible solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of most major world issues through this course, particularly those of Iraq and Afghanistan. One of my favorite parts of the course is that Emma invites guest speakers, whether they're World Fellows or other Yale professors. This helped me get firsthand insight on world issues, and figure out which professors I might be interested in taking a course with in future terms. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview of topics affecting the world. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about a broad range of topics, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to nuclear politics and philanthropy in China. I got a taste of everything that exists in the world of foreign affairs and was taught by some of the best lecturers at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0really interesting stuff about the world ",
            "\u00a0The course focused a lot on the Middle East--which is definitely important right now as far as interstate/regional conflicts, I won't deny that--but skirted other regions (Africa hardly touched on, Asia somewhat touched on but really only in the realm of China, Europe for a hot sec, etc) with a smattering of some somewhat random topics like humanitarian aid (as seen in the Middle East) and big data. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be informed in topics that are affecting the global climate that I might otherwise not focus on through the news. I was taught how to engage with others to try and reach understandings and adopt new perspectives in arguments that I may not have initially agreed with. I also learned how critical global service is as a moral obligation in being a human being. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general knowledge of a wide variety of issues throughout the world, from the Iraq War to Chinese Philanthropy to Big Data. I also learned how to write an effective policy memo. It was incredibly interesting to get short introductions into different of subject matters from experts in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I had no real experience with Global Affairs, and really World History in general before taking this course. For me the learning curve was high, but I came away with a far better understanding of how the world works and how the decisions of one country can impact another. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the recent history of the world including The Middle East, China, and the European Union. I learned to write a policy memo, and how to thing critically about long term global policies. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to learn a great deal about the Middle East, Brexit, China, and world epidemics such as Ebola. As many of my classmates have mentioned, the first half of the course definitely places a heavy emphasis on the Middle East which makes sense seeing that Professor Sky's expertise lies in Iraq. Although this was extremely enlightening and thought-provoking, I wish we had had the opportunity to explore other areas of the world in further detail. ",
            "\u00a0At the end of this course you will have been introduced to all emerging and pertinent issues of global and American concern. ",

            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of relevant current events topics, specifically with a particularly deeper understanding of Middle Eastern conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0GLBL 101 gives you a taste of huge issues in the modern history  eg. the Iraq War, Ebola Crisis, Brexit. The way that it does it is through different guest speakers that are experts in the field. This can be a good or bad thing because it's really great and helpful to hear insights from such cool people, but once you really start getting into the topic, the lecture is over and you may never see the speaker again. If you truly want a 'gateway' into it, perhaps to spark your love for a certain topic, or just be a more aware person, then this class would be great. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength and weakness of this class was its rotating professors and topics. It was nice to switch away from the less interesting teachers but I wish I could've had the good teachers more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The guest speakers range from interesting to exceptional, and Emma Sky is a powerhouse. The work is very manageable (you need to come to lectures though). Assuming you get a good TA, it's a fantastic class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If it's not an area that you're very familiar with, you might have to do some outside research on some of the topics discussed in order to understand the context. Sometimes the lectures just jump in without giving perhaps all the context necessary. ",
            "\u00a0As an introductory course it does a very good job at giving students a flavor of the Jackson Institute and the topics and Professors it as to offer. It does not go into much detail about any of the topics apart from our writing of essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of interesting information covered. Emma Sky was AMAZING, and it was incredible to learn about her life.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often it felt unnecessary to go to lectures. The readings often didn't feel important. All that seemed to matter were talking in discussion and turning in the midterm and final essays, which made it difficult to want to participate in and attend lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The different lecturers make the sessions different every weak, but some were quite boring, while some were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the broad range of subjects and professors who gave lectures.  It provided a great opportunity to plan future studies.  However, a few of the lectures seemed out of place compared to the overall structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is very flexible, which means that you can learn and read articles about world issues without feeling the pressure of potentially being tested on what you're reading. You're learning for the sake of learning, rather than taking notes and memorizing facts. The broad range of topics also means that you can figure out what you're most interested in before honing in on a particular global issue in a later course. The policy papers that we write for our midterm and final also are great learning tools in themselves, and rather enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The content of this course is, to some degree, based on what the guest lecturer for that day wants to focus on. While lectures over Iraq, Afghanistan, and China were helpful, I felt like ones on more obscure topics weren't. I would've rather gotten an in-depth lecture on Israel-Palestine, for example, but it wasn't in anyone's expertise. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were not very substantial, particularly the ones about the public sphere. Maybe add some different speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is a great way to learn about topics in global affairs from some of the world's experts. Although it is a lecture, it feels more personal and interactive than others I have taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved if the policy memos and essays were not due the same day. ",
            "\u00a0strength:professor is awesome\r\nweakness: section is good if you have a good TF, the TFs are really cool because students like you and are in the Jackson Institute ",
            "\u00a0This course perfectly combines world fellows with Yale teachers to expose us to different subjects and topics we would otherwise not take classes in. The lectures are brilliant while providing a non-overbearing workload for an introductory global affairs course. The essays force us to be critical and creative in making solutions to global issues and understanding the experience of the other. My only suggestion I could think of is that the final peace simulation should be a little more involved with what we learned throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The wide breath of the class makes it so you will find at least one thing that interests you. Emma Sky is a great lecturer but the class revolves around guest lecturers, which are hit or miss for the most part. The hits definitely make up for the misses.The class could be improved through more insightful essay questions. The questions asked felt vague and vain. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated that this course brought in guest speakers, making the lectures very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice if the course had a bit more structure to it. Although the Middle East portion was well-organized, the second half of the semester could sometimes become a mingle of random topics thrown together. ",
            "\u00a0As with all big lectures, student-professor engagement is limited. The class does a good job of providing breadth in all key fields of interest in the context of global affairs. ",
            "\u00a0The design of this course is both its biggest strength and weakness. Because it feautres guest lecturers, the quality of the lectures varied a ton. Some were super engaging and interesting while others were incredibly boring. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings were particularly excellent and for the most part helped center the discussion and understanding of the different topics. I did think that some of the section discussions were often too bland or general and that some of the lectures only offered an overall explanation of the issues at hand. Though I understand that many of these topics could not be properly dealt with in 75 minutes, I think leaving less time for questions might help amplify understanding. I also think some of the speakers who spoke on specific or minute subject matter struggled at times to connect the topic back to some overarching issue. Perhaps less speakers with more lectures on similar subject matter might be better. Belabbes Benkredda and Jason Lyall were particularly good. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths include the diversity of topics and expertise of lecturers. Weaknesses include a general shallow understanding/coverage of course material. I think there is perhaps too great of an emphasis on the study of the Middle East. It also seemed at times that the readings for the courses had little to do with each other or the prompts for the midterm or final paper. ",
            "\u00a0incredible lecturers and TFs ",
            "\u00a0The course allows for no deep engagement with a particular topic. The most in-depth we ever got would be the Iraq war, but that was mostly from reading Emma Sky's book, The Unraveling, which we only had one class to discuss. The reason that this didn't frustrate me, was because this class is called a gateway and it delivers to that name. I came in knowing that I would be getting a taste of varied topics, and this is what I got - I personally liked this but it is definitely not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing and the course material is very interesting and fun to learn about. In addition, we had the opportunity to learn from a number of influential professors across all of the different fields of global affairs at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers were interesting but made it difficult to understand exactly what the curriculum of the course was and what material we were meant to be focusing on. ",
            "\u00a0It covers the problems in the Middle East very well and extensively, though more time could be allocated to the rise of China in the global arena. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the guest lecture format. Around half of the classes are taught by guest lecturers. Some of the lectures were boring and somewhat unhelpful, yet others were riveting. There are some that I remember vividly as I write this review.\r\n\r\nThe left-leaning political bias was evident. It didn't get too much in the way of learning (and was ameliorated in part by certain lecturers who'd admit their biases), but I think the course would be best without it. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Emma Sky and all her amazingness, and all the teaching fellows! Also, all the guest lecturers were incredibly interesting and open to student discourse. \r\nweaknesses: no stable consistency to follow throughout the semester for academic cohesiveness; very broad ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was overall perfect as is. I enjoyed learning about a variety of issues and applying my knowledge into essays. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting. The rotation of lecturers and topics makes it a fun and exciting class. This can be a double-edged sword though because the lack of continuity makes it easy for students to skip a class without consequence. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches you to look closely at the intertwined histories and cultures of the Middle East countries therefore looking past the surface judgments and assumptions made based on few facts and biases. \r\n\r\nHowever, the reading assigned for each class is very lengthy and not very useful. The reading is useful to be prepared for class, but not necessary to receive high marks on the papers, especially as there are no exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me insight into various aspects of global affairs and covered the defence, development and diplomacy components. A strength of this class was that a lecturer who was an expert on each topic spoke to us every week. However, I wish that the topics were connected better. I thoroughly enjoyed the class despite this though. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught primarily by guest lecturers, which was both a strength and a weakness. Most of the guest lecturers were engaging and lectured on interesting and important topics. However, a few lecturers were boring or brought topics that seemed too specific for an overview course. \r\n\r\nAlso, my TF (Patricia Austria) was absolutely amazing and super knowledgeable, and all of the other TFs seemed equally good. ",
            "\u00a0Very little common thread between lectures and didn't have enough relation to the essays. Felt more like an optional lecture series than a class. ",
            "\u00a0I think there is a strength in having so many guest lecturers and being introduced to so many different instructors a part of the Global Affairs major, but it also makes for a convoluted course on what exactly the course is focused on. That said, I still really enjoyed class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Really only take this course if you want an easy social science credit. If you actually care about international relations and want to learn don't bother. Most of the lectures are poorly organized, especially the ones given by the world fellows. The essays questions for the midterm and final also looked like they had been written after 30 seconds of thought. The grading was pretty good though and there was very little work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is a light workload and the lectures are really interesting for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. Especially if you're interested in studying anything to do with global affairs, history, etc., but even if not. It's a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in Global Affairs this is an interesting course to hear from great speakers. Also, Professor Sky is brilliant and has so much insight to life and on topics regarding international relations. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to even someone just slightly interested in global affairs. It gives a great survey and introduces a number of guest lecturers who themselves teach classes on campus, and covers a wide variety of topics in a way that nevertheless makes each feel deeply interesting. The professor is incredible and the TF's are each amazing. In all a phenomenal class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course.  This was a great opportunity to receive lectures by many of Yale's best professors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're curious about whether you're interested in Global Affairs or simply want to read more about world issues, this is a great class. Its low-commitment means that you can actually focus on learning for the sake of learning. I genuinely enjoyed this class, both because Emma Sky is an amazing professor and because I was exposed to a wide range of visiting lecturers, all of whom have fascinating life experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Easy introduction to Global Affairs, so yes if you're interested in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course. It makes you a better and more aware human, and we need more of these in the world right now. ",

Workload is very chill though, with readings (but a lot/most? people considered them optional), and/but the only grades are the midterm/final papers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are just curious or searching for a possible passion, this course covers such a wide range of major issues, that you are due to find at least one that resonates. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to every Yale student; as our economy globalists, it is so important to understand global politics, and the history of current Hotpoint's, such as the Middle East. As Professor Sky explained at the beginning of the course, \"after the course you should be able to hold a good dinner conversation about the state of the world\" (Paraphrased) ",

            "\u00a0If you'll consider majoring in Global affairs, I strongly recommend that you take this class to enable you gauge your level of sustained interest with regards to global issues. The class succeeds in exposing students to a wealth and variety of global affairs topics of particular interest. Your grade for the class( save for participation), will however, come down to 2 papers and 2 essays, with a less than opportune time frame. ",

I don't think this course offers any particular skill or insight helpful in applying for the major or for students seeking a foundational understanding of international relations. A good course, however, if you want to become a great conversationalist at cocktail parties or dinners. ",

            "\u00a0I am not a GLBL major and took this course as a 5th class and really enjoyed it. I am a political science major and I thought this course offered different perspectives about concepts I had learned in other classes. ",

            "\u00a0The course reviews from past semesters indicate that one's experience (and grade) varies by TA. While this may still be true, I heard that grading this semester was supposedly more normalized across sections. My TA seemed to be a fair grader. Original ideas and hard work could get you an A. It is a good idea to talk to your TA in office hours about your midterm and final essays. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Emma Sky is incredible (and cool) and all the lecturers give you a taste of their fields to introduce students to all that global affairs has to offer them. Everyone, including the teaching fellows, are inspiring and encouraging to the students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved the guest speakers and as a first-year, it was a great introduction to Yale. Professor Sky was very knowledgeable and gave entertaining lectures, especially when guests were brought in. I recommend this to anyone regardless of major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It's super interesting and a great intro to important current events, even if you don't plan on majoring in global affairs. ",
            "\u00a0You can really decide how much effort and time you want to put into this course, for example I barely read any of the papers and skimmed the book but I attended every single lecture and got high marks on the four papers. So if you want to read every paper you can, but attending the lectures is the most important part.\r\n\r\nThe prompts for the papers come out at least a month ahead of the due date, and so I would recommend choosing the prompt that seems the most interesting to you, and then making sure to attend the lectures that are relevant to that prompt.\r\n\r\nAs there is no final exam, it's not necessary to attend the other lectures, but this course is not about memorization or facts, it's about better understanding the world we live in, and the complicated international relations that rule our politics. So yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in learning more and broadening their horizons, especially non Global Affairs majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone interested in learning about global affairs. It really changed the manner in which I viewed and analysed international events. Professor Sky was brilliant. Learning about her work in Iraq was extremely interesting and her insights were invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0This class was interesting and a good introduction to global affairs, but because of the broad nature of GLBL 101  you may end up spending a lot of time studying topics that don't interest you. If you know you have specific interests, I think it would be better to take a more specific course. ",
            "\u00a0If unsure about what global affairs is ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who is interested in learning broadly about current affairs and listening to very good lecturers about these topics. ",
