            "\u00a0This course is a broad-brushstroke survey of the history of Arabic.  We learned both many facts about the Arabic language (from pre-Islamic Arabic to the modern dialect situation) and strategies for thinking about language development. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was overall fantastic.  There were a few weeks where the reading load was a bit too heavy.  Class discussions took for granted that everyone already had a good grasp of the readings, which meant that we could talk about more theoretical questions.  Homework was conducive to learning. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a great course if you have a good grasp of Arabic and a strong interest in philology and historical linguistics.  Otherwise, you will get lost very quickly.  For the first third or so of the course, having multiple Semitic languages would be helpful. "
