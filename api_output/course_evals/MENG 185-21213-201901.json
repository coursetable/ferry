            "\u00a0Gained an understanding of the design process, general machine shop experience and use of the CEID, basic CAD experience, knowledge about manufacturing, simple engineering models, basic statistics, and how to effectively work in a team. ",
            "\u00a0Exposure to a variety of engineering related topics, including business, physics, and the design process of a product. Also gained valuable skills (i.e. machining, solidworks, 3D printing). ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches very little and could be summarized in about a few lectures. However, it takes a full semester, becoming very tedious. You learn that teamwork doesn't necessarily help you, you learn decision making processes go beyond brain storming, you learn some engineering processes that are for the most part common sense, and you watch a CAD demonstration that helps no one due to its brevity and lack of planning. This course didn't help me grow as a person or as a student and it truly is a waste of time. Probably a weed out course despite being seemingly simple. Don't take this class. ",
            "\u00a0This taught me a lot about hands on design. There wasnt a ton of guidance from professor Booth so I learned to be more independent in making design dedications. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, we were able to learn the various phases of design implementation from concept generation until the final product. I was able to solidify my skills in physics, CAD, statistics and more. Here, we were able to apply this knowledge to the design process, making me understand how math, physics, and statistics truly do coincide with engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I got a good grasp of different engineering phases. It was also my first time in the machine shop. ",
            "\u00a0The most beneficial aspect of this course was opening our eyes to the different engineering resources available at Yale and teaching us how to access and utilize them. Beyond this, the course also introduced us to the engineering process, how to effectively work with a team, and how engineering works in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding the basics of Engineering ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to processes of design and foundation for further mechanical engineering courses ",
            "\u00a0I learned about basic engineering practices for design and manufacturing. "

        [
            "\u00a0I was lucky to be in a team in which the work was distributed pretty evenly amongst team members, but the grading system could be improved a little so that other members of a group do not have as large of an impact on one's own personal grade. An individual's success and general enjoyment of the course is very much dependent on their team. Also, having more time to learn SolidWorks and how to machine would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great at pushing you to learn new engineering skills, but that can make for a very time intensive process depending on how much you know before this class. It centers around a semester-long group based project, which is really exciting as ideas go from thought to paper and then to reality. It is a group project, though, so group dynamics and teamwork are a huge part of how enjoyable this course is. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course but a bit unorganized in terms of due dates for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The instruction for this course is incredibly vague. Booth clearly doesn't edit any of the slides or review lectures so everything appears very unprofessional, despite \"professional\" being the most used word by the professor. Much is asked of students, more so than should be expected, and very little is earned. The entire class feels like busy work, with the exciting payoff of completing an engineering project being minimal and boring. A strength of the class is that students all commiserate about how bad the class is in groupchats, providing bonding for undergraduate engineers. It could be improved by reevaluating the entire syllabus, providing activities for rotating groups to prevent stagnation, and providing more support for students in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course didnt have much guidance, but also I enjoyed the free reign over our projects. It was a ton of work outside of class, but the work wasnt necessarily hard, but took time. I enjoyed the actual manufacturing part of the class because everything else sort of felt like busywork. But I guess it was nice to see all the steps that actual engineers must complete for every design. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of fantastic parts to this course. The singular project over time gave us insight on how the design process is not a perfect science, allowing us to make changes over time as well as see every single stage through. The professor, TA, and ULA were a great support system during lab and office hours. The lectures were easy to follow and engaging, and the course material featured on exams was not an overwhelming amount. The overall organization of the course was weaker, however. There were many times where the instructions were not clear for assignments and times where deadlines were not well planned out. ",
            "\u00a0One major weakness of this class was the intellectual barrier between those that had some prior knowledge and those who did not. Being more inexperienced than some of my peers, sometimes I felt overlooked, be by my team or by the TA/ULAs. Because this was an introductory class, I wish that there was something in place to aid this divide. \r\n\r\nOne strength of this class is the hands-on nature of it. All the lectures related directly to our projects and I enjoyed seeing many concepts implemented. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths include teaching teamwork, displaying the available resources at Yale, allowing structured work time for an extended period of time during lab hours with TA's available to learn and ask questions from, and allowing students to work through the design process and learn the time management skills necessary to complete a project-based course. In my personal opinion, a major weakness was the lack of time in lecture to explain the weekly assignments, because often we would not know how to complete an assignment because we didn't have time to explain it, but it worked out in the end and I know the curriculum is pretty packed so it was also understandable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very poorly ran. The Professor and TAs were never on the same page with assignments and grading. There was too much busy work that took away from my interest in the course. This was supposed to be an introductory course but was not. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The entire course is based around a project and so it's very engaging, you get the experience of actually applying design principles in building things, being able to make a functional product by the end. It's also structured very well and divided well into different phases to guide your building process.\r\nWeaknesses: Heavily dependent on team members. I lucked out with a fantastic team to work with, but other people who took the class with me got teammates who didn't care about the class and so majorly suffered through. A lot of the theoretical content is niche and superficial ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is the amount of background knowledge that the students are expected to have, that does not coinside with the prereqs of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course information is designed to provide a solid general introduction to mechanical engineering. The groups should be allowed to be chosen by students after some level of interaction, or assigned intentionally by instructors. Perhaps students could submit a survey describing how they work, what they want out of the course, and previous engineering experience and groups could be assigned that way. This course was somewhat disorganized and it was often unclear exactly what was asked of students or what was unstated but still required. It would also be helpful if the course project was simpler than a CubeSat, since not all students have previous engineering experience. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I genuinely enjoyed many aspects of this course and it was really cool to have all of the assignments, research, and reports build toward something we successfully fabricated. The assignments were rather time consuming, but it was definitely a good break from other pset classes. Sadly, not many other introductory courses allow you to build things and to learn to machine and CAD. Having a quality team is essential though, otherwise it could be a long and frustrating semester. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend to any engineering major interested in learning about the design process from initial research to a final manufactured product. ",
            "\u00a0I would never recommend this course to other students, even those whom it is required for. Just skip it and keep taking engineering classes and you'll graduate with an ABET degree. The whole course felt like torture as every assignment is for the most part busy work. There is never anything exciting that happens the entire semester, the material is intuitive and unexciting, and the grading is strict.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for the first half of the semester all students do is fill out spreadsheets with painstaking detail to decide on how to build a glorified box. Then they write many pages saying how said box will be made. All of the stuff may actually happen in engineering but spending a semester on a stupid project isn't a way to express it that is constructive. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is questioning whether or not they would like to pursue mechanical engineering. I personally enjoyed this course, but it's not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a good introductory course to the engineering world. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course because it was incredibly exciting to learn about all the resources Yale engineering has to offer. Before the class, I was unaware most of the resources we used even existed and the course was a good introduction to them. I also enjoyed the material we learned and thought it was applicable to future courses and careers. ",
            "\u00a0No. Compared to what Ive heard about this course in the past, it is much more difficult and disorganized. There was too much busy work and the Professor and TAs did not provide helpful feedback, were unresponsive, and were overall disorganized in running this course. I was very excited to take this course but ended up being disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good opportunity to build a project (ours was a CubeSat) and get experience with machining, assembling a product, and working with a team. The actual theoretical content of the course is not very deep and is only going to serve as a foundation for higher level MechE courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I loved the hands on approach and the project based learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class has the potential to be a helpful introduction to mechanical engineering. As of right now, it is disorganized and relies very heavily on previous engineering knowledge. Students with a previous background in engineering have a clear advantage in the class. Often it wasn't clear exactly what the instructors wanted. I would not recommend this class to another student who did not have a background in engineering. I would tell a student to take at least one other introductory mechanical engineering course before taking this course, and I would tell them to take this course only if they had to. "
