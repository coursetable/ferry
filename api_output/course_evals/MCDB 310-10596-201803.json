            "\u00a0I learned how to synthesize the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, and biochemistry to achieve a deeply detailed understanding of the human body and the function of its several amazing physiological systems. While the class was rooted in physiological cause and effect (if \"x\" changes, what happens to \"y\" system), this class exposes you to anatomy, electrochemistry, and techniques in biomedical engineering/physiology. This class makes you think outside the box all the time, pushing the upper limits of your knowledge and your ability to comprehend complex information. ",

Really built on a strong physical foundation but focused primarily on function (no memorizing anatomy). This class taught me to be a quick but inquisitive thinker. I developed an understanding of every system in the body on its own, but there were common themes that made it feel like I was really studying the human body instead of its isolated components. This class really excites me about medicine. Throughout the semester I felt like the emphasis was really on learning the fundamental concepts, not memorizing small facts (although the amount of information can be overwhelming). I actually felt like I wasnt just memorizingI was really gaining an intuitive sense of how the human body works. ",

This class also taught me how to understand the different systems and how their structure leads to function, instead of simply memorizing facts and the names of the different components. Instead, I learned about how each component works and complements each other to form a complete human. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are amazing!!! The professors are all very engaged and sometimes we did not get through all the slides because they were excited to speak in more detail about specific parts.  And not getting through the slides was fine because you can just read about it in the book.  I loved the fast pace of the class and the huge volume of material that we had to learn.  It challenged me in the best ways!  The weekly quizzes helped me to focus on what was more important and the learning objectives helped me to zero in on what to focus more deeply in for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the information is incredibly interesting. Guest lecturers Dr. Aronson (kidneys) and Dr. Holt (endocrine system) were both fantastic. They both had really clear cut lectures. I feel like I learned a lot of information from the class as a whole, as well. The professors do really listen to student feedback. Everyone felt like the first exam was too long, so they shortened the second one. I also really liked having learning objectives because it outlined the lecture and helped me organize the material when studying for exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like there needed to be an anatomy component to this course. It was almost completely glazed over in every system. I also felt like the lectures got over complicated, and I think that is partially due to our incredibly over-complicated textbook. The textbook is honestly terrible. It's so over-detailed and even the instructors make fun of that. I think the book really needs to be changed. Furthermore, Dr. Boulpaep's lectures were the worst of the semester by far. He had too many slides with too much complicated information on them and it was presented terribly. I don't know a single person who actually liked those lectures. In general, I found the teaching to be rather average with the exceptions of Dr. Aronson and Dr. Holt. I felt like concepts weren't always explained clearly and sometimes felt like the professors themselves weren't quite sure what they were teaching. I will say that, for a class that is rated so highly on CourseTable, I was a little bit disappointed. I don't know if it's because the head instructor changed from one person to two people or if it's something else, but I just thought the organization could be better, the level of teaching could be better, and the book absolutely could be better. I also wish we could've taken our midterms home with us to review. It was also really random to have the nervous system lecture right in the middle of the cardiovascular system lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredibly time consuming. It's great because you learn a lot of necessary information, but sometimes the level of detail expected was too high. The course instructors should be aware that many students are taking a heavy course load that also demands their time. Additionally, the assigned textbook was TERRIBLE. It had way to much experimental and historical information. No one cares about how this person won the Nobel Prize for this one discovery. My TA recommended a different text which saved me. I have no idea why they use the Boron and Boulpaep. It was also super annoying that the course provided no answer keys for the practice materials. How is it supposed to be helpful if you can't check your work. Ditto with not letting us keep our midterms. I understand not wanting to have floating copies around, but then provide something with answers that can be used to for practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = weekly quizzes provide structured time for students to review weekly coursework. Without them I definitely wouldn't have stayed on top of my work. Additionally, having guest lecturers from the medical school made the class really interesting and reminded us about the importance of what we were learning. Professor Saltzman and Campbell are also great lecturers.\r\nWeaknesses= some minor concepts were still asked on tests, although the course has definitely worked to improve this issue. Additionally, some lecturers felt really rushed and slides at the end, which contained important information, were not taught fully ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well taught, but it was a ton of information, and I think that we might have benefitted from touching on fewer topics so that we could go a little more slowly through some of the more complex topics. Though the quizzes were \"annoying\" to have over the weekend, it was really useful to review the previous week. The TAs were excellent, and the professors were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0a lot of material gets covered really quickly, so you learn a lot. The weekly quizzes help you make sure you're keeping up, but the class could benefit from covering maybe one less system or being split into two semesters to slow the pace a bit. ",
            "\u00a0This class has so many strengths. The teaching structure is absolutely fantastic. You have experts in a range of disciplines coming in to teach an undergraduate course, something that doesn't happen all to often at Yale. From Professor Saltzman (various topics) to Professor Campbell (cardiovascular and nervous systems), Professor Boulpaep (vascular), Professor Aronson (nephrology), and Professor Holt (endocrinology), you are learning from some of the very best in their fields. You know how you always hear about classes like this when you apply to yale where you learn from \"world-class faculty?\" Well sure enough this may be one of the few that actually lives up to that billing. The teaching fellows were also incredible and are absolutely instrumental to one's success in this course. They are all well-trained, understanding of students' needs, and extend their time to help with some very difficult material. I never thought I would actually take a science course at Yale where I could say that about the teaching fellows but this was a truly exceptional group and I am so grateful to all of them. ",
            "\u00a0Better lecture slides would be more helpful for studying ",
            "\u00a0We were absolutely swamped with information in lecture. Not only were we responsible for understanding and memorizing the overall function of certain systems, we also needed to know very specific details and facts about systems as well. It was impossible to memorize all the material in lecture. The textbook is terrible (one of the professors that teaches the course wrote part of it, which is why its still the textbook despite being 3000 pages long and useless), but the lecture slides are usually coherent and comprehensive. The material is truly fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is the weekly quizzes. Although they take a while, it makes sure people keep up with the material which is absolutely necessary in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Because the class had five professors it was sometimes hard for me to get used to a teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs, teaching staff, content. The teaching staff and TAs for this course were very good. I think that having a few actual physicians come into the course and teach about their respective fields was great, and I found the TAs to be very insightful and gave good sections/review sessions. The content is also great; every major system is covered in great detail (including everything on the MCAT) so I think for anyone interested in the body you will find the content engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exam style, grading. It's hard to do well in the course. The midterm style is mostly multiple choice and T/F. Except there are like a-h+ options for each multiple choice and they're designed to nit-pick every single small detail from the slides, and the T/F are meant to trick you also. For a course about systems, the majority of the points come from not understanding the system and just memorizing random words from the slides. The course goes fast, and a lot is covered in each 50 minute lecture. For reference, I took MB&B300 at the same time and felt that 2 of these 50 minute lectures covered more content than both of the 75 minute biochem lectures (and you have 3 of these 50 minute lectures every week...). The final was the same way. The curve is pretty harsh as the course is filled with grad students and aggressive pre-meds as you might expect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Weekly quizzes really kept me on top of the material and they were not a source of stress because if you attended section you could earn back full points. The questions they asked were focused on the learning objectives and for the most part fair. Superb, world-class professors and delightful TFs. I found that Saltzman and Campbell had very similar, engaging lecturing styles. Section was super helpful in that it presented the material in a new context and gave a space to ask questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course focused very much on the details of each system, which was great, but I wish I had more practice applying the material to case-studies because the final was almost entirely case studies. Be warned: the multiple choice on the tests is like sudden death round (heavily weighted), and the grading was not entirely transparent on the short answer questions (looked for very specific things in the short answer questions, like key words). You dont get the exams handed back either so I found it difficult to learn from my mistakes. I found it difficult to adapt to Aronson and Holts lecture styles, although I appreciated learning about the renal and endocrine systems from experts in their fields. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong because it is super detailed and comprehensive and all the lectures build on each other so by the end of the semester you feel like you seriously understand many aspects of human physiology and how different systems relate to each other. The big lecture style is not always the best learning method, as sometimes it is hard to ask questions or answer them during lecture, but the way that the professors are quite available for help alleviates this a bit. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the wonderful TAs, who are willing to meet and help students. I know that this is their job, but not all graduate students are so willing sometimes. I really enjoyed the way the class was thought. Sometimes it was too fast-paced and that was a little anxiety-inducing, but at least all the material that was in the exams was covered in class. The first midterm was incredibly long for the time given. second midterm was better. But, the final was just so many open-ended answers , and it took all 3 hours even though by Yale law we should have had extra time to check and review answers. This was not the case. I think the professors were overly ambitious. I still loved the course, but not gonna li ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes I've ever taken in my time at Yale!! It revamped my interest in medicine. Also super good to take in conjunction with biochem, since they both cover a lot of the same concepts, only in microscopic vs macroscopic detail. Be warned though, the amount of material you will learn in a semesters time is absolutely insane. Take other gut classes if you choose to take physio. The class uses Boron and Boulpaep textbook, which is what most med schools use. Even then, med students don't read it bc it's so unnecessarily detailed. Get Costanzo's textbook instead. It's way shorter, straight to the point, and does a good job of covering what is learned in the class plus clinical cases ",
            "\u00a0too much material, we dont always get through everything in class ",
            "\u00a0It was a very interesting course and it was very well taught. The heart guest-lecturer could improve, as those lectures were confusing. Additionally, one hard part of the course is the quantity of information that must be learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very strong guest lectures by Aronson and Holt, going to section to boost the quiz score was a nice system, the second midterm was the most fair (time/content wise), main objectives at the end of the lecture really helped focus learning \r\nWeaknesses: Often lectures would run over and students would be expected to learn the last slides on their own/even take quizzes on them, quizzes didn't really help with learning because they asked very dense questions that required looking up of information (quizzes were more time-consuming than helpful), unnecessary live (in class) drawing of diagrams that took up precious class time, an unnecessarily bulky final examasked too many detail-oriented questions while only supposedly being worth '1/3' of the exam, short answer section was very long ",
            "\u00a0It is incredibly interesting subject matter and is taught very well. It obviously moves very quickly, but Im not sure if there is any way around that. Tests occasionally were difficult to finish in the allotted time period. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the course was the learning objectives and the weekly quizzes that forced me to keep up with the material, since there is a lot of material we went through each week. A weakness would be the lecturers themselves. Most were great, but I could barely follow along Professor Boupaep's lectures and I love Professor Campbell's touch screen hand-drawn annotations but it was a bit frustrating when he'd run out of time and breeze through the last 6 slides so that we had to learn it ourselves. I also loved Professor Aronson, he taught kidney physiology so well! ",
            "\u00a0I would appreciate if sections were more structured and more practice questions were given before exams, but overall the instructors worked really hard to provide learning objectives and the main concepts of different units. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quizzes, TA's, and learning goals at the end of each lecture were very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly I kind of wish the multiple choice and true/false questions were less nit-picky. They were incredibly tricky. I feel like they could have been made a bit easier and they still would have served as good tests of our knowledge of the material. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this class is that the material is interesting to learn. Studying always felt like something I was doing for my own advancement less so than preparing for a test. Section was also very good and served as excellent reviews of the material. A weakness was the exam structure. I think this class could be benefited from another midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Very organized and well taught. TAs were on top of their sessions. Lesson objectives were clear. The midterms are difficult. ",
            "\u00a0A lot to memorize but very organized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- super interesting, applicable information \r\nWeaknesses- extreme workload\r\n\r\nThis course would have been really great as a 2 semester course. I found it super hard to fully understand the material in the time provided. ",
            "\u00a0The HUGE strength of this course is in its breadth and depth. This course once again covers every major tissue in the body in great detail, and has numerous guest lecturers come in to present about certain topics such as the kidneys and endocrine system. Because of this depth, I genuinely feel like I understand how my body functions and better understand why certain illnesses occur.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of how much is covered, this course moves incredibly fast. Often, TOO fast. Although the lecture PDFs are helpful, the diagrams usually lack context and therefore, it's hard to understand what's going on in them when reviewing for the exams. Additionally, when preparing for exams, although practice tests are available, the solutions for these practice tests are not. Therefore, I don't know if I am misunderstanding something. Additionally, the course could also benefit from something like a weekly review session (not just before the exam.) Within the 3 lectures each week, SO much is covered. Because of this, there are certain things that are rushed over/briefly mentioned that need more explanation from a TF. ",
            "\u00a0The 9:25 am nature of this class meant that I went a lot less frequently than would have been good for my grade. \r\nAlso, this time teaching the class they made a big push to have learning objectives to have key takeaways from each lecture, and that was extremely helpful in studying. However, as part of the same push, they had more short answer questions, and to me that was a mistake; because they seemed to be looking for very specific key words, I could know the whole process and only get half credit on a question because I didn't go into enough detail. However, the questions were broad enough (\"describe the entire process of light signaling\") that it's unclear how much detail is required, and because the tests are fairly time pressured it doesn't make sense to sit there and write out every single detail. \r\nHowever, overall the class teaches truly amazing material in a way that focuses on systems and highlights similarities; one of the better biology courses I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are generally in the content being taught and the structure of the lectures and the discussion sections. Discussion sections were especially helpful in learning.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are hard to change, as they may simply be a characteristic of this type of biology-based course, but the course was made difficult by the sheer amount of brute memorization (often illogical) that was required. In addition, because the lectures were often taught by different professors (with the goal of being taught by professors with the most expertise in each subtopic) the course felt a little disjointed. More importantly, however, each professor made lecture slides that were very different from those of the others, varying wildly in quality, depth, length, clarity, and even formatting. It was somewhat difficult to study from these slides when they were so different. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wonderful amount of detail;\r\nWeekly quizzes did a great job of reinforcing material;\r\nTF's were marvelous and very well-informed;\r\nI didn't personally use the learning objectives, but they're a great idea for making sure that students get the right takeaways from lectures;\r\nCourse is very well-organized and the instructors are very open to feedback;\r\nPoll questions were fun and good ways to review information;\r\nGuest lecturers, for the most part, were interesting and very well-done. The kidney lectures in particular were FANTASTICLY taught and provided me with a load of information in a way that never felt overwhelming. Professor Aronson's lectures were extremely well-organized and made in a way that greatly facilitated my learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Anatomy is not covered, though there's really no time for this, and it's not super necessary;\r\nPathophysiology was rarely mentioned, which makes sense given the many other things that must be taught, though I must say that pathophysiology provides a great way to better understand normal physiology;\r\nCardiology lectures were not enjoyable, and I say this as a student who came into this class wanting to be a cardiologist. Professor Boulpaep is a fantastic lecturer, but he moved far too quickly for me to absorb anything he said. Even when professor Campbell covered the rest of cardiology, things were still imperfect because, although his slower pace helped me understand what he was teaching, he often moved too slowly to cover the last few slides of lectures, and these slides often contained the most difficult material. Professors: Please consider finding a balance between these two, so that cardiology can be more fun and less frustrating to understand. ",
            "\u00a0My one complaint: Confusing multiple choice question of the exams that had options like \"two of a, b, and c\" or \"three of a, b, and c\" ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the lectures were excellent in breaking down complex systems into parts we could understand, though it varied significantly by instructor and topic.  Weekly quizzes were helpful in reinforcing the material, and organization of sections was good.  Learning objectives were also very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses:  I appreciate the reasoning for having experts in their fields come explain certain portions of the class.  However, I think it interrupted the flow of the class and would have preferred if one instructor taught all of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, excellent instructors and TFs, I liked that we had guest lecturers, a lot of available resources\r\nImprovements: more office hour times in the afternoon or at night rather than in morning ",
            "\u00a0This course moves very quickly and efficiently through the material.  This leads to a bit of stress before the exams, but it's manageable. The sections were always disorganized and not enough to cover or even comprehensively review the material from lecture. The exam questions were often identical to the sample questions, which while convenient for review, made studying the actual material secondary to memorizing the sample questions.  This would be improved by writing more questions or by focusing more on the long response questions.  The long response questions were often clever and well-written. I felt that in answering these exam questions I improved my understanding of the material.  It made me realize the depth to which I understood the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Instructors were painfully worried about giving students too many practice questions for tests - they prioritized curving the class and keeping the average low over having students learn the material through practice questions. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very organized and engaging, and I have always found that both the course coordinators and the guest lecturers are ready to answer any questions.\r\nSometimes the lectures can be very dense and hard to follow, such as the the cardiovascular system lectures with many slides. I also found that the supplemental lecture notes given for the renal lectures were incredibly helpful and would be great for other parts of the course as well. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the weekly quizzes that help students keep on track with their understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nThe assigned textbook was extremely dense, and unhelpful. Most of the times, the explanations went beyond the scope of the course, and therefore was not useful in helping our understanding of the coursework. \r\n\r\nI did not like how the class rotated through so many professors. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of this course is fine.  Each lecture is dedicated to a topic, and some topics take up several lectures.  Some of the topics that the professors think are important take up a lot of class time and other topics are left by the wayside when we feel like they could have used a better explanation.  Having so many different professors teaching the different topics could be a benefit and disadvantage; they obviously each knew their own field very well, but they each taught very differently, so you would hardly get the chance to get used to the teaching style of one teacher before moving on to the next.  In addition, some of the guest lecturers were not easy to understand in their explanations.  The weekly quizzes are kind of annoying in that they are only available over the weekend so we are forced to work on them Friday through Sunday; I would often leave them till Sunday night, which is not the best situation.  It would be nice to have a few more days to work on them so that we could start on the questions that we had already learned the material for.  They were a good way to have a check on our understanding to see what aspects of the material we understood and what we did not.  Section was also a huge help every week, to both go over the quizzes and to test our understanding of the material while trying to figure through some clinical cases. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the layout of the course, but I felt like a few lectures could have been better organized. The lectures on the senses felt rushed and the lecture on the CNS could have been better placed amongst the other lectures. However, the course did a great job with teaching small details in a way that made sense as a whole, rather than forcing students to memorize these details. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of material covered is borderline insane. It was difficult to know what to focus on, which made it hard to study for exams. The textbook is so dense and covers far more than what you are expected to learn, which makes it a less-valuable study tool. That being said, it is incredible how much you learn by the end. "

You really do learn so much about things that are occurring everyday inside your body, and that's pretty amazing. Also for pre-med students, this is a great class to take to learn about anatomy and physiology, one of the only ones offered for Yale undergrads. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome. The content is incredibly cool and it is very well taught. The core 2 professors are great and then they bring in experts to teach certain things. If you like learning about the human body this is the class for you. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It is by far and away the best course I have taken at Yale, from instructor engagement to relevance of material and student support. It takes everything you learned in your less interesting science courses at Yale and makes them interesting by applying them to human life/medicine. If you ever want to take the MCAT, this class should be hands-down a requirement. I loved this class so much I wish there was a physiology major at Yale. Since it is quite difficult and grading tends to be harsh, I suggest limiting the difficulty of your other courses or taking this course credit/D, although I believe you will be much more motivated and learn much more if you don't take it Credit/D. Once you look past the difficulty of course and get into the nitty gritty details of human physiology, you are exposed to an amazingly complex and intriguing field of knowledge. ",

However, be advised if you're looking to get an A you will have to fight very hard against the sea of senior premeds in the course. The grade is on a curve and people do very well. The course goes fast and the midterms only nit-pick details. Despite the fact that the course is about systems, you will have to spend countless hours developing a photo-memory of the slides if you want to do well on the exams. If I were taking the course credit/D I would have probably given it a 10/10 so if you're looking to that then I would highly recommend it (although note you're still going to have to work for that credit...).

Its one of the best-taught STEM classes at Yale and you do not want to miss out on this extraordinary educational opportunity. This class is the closest thing youll get to what med school is like, so if youre at all interested in medicine or just the human body in general, I would highly recommend it. I felt like all the concepts we learned in class were interesting and relevant. I took it as an elective (I decided not to credit/D halfway through). It can be a lot on your plate if youre taking two other rigorous STEM courses, but I have no regrets. Take it!!!!!!!! ",

As a pre-med, I was already very passionate about the material and it was nice to take a class that was more directly applicable to medicine than biochemistry/physics/etc. Taking physio was such a rewarding experience. There is a large amount of material and the class mirrors an intro physio class in med school, so I definitely spent most of my time on this one class. I would definitely recommend that you take it, but if you can't afford to focus entirely on this class, consider taking it credit d or maybe taking easier classes to make time for this. Don't take it with four other classes. ",

Guest lectures done by Aronson for the kidneys and Holt for the endocrine system are very well put together. As a biology student, I found some of the calculation/equation parts of the class to be difficult and not particularly well taught, but perhaps if you're an engineering student, this won't be a problem. You will end up breezing over some systems (liver, reproduction, etc.) and really diving into others (kidneys, heart), but overall, you will get a good sense of how your body is functioning. A good survey class with tricky exams. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is graded relatively harshly, there is no curve. This is expected of high level classes. If you put the time in and perform well, you will feel very rewarded. If you put the time in and perform average or below average, you will feel like the class is wasting your time. Time needs to be put in. It meets early, and the textbook is way too complicated and goes into too much detail compared to what you are expected to know. The learning objectives are nice and are provided at the end of every lecture. Learning objectives are highlighted in lecture, but the slides are mostly pictures and you will miss a lot of information/nuance if you do not attend. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to do the work, definitely go for it. This course will provide you with so much insight on the human body and will really let you know if you are interested in being a doctor or not. It will be tough and a lot of work, but worth it. ",

Each system is so interesting to learn about and you really do learn a lot. It is a really fast class though, and you go through a ton of material. But in the end I'm really happy that I took this class and I would take it again if I could! ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to a friend. It was mostly BME majors, but as a MCDB major, I found it to be a wonderful elective. A note of warning, though. If you are also planning on taking physics 180, be weary of the fact that both classes always give their midterms and exams a day apart. Great material to be learned too. ",

I didn't fall in love with physio after taking the course, but I think that is mostly because I was so stressed about learning all the material. If there was more time (or less content), I think I would have enjoyed it a great deal more. \r\n\r\nThe quality of this class really depends on who is teaching. Campbell was by far the most clear lecturer. On the other hand, the cardiovascular lectures were terrible and I basically taught myself the entire unit by reading the textbook. \r\n\r\nIf you're taking this at the same time as physics180...beware, you are in for a tough semester! If at all possible, do not take physio and physics at the same time (although this is unavoidable for most BME majors). ",

If one is taking this course for fun, I recommend taking it credit C/fail is possible. Once again, this course is incredibly interesting... it just requires more time to be put into it than students with busy stem schedules have available. ",

It is not enjoyable unless you like the subject and know that knowing the content is simply a requirement in order to progress into more directly interesting or niche topics in biology or biomedical engineering.

I've never had the privilege of learning about the body in such an in-depth way, and I'm now really excited to go to medical school and keep learning these things. I'm also taking the MCAT soon, and this class was GREAT for reviewing the biology portions of the exam. The professors and TFs are kind and serious about your learning.

I had a really hard time with the exams, even though I put in a ton of work learning the material and the concepts because I did not spend enough time on memorization and it really came back to bite me.  Unfortunately, the professors seem to emphasize learning the concepts, but then test on small details that you need to have had memorized, so I am not sure what they expect.  I spent many hours on this class just in an effort to pass which is such a shame because I honestly really enjoy learning the material and find it so interesting, especially when we talk about the systems in a clinical sense and what happens when things go wrong. ",

I would recommend this to anyone interested in going on to study medicine or interested in pursuing a PhD in a related area. Pre-health students may not choose to take this course as they believe it will be covered in professional school; however, I thought it was a great way to get a strong foundation in physiology, and I feel very prepared to enter physiology courses in veterinary school.
