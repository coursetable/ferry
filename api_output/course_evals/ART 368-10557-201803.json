            "\u00a0This course made me aware of basic graphic design elements and principles, particularly in typography. The various assignments, readings, and ways the course was carried out allowed me to be an acute observer within my own work and that of others. Although I previously knew how to use InDesign, this class made me even better at the software. In addition, I have learned how to use other tools such as the Risograph. I have been exposed to the work of many other people I was previously unaware of, whether famous or up-and-coming designers. This class also helped students develop their skills in constructively critiquing each other's work. ",
            "\u00a0Everything relating to design. This course is a comprehensive deep-dive into everything in the realm of graphic design. We started with some simple (but rigorous) typography assignments and then moved into concepts of branding, identity, progression, development, and narrative. Certainly a lot of work but Pamela is an amazing teacher and person -- well worth the effort. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course provided different ways of learning about various subjects, from text-based deliverables to image-based products. Pamela's use of readings, assignments, lectures, and in-class activities established a well-rounded curriculum. Moreover, this variety led to a dynamic, fun way of learning. "

            "\u00a0I would undoubtedly recommend this course to others, regardless of major or background. The small size of the class allowed us to become close, which, in some ways, helped us provide better, more knowledgeable critiques of each other's work. It was my favorite class this past semester, and it makes me sad that it must come to an end. Despite being four hours long on a Friday, the class always seemed to happen to quickly. The various activities we did, the productive discussions we had, and the lectures we received (from Pamela and guests) provided different angles of learning about graphic design methodologies. Each assignment was rewarding and applicable in countless ways. By participating in the Odds & Ends Book Fair, I felt as though the class was greater than a typical classroom learning environment; we were able to be part of the school and the design world at large. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Pamela is INCREDIBLE. Expect lots of feedback on your work, and lots of opportunity to contact her (and the TA) outside of class. The class is a lot of assignments, but they're fun and vary in their focus enough to stay engaging - it doesn't feel as if you're doing the same work week-to-week. On top of this, Pamela brings in great guests nearly every class who add a lot to the curriculum. The near 4 hour class never felt long. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Pamela is an incredibly knowledgeable and caring professor. "
