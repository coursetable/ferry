What you learn in this course will apply well beyond the limits of the classroom and truly give you a new perspective. ",

The course is centered around 6 different theoretical lenses and I appreciated that much of the semester was spent learning how to use them simultaneously. Professor Lyall's historical and chronological approach to international relations allowed us to learn that much of what we consider to be modern aspects of the world have really existed for thousands and thousands of years. We only got to World War II and the Cold War by spring break and the modern half of the course was just as complex and nuanced as the first.

The lectures are engaging and on extremely interesting topics and section with my TA complemented the lectures perfectly. Every aspect of the course is paced perfectly and organized in a logical manner. Though the readings can be bit heavy at the beginning of the course, but the content learned through them is extremely valuable and they are amazing resources when completing the assignments. There are no weaknesses to this course as long as you keep up on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were really professor Lyall. He was an incredible lecturer and pulled us all into a lecture despite the fact that it was a relatively large lecture and classroom. He was clearly so passionate about what we were learning and also about us as students and our understanding. We had a lecture about 2/3 through the semester where we had a class-wide debate about whether or not US actions in Iraq could be considered a war crime. He was always very careful to make sure that he was presenting the information as objectively as possible, never revealing his preferences for certain explanations than others. ",

That said, I didn't really gain any practical knowledge from the course, but that's also because you're not supposed to be because it's ~theoretical~. The readings were engaging but nothing that was a pain to get through (my TA split up the readings in session so I never had to do all of them-- if I had, it would've been a pain). ",
            "\u00a0I believe there's way too much assigned for this class. Sometimes up to 150 pages a week of academic reading is very tough especially when you have a full schedule. ",

However, a strength is that the lecturer, Jason Lyall, is absolutely amazing and makes the lectures incredibly interesting on a daily basis. ",

Also while the theories of realism, liberalism, and constructivism are heavily covered, the other lenses are introduced and quickly forgotten about. ",

It was easy to feel overwhelmed with the readings, while they were all very interesting. I also found that some of the discussions were rather limited; while the course claimed to consider the socially-constructed theories, there was very little application of these lenses, likely due to the lack of time to cover them.

An amazing course!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes section wasn't well structured and I wish it was rooted in discussing the readings more which would have been helpful for the final, too  many readings for sure ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are pretty good, although would benefit from student engagement. Readings are difficult but rewarding, and well chosen to illustrate the differences of opinion that constitute international relations. Weaknesses: I think using the lenses (realism, rationalism, constructivism, etc.) is a great way to introduce students to the debates in IR, but both lecture and section tended to oversimplify things just so every subject would fit neatly into the different IR lenses. Almost nothing we learned could fit neatly into five discrete boxes of thought, but that was how they were portrayed. I think the course could have included a little more on genocide and migration, but that's just me. Finally, my TA was stunningly unhelpful. He didn't facilitate a very engaging section, and his feedback on my papers was like he hadn't even read them. ",

Another thing was that we spent a lot of time doing theoretical International Relations in the beginning only to learn at the end that none of it was applicable in modern day? ",

The course has way too many readings and the lectures, sections, and course examinations/essays are very disjointed from each other. Expectations also need to be more clear, including essay rubric and, expectations. ",

            "\u00a0Although you cover a lot of material throughout the semester, I felt that it was only a superficial understanding because each lecture was about a different topic. I did like the organization of the lectures, first, it started with the different theoretical lenses that you will use throughout the semester and then began to examine historical examples with an application of the lenses.

He (as well as really great TFs) made the course so enjoyable and I learned more than in any other class I've taken.

You don't really have to show up to class bc the prof posts the slides and also the prof speaks so fast and goes through the slides so quickly that even if you're in class you're gonna tell yourself you're gonna look at the slides after class (even tho you prob won't). Literally all of the first semester is super dry boring history so if you think you can get through all of that and the midterm to get to the actually interesting stuff like terrorism and threats to hegemony (is hegemony even real??) and climate change then feel free.

Readings are extremely numerous and you honestly need to do all of them to stay up to date for sections and to understand what's happening.  Expect to spend many hours every week just trying to understand the readings and theories, especially the first half of the semester.  The sections ran vary autonomously to the lecture, and oftentimes I felt like the section was not even following the ideas from lecture.  The expectations are also high, but that could just be my TF who was very unclear with expectations, grading, etc. The final exam was absolutely beyond excessive, in the sense that you had to prepare for triple the number of essays actually to be written (outline 12 essays to write about 3) and then you essentially just recite your outlines and hope you incorporate enough readings, insights, etc.  The class caused way more stress than necessary, was not well organized, and not worth my time nor yours.
