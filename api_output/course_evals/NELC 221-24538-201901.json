            "\u00a0Well, since Christina is leaving I guess you won't be able to take this course. But if she somehow comes back and teaches it again, I'd highly recommend it. Not a very difficult course, Christina's nice as well as German, you might get to go on a field trip, and you learn a lot about the literature and culture of Egypt. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of ancient history, or anyone interested in ancient literature. There is a lot of reading in this course, so these interests, while not required, are recommended. Even if you have no previous knowledge of ancient Egyptian history, it is covered enough in class that it is not necessary and should not hold anyone back from the course. "
