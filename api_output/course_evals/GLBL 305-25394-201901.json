            "\u00a0Business models, understanding social enterprises ",
            "\u00a0Learned about microcredit, business models, emerging markets, strategies/philosophies for development. everything was fascinating and super applicable! also learned how to read and write case studies! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a practical deep-dive into the complicated world of social enterprise; we looked at different frameworks to approach the difficult problems in this sector and different organizations that inserted themselves into this messy environment. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved taking Social Enterprise in Developing Economies this semester. I gained substantial knowledge about how social enterprises function, they major challenges facing social enterprises today, and also learned about a plethora of different public/ private enterprises is various regions around the world. \r\n\r\nPlanning logistics for our summer trip, and preparing to leave for 9-10 weeks, has been a core aspect of this course, too. I feel prepared for my team's summer experience, and I look forward to it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about the world of social enterprises, and made some improvements on my presentation skills. I believe there is a reasonable amount of preparation for the summer work, and I feel confident going into a still somewhat unfamiliar internship. Some of the professional skills brought up in class seem universally applicable. All in all, however, this course was not particularly information dense or rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0An ability to analyze different business models, engage with theories of change, and taget different levels of the supply chain. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an overview understanding of some of the challenges facing social enterprises operating in the developing world and creative strategies they've developed to overcome them. We also received extensive preparation for our summer experiences, which I anticipate will be an integral part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the burgeoning field of social enterprise and impact investing. ",
            "\u00a0The function of social enterprises, the business structure and competing interests, how to read and analyze a case study. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Social Enterprise industry, the fundamental controversies surrounding it, and how business models are developed and tweaked over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about social enterprise in developing economies, and how businesses set and work towards their goals "

        [
            "\u00a0I think that the talking in the beginning can be cut short which can be addressed through perhaps a set time for office hours? Or students just knowing when he is available. ",
            "\u00a0i would say that this course was designed well. however, I didn't like the group presentations we did at the end (they got boring after a while and were repetitive). i think that having group assignments at the beginning of the semester would be good so that we practice working with our groups. my group spent time together outside of class (we got lunch a few times) but maybe making that mandatory would be good. ",
            "\u00a0The small-class feel allowed the seminar to thrive with Q+A time and to really zone in and focus on the confusing parts of social enterprises. Moreover, the team breakdowns at the beginning of the semester and team assignments later on in the semester were good decisions; this made it conducive for teammates to know each other better and how they work. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps incorporating team work in another way during the spring semester may improve the course. There was a large emphasis on team work in the last few weeks of the semester, but our assignments did not directly related to the team-based work we are preparing to do this summer. Aligning the spring team assignments to preparation for our summer trips would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Apparently this course used to be taught twice a week, and I think maybe that would have worked better than the 2hr once-a-week seminar. We read theory and cases for each class, however it was often cumbersome to discuss everything at once. We definitely touched on a lot of the fascinating basic concepts of social enterprise, however it was difficult to really dig into these given the time crunch. ",
            "\u00a0This course has so many applications to the real world - the summer component is amazing, and the exposure to guest speakers who work at the same companies you've been reading about is super cool. Learning how to apply for fellowships and work in a team setting are invaluable skills as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fascinating dive into an interesting subject that can't be explored in other classes at Yale. A major strength of the course is the summer component, which allows students to not only secure a great summer opportunity early in the semester but also complements the course well by giving students experience working at an SME in the developing world. The first half of the course was structured well, as we looked at a different case study each week and discussed it in depth in class, but I felt as if the class discussions were somewhat unstructured, and I was not sure what specific takeaways we were supposed to draw from each class. However, I enjoyed our discussions a lot and found them helpful in processing the information. I felt that my level of engagement with the course decreased in the second half of the semester when we were no longer discussing specific cases as a group, but moved to presentations. I felt that the presentations were often repetitive and did not add new analysis to the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Summer component. Support given to ensuring we would have funding and resources and funding.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Did not really follow syllabus so little transparency around grades. New assignments not on syllabus introduced. ",
            "\u00a0I think meeting twice a week again could help us focus both on the case studies and theoretical aspects--we often focused on the case studies and less on the foundational concepts. Also, making some questions about the theoretical papers in the homework could be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the summer opportunity and small-class environment, which made the class a very collaborative one. The weaknesses are the poor organization and misuse of class time, as well as a feeling that I was not learning much at all in the second half of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes -- if you are interested in business take it because of the summer opportunity and the business knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0yes! if you can get in, AFST 305 is a must. i was feeling super disappointed by my yale education (think: lots of huge lectures) and felt as if the promises yale makes you when you commit here were falsehoods until I took this class. Bo's class is fascinating, engaging, fun, and challenging. the weekly case study write-ups and background readings were a lot at times, but frontloaded and didn't interfere with midterms or finals. if you are at all interested in development, social enterprise, NGOs, impact investing  this class is a must. Also, Bo is amazing; super helpful and takes the time to get to know everyone in the course and is definitely the type to help you with job stuff. He is an enthusiastic teacher and even got someone from the CTL to help consult him on how to make the course better. I have yet to see such dedication to teaching at yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is one of the most practical courses out there, and the year-long commitment might seem a lot, but there's a natural progression that requires the full year, and I think that I would get a lot of out of it at the end of the year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Bo is a wonderful instructor, and you will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! I loved this course, and am excited for the second semester as well. It's such a cool collection of projects that no matter which one you end one it'll be a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you're at all interested in studying development issues and/or private sector solutions to social problems. The course feels extremely grounded in the current landscape of SMEs and you will leave with an understanding of a fascinating and somewhat controversial industry. I am very much looking forward to my fieldwork this summer. I don't know of any other course at Yale that provides you with an 8-10 week summer experience in a fascinating field and rich cultural context. ",
            "\u00a0If they're interested in the summer opportunity and are willing to go through a relatively tedious class to get it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn a lot about the real world applications of economics and the course opened my eyes to a career field I did not know much about, but now want to work in. ",
            "\u00a0I would only if the student is interested in the summer component. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in economies in Africa, definitely take it "
