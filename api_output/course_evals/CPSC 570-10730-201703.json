            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n-Lots of algorithms, many of which are highly relevant to huge numbers of applications\r\n-Useful and mostly meaningful homework\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n-A few homeworks had sections which were mostly implemented by the instructors, and the students were supposed to fill in a few lines of code. Those didn't lead to much learning\r\n-The lectures and homeworks were often disorganized (irrelevant information sometimes, not enough other times)\r\n\r\nImprove:\r\n-Have a TA read through the slides and get rid of redundant information, and provide feedback on how to improve slides. They were really disorganized (often containing redundant information from multiple different other [properly-cited] sources, the order was not always very well-planned, they contained more information than the instructor could possibly cover, and even contained entire topics which were irrelevant to the course assignments, exams, and future lectures. If those topics were moved to the end in \"optional reading\" or labeled as \"optional\" in the slides, it would lead to less wasted time and stress on the students' part.).\r\n-Try the homework prior to having students do it. This will help find bugs in the implementation, or errors with dependencies etc. ",

The prerequisites are CSPC 201 and CSPC 202, yet the course requires an understanding of linear algebra and probability theory, neither of which are covered well in the prerequisites. The lectures skim over far too many topics, yet the problem sets expect us to know all the topics in great detail. The course would be much stronger if only a few topics were covered in greater depth. ",

I would prefer to focus on fewer things and go over them in depth with examples. \r\n\r\nI thought most of the homeworks were interesting, but sometimes confusing given that they were taken from different sources and inconsistent in the amount of work required as well as their relationship with lecture.

There is almost no overlap between them (which focus on neural networks and search algorithms) and the class material, which only touches on neural networks in a few slides.\r\n\r\nWhat will you learn? Lots about search algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS, Uniform Cost Search, Beam search), constraint-satisfiability (DPLL/SAT-solvers, genetic algorithms), Markov Chains, Markov Decision Processes, Bayesian networks, and some intermediate statistics.
