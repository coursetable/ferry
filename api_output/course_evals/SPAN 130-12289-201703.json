            "\u00a0I think I improved my writing and grammar the most. Was not any speaking component to the class besides in-class and a final oral exam. ",
            "\u00a0I feel much more comfortable conversing about everyday life in Spanish and using my skills outside of the classroom because I had so many casual in class conversations with Professor Carreras. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many more vocabulary words and reinforced my previous Spanish knowledge. I also got better at reading and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable speaking in Spanish and this helped by discussing the readings in class. ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my understanding of Spanish grammar, conversational skills, and writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more vocabulary, grammar, and culture of the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0biggest takeaway was an increased ability to speak and listen ",

            "\u00a0definitely covered all the basics of Spanish and tried to improve upon them. Definitely writing based. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good amount of work, regular tests/quizzes, only spoke Spanish during class ",
            "\u00a0I like that the class is small. It would be better if we were able to spend more time on some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the professor: Mercedes Carreras. She is truly one of the best people I have ever met, and I feel honored to have been in her class. She made me excited for class every day, and was always understanding, thoughtful, and engaging in everything that she did. ",
            "\u00a0It's mostly review of L1 and L2, and the only new material we learned was the conditional tense. Otherwise, the textbook we used mimicked that of L1/L2 a lot (the chapters, and therefore the vocabulary, had the same topics). I also wasn't able to do much speaking as I would have liked. It seems to be geared mostly at incoming first-years who have some Spanish background already to help them review and equip them with the necessary background for advancing to L4 and L5, but I wish there was an alternative for students who took L1 and L2 at Yale so we wouldn't have to spend an entire semester on basically just review. ",
            "\u00a0more vocabulary\r\nmore speaking tasks ",
            "\u00a0I loved that we talked about the film \"Even The Rain\" at the end of the course. I was surprised that my listening skills had improved so much over the semester. "

            "\u00a0yes. shores up and improves all around Spanish language skills ",
            "\u00a0Professor Carreras is extremely helpful and will make an effort to converse with you in Spanish outside of the structured curriculum. Because of this, you become more immersed in the language and have the opportunity to talk about everyday life with a native Spanish speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if someone wants to become a better Spanish speaker they should take this course ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful class and your speaking will improve a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- if you're interested in developing your Spanish skills, take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend it to incoming first-years who want to continue with Spanish, but it isn't very useful for students who've taken L1 and L2 at Yale since it's mostly review of L1 + L2. "
