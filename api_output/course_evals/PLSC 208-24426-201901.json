            "\u00a0I learned a lot about campaigns, political science in general (through reading many studies) and how to think about and evaluate data, relating it to campaigns. I think I also became a better thinker, more able to understand the dynamics of campaigns and better at accurately predicting. (or perhaps more often, knowing when I can't predict) ",
            "\u00a0Campaign strategy, what are some of the factors that voters look for, how to encourage voter turn out and persuasion ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the value of data in contextualizing political patterns, and developed a vocabulary for discussing things like the rural/urban divide, electoral math, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Information about campaigns ",
            "\u00a0Campaigns is the class to take if you're at all interested in political elections in the U.S. The breadth of the course is wide-ranging in that it covers both the theoretical and empirical aspects of national, state, and local elections and campaigns. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about how campaigns work. Really outstanding class. "

            "\u00a0The strength was Professor Mellman and all he brought, especially in terms of the knowledge he has. The biggest weakness was the group of students and the \"discussions we had.\" It was unclear to me why many of those people even bothered to come to class, and I was disappointed in the lack of detail or interesting ideas in many of our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very knowledgeable. However, there are sections of the class led by students which sometimes isnt as productive ",
            "\u00a0I think less time spent lecturing and more time spent discussing or applying the data to real-world examples would be helpful and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Last year students wrote that the greatest weakness of this course was the lack of discussion. As a result, Mark had students take turns leading discussion each week. Unfortunately, I still think there was a lack of good discussion in the class. The class would start each week with a not-great discussion of the readings, before turning into lecture. \r\n\r\nThe class's strength is when Mark tells stories about his time on campaigns. He should do more of that. ",
            "\u00a0Less class-led discussions, more feedback ",
            "\u00a0The course is really unique in its design as the first hour of every course is all student discussion centered on the day's topic/readings, with the discussions led by 2-3 student discussion leaders that rotate every week. The second hour is essentially a Mellman lecture which I enjoyed as he really is the person to learn from for all things campaign-related. ",
            "\u00a0The one weakness of this course was the student-led discussions. While breaking the class up between student-led discussion and teaching from the professor is well-meaning, many of the student-led discussions just scratched the surface of the readings. I learned a lot from Prof Mellman teaching, but not much from the student-led discussion. "

            "\u00a0Please just listen to the reviews and do not take this class. It is not worth it, and trust me, the professor is not worth it. Lots of people will shop this because of the professor but do not be one of those people. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I learned a lot about a topic that I love and got exposure to one of the leading campaign strategists in the country. It was also really nice to only meet once a week. ",
