            "\u00a0Weaknesses are that sometimes the information is common sense or terms that are important to know but very basic and tedious. Also, a lot of really important women's health issues weren't covered due to time in the semester. I think some topics could be switched out for topics that are more prevalent. Strengths are that the class is pretty small and so there is a lot of discussions that occur. Also, I loved learning how to write testimony because its a really important skill for working in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to take for an introduction on the health of women and children. Prof Lee is very knowledgable. Overall, the course assignments/exams could be improved by focusing more on analysis of the content rather than memorization of facts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the material is very interesting, well-organized, and comprehensive. A weakness is that we do not spend a long period of time focusing on a specific topic, which might be fun to do at least for one area of interest amongst students. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor introduced some really wonderful topics, the readings were well-curated, and it's a great introduction to maternal and child health. However, the subject was broad but not deep - some more depth would have been much better. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all of the topics as well as the guest lectures! ",
            "\u00a0Great course, just wish there was not a final written exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting topics and important material\r\nweakenesses- sometimes not presented in most engaging way ",
            "\u00a0poor and boring learning environment. Assignments were not a good assessment of course work mastery. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were Dr. Lee's expert knowledge and experience with the topic. It was so fascinating to learn from her because she did have real world experiences in both a clinical and public health department / advocacy perspective. More professors at YSPH should have real world experience like hers. I also really enjoyed the pace and timing of the content. I really also liked the two guest speakers - who both provided really helpful information. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that - at times - it was a little bit slow for students who already had some background in the topic. There could be more coordination with the core course EPH 510 (Health Policy and Health Care Systems) so there was less of a crossover. We could have gone in further detail into some of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed the concepts and topics of maternal, child, and infant health. The information from this class is important, affects a significant proportion of the population, and can be applicable in my future career. I felt the instructor was supportive and really engaged with the class. I enjoyed the guest speakers and the final exam tested on all concepts taught in class. \r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n-materials and concepts were interesting and important\r\n-researching about other countries and understanding how to advocate for a population/ condition was important to learn\r\n-class discussions were overall enlightening and engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I felt that the instructor or TF should have provided more of an overview on the class assignments; I didn't understand the importance or relevance for some parts of the assignments until after group discussion \r\n-While the TF was overall helpful in encouraging group discussion and providing feedback, I felt her presence in class was lacking. There were times when the instructor was having issues with the AV equipment and playing videos and the TF sometimes did not get up to help her or provide assistance ",
            "\u00a0I loved that we covered a broad variety of topics regarding MCH. The lectures were comprehensive and provided strong background information as well as the current state of the particular aspect of health we were discussing. Having the lecture slides printed out was fantastic for me specifically, it really helped my engagement with the class, material, and lectures. It was nice that there were a few assignments for the class, but we did not really get too much guidance in terms of the format of our submissions and the assignments themselves seemed to be slightly disjointed from the class theme and topics. The exam did not seem like a logical conclusion to the class, but studying for it did help me engage more with the content we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0A great review of important maternal and child health policies in the U.S. Provides a solid foundation in the area. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Lee is awesome and super nice. She is clearly passionate about women's health and it shows, making the environment and information presented really easy to learn and talk about. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Lee is very passionate and knowledgable about the health of women and children. Content is presented in a very clear way. Again, one small critique is to focus more on analysis of content rather than expect students to memorize facts. ",
            "\u00a0She is incredibly kind and approachable and knowledgeable, and she is always trying to get to know her students on a personal level which I appreciate since many professors don't do that. She is also very patient in answering any questions or looking up anything that she might not know the answers to and letting us know afterwards. Perhaps a more discussion-based style of teaching may be better. ",
            "\u00a0The class /semester schedule was very rigid - different than other YSPH classes I've experienced, some fluidity would be beneficial, and I think some more feedback and check-ins on performance throughout the semester would be useful. ",
            "\u00a0I really like Professor Lee, she is very supportive and knowledgable. ",
            "\u00a0So passionate and I learned so much from Professor Lee. ",
            "\u00a0Mary Alice is a personable professor who takes the time to relate to her students. She is obviously very knowledgeable about the field and has valuable practice in it which was an asset of the course. That being said, I wish she had more opportunities for critical thought and problematizing policies/politics rather than describing the status quo. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- knowledgeable and passionate about material\r\nWeaknesses- Tends to focus/get caught up on details that are irrelevant (e.g critiquing students for citations, formatting- e.g. things that are taught in highshool), and then brushes over actually important material like failing to provide more instructions on testimony that many were not familiar with ",
            "\u00a0Feedback was limited and not helpful. No office hours and very slow to respond to students ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Lee as I mentioned is an expert in her field. It was really fascinating and helpful to learn from her perspective and experiences. She was also excellent at providing feedback on course assignments. Her teaching style could be improved I think by going a bit faster with the content. Everyone who has taken the course should know the basics on Medicaid so it would be helpful if we could have heard more detail, either from her experiences or from other outside speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Lee is a great instructor. She really conveys her passion for the subject and getting her experience and expertise related to the class subjects was a great experience. I liked she took the time to learn everyone's names and encouraged discussion. I thought she presented course information in a way that was easy to understand and each class presented new information while still connecting it back to previous concepts. Overall, very nice and engaging instructor. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very well-versed in the topics that were discussed in class. If she did not know any of the information, it was followed up in an email or in the next class, which was very helpful. Her style of lecturing and discussion was beneficial for me particularly in terms of understanding and interacting with the information. The comments on my assignments were not very comprehensive and it was difficult for me to see where my grade came from. The review session before the exam was very helpful and helped me prepare and digest the course content. ",
            "\u00a0Mary Alice was so kind and brought in so much knowledge from her interesting career! She was a great instructor! "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. We do a lot of activities that are important to learn and I loved the environment. Everyone in the course had to choose a country and learn about maternal child health in their respective countries to discuss with the class. We also had to pick a women's health issue to testify and had to do so orally as well which was really cool to be able to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to take if you're interested in the health of women and children, applicable to all public health students, not just policy students ",
            "\u00a0A course that establishes foundational knowledge of women and children's health issues. I would recommend it to another student since it was a very focused topic and interesting to learn more in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0If you will be working in MCH, this course is a must-take and a great overview. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to other student, especially those who wants to work in the field of maternal and child health. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an overview of policies and health issues that affect women and children in particular ways that put them at risk of harm. The class has a very low workload and is relatively low stress, and for the assignments you get practice with an array of formats and get very thorough feedback. ",
            "\u00a0It is an important topic and interesting material, but the course could be more engaging ",
            "\u00a0This course is great if you are interested in one day working in a maternal and child health capacity - in any way. It is a great overview of the American health care system as it relates to maternal and child health as well. I would definitely recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in women, child, and infant health. The information learned in this class does provide foundational knowledge for maternal, child, and infant health, including important regulations and policy students may encounter in future careers. The instructor does a good job teaching the course and does encourage interest in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It was very informative and I learned a lot about the topic. The professor made it a very positive learning experience for everyone in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course looked broadly at many factors influencing the health of women and children, particularly in the United States, and I would especially recommend it for students who have a vested interest in maternal child health. "
