            "\u00a0I got an introduction to some of the data analysis techniques that are relevant to my field today. I also learned Python and got some practice working with a few different packages along with how to get the environment setup to work with them ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the mathematics behind PCA and neural nets, and how to use them for various things. ",

I thought the lectures were also a strength of the class. They were interesting and generally well organized.  Lin was also an amazing TF! ",
            "\u00a0It could probably be improved by giving an overview near the beginning of all the data science concepts we'll be going over. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Some of the most valuable lectures I've had.\r\nI felt the theory lectures were better than the hands-on lectures, but overall this course was superb. Left me with some big-picture concepts which I remember strongly and feel comfortable applying.\r\n\r\nI thought the homework assignments were pretty brilliant actually. I'd tell anyone interested in this field to take the class, it's unique in that it provides both solid theory and some very useful skills (e.g., Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, Regression) ",
