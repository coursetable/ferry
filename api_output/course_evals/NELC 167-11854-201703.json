            "\u00a0I feel that this course was excellent overall! It was a real treat to see such beautiful works of art and some older pictures that I likely never would have seen just reading about these topics online. My only criticism is that occasionally something was very obvious to Prof. Foster that was not very clear to the rest of us. I'm sure this is because she clearly is very knowledgeable on the subjects covered in this course, but I found it frustrating when the six of us were caught in a guessing game. I absolutely understand wanting her to engage us with the material and test our knowledge, but sometimes I genuinely felt we all would have been less frustrated if she just told us the answer she was looking for.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. I felt it was both relaxing and intellectually stimulating, which is a rare combination. However, I felt that I came into this class with relatively good writing and presentation skills. Two five page papers and a presentation does not sound like a lot, but Prof. Foster has rather high standards that I imagine would make this class a little stressful if you aren't confident in those abilities. That being said, I thought the course was fascinating and absolutely worth taking! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, only as a fifth class though. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for an easy 5th class, I would not recommend this course. You must be genuinely interested in the topics of the course if you wish to succeed. Professor Foster is very specific about what she's looking for in papers, and, like another reviewer pointed out, you will have to work for an A in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Foster is very sweet and cares a lot about what she teaches. She is very knowledgeable and can talk to you about anything under the sun that relates to ancient civilizations. "
