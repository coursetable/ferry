            "\u00a0I didn't like how opaque \"Insight\" point grading was. Additionally, it ends up being that most of your grade is due to the final, which puts a lot of emphasis on a relatively small part of the course.\r\n\r\nThe hands-on experiments are actually pretty fun! This lab helped me understand circuits much more than I did before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topic choices overall, good alignment with physics lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unencouraging and often patronizing demeanor of male TAs and instructors, lack of instruction/demonstration in handouts (EX: breadboard circuitry)\r\n\r\nI would recommend that all male TAs receive training on how to speak to students in a way that is neither patronizing nor discouraging (in fact, achieving the complete opposite would be nice). One of the TAs, during a practical practice session on Wednesday night, answered questions in a way that was so brusque and condescending that I considered leaving halfway through. A friend of mine felt the same. This is a systemic issue that I've noticed in the physics department and should not be acceptable, as it negates any of the positive effects of learning the content. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should be redesigned in a way that it is aligned with what we are learning in class. Personally, I found it easy because I have a greater background in physics but students who were seeing these concepts for the first time found it a bit hard. Ultimately, it's doable though. Also wish I could have more guidance on the insights section in lab reports- I felt it was so random and I was just guessing what to write. ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging and quite fair overall with the grading. A lot of the theoretical questions towards the end of the labs were interesting, although I often wished that the labs went into greater depth, particularly in the math. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There was always a TA or instructor to help clarify confusing concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of assumed knowledge for this course, that many people did not have, because this course did not line up well with the physics lecture.  I understand why the two courses maybe can't line up, but I think that instead of just assuming we would be able to understand all of the complexities of circuits, etc, it would be useful to have a small lecture before we began to go over key concepts. Our TA did this in some form, especially towards the end, but I think that they could have been more in-depth, since some of these topics can be very confusing. The pre-lab handouts introduced many new topics, so I think having a chance to discuss them in class would have been useful. The heavy focus on the oscilloscope was frustrating, and maybe we could have used further instruction on it, to understand what we were doing as we tried to get a clear picture of the waves we were studying. ",
            "\u00a0The material is not covered in the lecture 181 until after we do it in lab so much of lab time is spent answering questions.  There was not a single lab where I did not ask a question on every part and most groups around me had to do the same thing.  This caused lab to be very long sometimes when it otherwise would have been streamlined if we had more background knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Only meets for 3 hours, experiments usually finish early. Teachers (especially Sid Cahn) are always very helpful and can explain concepts thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab handouts sound a little condescending and the application of this class is relatively low. ",
            "\u00a0More use with oscilloscope. ",
            "\u00a0This class was tedious and time consuming and should count for 1 credit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths) Really reasonable experiments, workloads, and requirements. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses) Your experience depends largely on which TA you get. Sheridan, my TA however, was amazing. When we had substitutes because Sheridan was not able to make it, the class was poorly taught and confusing. Final exam generally much harder than anything done in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by better supporting information before hand. Many of the labs were difficult to understand before doing them in lab. The reason for this is because sometimes the lab course would not overlap with the lecture course so the only exposure we'd have to the topics would be a few pages in the course packet, which was not enough. I believe converting some of the information into a digital format with a lecturer and demos would be helpful in preparing students before lab.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement that could be made is in the grading for \"insight\" in lab reports. After taking PHYS 165 and 166, I've learned that the \"insight\" that is asked for isn't really insight but more so bullshit. If you're good at bullshitting, you'll get full insight points. While this discovery was good for my grades, it was a little disheartening to know that actual insight and understandings of the topics isn't what is sought.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be better coordination with the lecture courses. As previously mentioned there were times when lab would expose us to topics before lecture, yet try to build off of the topics it assumed we had learned. Frequently TFs and instructors would ask us if we had covered it in lecture already and I think that's something that should be communicated within the department beforehand. The PHYS 181 lecturer herself mentioned herself that she wishes she could organize a lab course that made more sense to her lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0The course has good intentions in that it intends to encourage students to learn to solve problems and draw relations between different physical phenomena. Still, I found that the lab handouts were often riddled with more questions than they were answers, making it extremely difficult for students with minimal physics background to keep up with other students (especially in cases where the material was \"presented\" before it was present in physics lecture). The result? A large majority of students end up completing each lab after spending hours waiting for their section's TA to come around and answer their questions throughout the lab section.\r\n\r\nThe course is advertised as a potential stand-alone course, but this is simply not the reality. If it truly is meant to be one, then the handouts should be changed to make them more accessible to students viewing the material for the first time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some sections did not include a mini pre-lab lecture before each lab, which I think would make the course more beneficial. Making these pre-lab lectures requirements for TAs of the course (and maybe even described on the syllabus) would allow students to get more out of topic and be better prepared to think through the concepts during the final lab practical. ",
            "\u00a0The content doesn't match up with the lecture course particularly well. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the lab course doesn't follow the timeline of either Physics class very well, which meant a lot of time was spent learning the concepts of the lab because they hadn't been covered yet. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped me to understand lecture material. However, we had to do a lot of stuff in lab way before we were introduced to it in lecture, which made some of the labs pretty confusing and stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Straightforward, low work load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Your enjoyment of the class and understanding of the material really depends on your TA ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: labs were well organized, instructors were clear\r\nWeaknesses: it was at times unclear what was expected from us ",
            "\u00a0The experiments aren't particularly interesting and aren't synced up with the material in the lecture series. This is not necessarily an issue, except the explanation given is pretty rudimentary in the lab handouts (it can't be that much more in-depth), and concepts don't get explained any further in lab. ",
            "\u00a0The lab reports are simple and short, but sometimes I felt that what we were doing was not helping me learn more about physics. ",
            "\u00a0The only merit of this class is that the only outside of lab work is a weekly one page lab summary which is busywork of little educational value or rigor.\r\n\r\nThe only way I could see this class be improved if it was turned over from Sid Cahn to Adriane Steinacker for a full redesign. Rather than learning about FFT graphs, beat frequencies, waves, and optics, it could actually be used to reinforce and emphasize the electricity and magnetism topics that we learned about in class. \r\n\r\nAlso, there was an especially odd somewhat sexual quotation at the end of one of the lab packets that is entirely inappropriate and should be removed. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness was that it did not correlate well with the things learned in lecture, it was too fast paced and you would have to apply concepts in lab that were not talked about in class, which made it much harder to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course isn't it's hands on aspect that allows students to visualize concepts, which makes them easier to grasp and comprehend. The weaknesses of this course are the lack of overlap between the lab and the lecture course. Although PHYS 171 and PHYS 166L were more closely in tune than their predecessors, there is still room for improvement. For example, topics were Simi liar but they were not timed accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course format is good. Its physics lab and you get out of it what you put in. ",

            "\u00a0Some of the portions of the rubric for lab reports aren't clearly stated as tasks in the lab handouts, and occationally the procedures are confusingly worded. Other than that the course was cleanly structured and overall good! ",
            "\u00a0The labs are reasonably varied, which keeps content changing, but they could get long. Additionally, I felt like the grading of lab reports - particularly the concept of \"insight\" - was often inconsistent and could be confusing. I did like that the labs were hands-on and often involved building circuits or telescopes or whatever else the lab may have required. ",
            "\u00a0This half of lab was much better than 165L. It is well structured, maybe just make the final more doable because it was very stressful, even with a lot of practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized and well-run. It's clear that the instructors have refined the class over time so that there aren't too many bumps along the way. Labs are more interesting than the ones from 165 (thankfully no more error propagation). My TA, Emma, was super sweet and helpful every time. Weaknesses: labs were sometimes worded a bit confusingly. There were parts that a lot of people got stuck on because they couldn't interpret what was being said in the lab procedure, which is worth revisiting. ",
            "\u00a0Often very abstract, but very little work outside of class ",
            "\u00a0The teaching fellows and course instructors were all very helpful in guiding us through the labs, especially when we got stuck or were confused by the instructions. In general, the course packets were pretty good EXCEPT the optics packets which were extremely confusing and hard to read. It would have been more helpful in the optics packets (and optics labs) had more examples, such as using the thin lens equation and drawing lens diagrams. The optics packets also appeared to have a lot of information deriving the Snell's Law which we ended up not using at all. Not having to do as much error analysis as 165L was much appreciated though! Weekly lab reports were a good way to summarize and review the material learned each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the labs are shorter this semester! You could also tell that they tried to make them more relevant for the premeds, who make up 100% of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the same dependence of your entire grade on your TA's level of strictness, the same bullshit final, the same tricky quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0It was a nice course! Run by good people and no complaints. ",

Weaknesses: Varying expectactions for the lab reports by TA, particularly regarding insight, were the most frustrating aspects of this semesters introductory lab course. Who you have as a TA should not be the determining factor regarding how many points are taken off for insight or other mistakes. This issue could be ameliorated by giving students clear expectations for what to include in the lab reports before writing the first one.  Moreover, the lab got way ahead of the lecture by the middle of the semester, and nothing was done to rectify this. Thus, it would be really helpful if the lab and lecture professors were in constant communication to ensure that students are learning the concepts in lecture before experimenting with them in lab.

The lab was also constantly ahead of the lecture material, so often students came in with no knowledge on the subject, making the labs more mindless, i.e. following steps, than meaningful. Especially in the case of optics, a subject not taught in the lecture, I had a very hard time grounding myself and understanding what was going on. Sometime, less would have felt like more in my opinion.\r\n\r\nMy main critique is in the way that the final is a practical exam. Throughout the course, we have learned to work in pairs, and in the end, we are made to separate and work under time-sensitive conditions. Frankly, it does not feel like this is at all a good way of testing lab capabilities. In a regular lab, you will always be working with others and collaborating. Of course, this makes it difficult to assess individuals by themselves, but I think just the weekly lab reports are a MUCH better representation of the work done over the course of the semester. The final is extremely stressful for students and feels out of left field in comparison to what we've been doing all semester. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 166L was very difficult for me to follow without any prior experience working with circuits, which is what the first half of the labs revolves around. I wish the class was better tailored to curriculum in Physics 181 or 171 (I took 181 concurrently with the lab) so that it isn't only the students who've already finished learning the material in previous years who can excel. I often relied on my partners to get through the circuits labs, which wasn't ideal for needing to do them alone later on during the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the experiments that focused on circuits and signals. One improvement that could be made to this area would be to connect what we learned about signals and circuits to the real world, such as by exploring radio signals. It would be cool to have a radio signal broadcast within the classroom and giving us an antennae and an appropriate receiving circuit which we could measure with logger pro.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class was the section on optics. I felt it was extremely cursory and not very well explained. We also don't learn anything about optics in physics lecture, so coming to lab and conducting experiments on something we don't understand was very frustrating. I came away from this class with useful knowledge of circuits and signals, but I definitely did not take away any useful knowledge of optics. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was being able to work with partners because talking through the experiments helped us work through them. One weakness is that the final exam did not seem entirely representative of physical knowledge and being unable to perform a specific task could put a bunch of other tasks in jeopardy. ",

            "\u00a0The experiments tend to talk about topics ahead of lecture so the material can be kind of confusing. My TA also wasn't the most experienced with these topics so the labs took a decent amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0As someone with absolutely no background in electronics, I found this course to be very challenging at times. The experiments were not aligned well with lecture, and I was often asked to take quizzes and perform labs on topics that I had never encountered in my previous studies. While this misalignment occurred occasionally in Phys 165, I found that topics in mechanics were much more intuitive and could be grasped merely through the brief lab manuals and via the experiment. In contrast, it was very difficult to understand what a capacitor was and how it worked, for example, without any formal instruction. To improve this course, I would suggest working with the introductory lecture instructors to ensure that lab material is covered in lecture before the week of the experiment. In addition, I would appreciate a very brief (perhaps 5-minute) lecture from the lab TA at the beginning of each lab period to review the concepts of the day's experiment and introduce any unfamiliar material before we take the quiz. I also rarely, if ever, received feedback on my work from my TA.\r\nFinally, I found the final exam, particularly the optics section, to be more challenging than expected. In my opinion, that portion of the exam tested aspects of optics that were not emphasized in the optics lab, unlike the other two sections, which seemed fair given our previous experiences.\r\nThe strength of this course was its senior faculty, all of whom were very friendly and knowledgeable teachers and who always went above and beyond to answer my questions thoroughly and in an understandable manner. The workload was reasonable for a half-credit course. ",

My TA Grant was fantastic, very fair, and made the lab a success. In general the labs were useful extensions of the lectures but there needs to be better overlap between the two. Also the final was far too hard compared to the difficulty seen in the rest of the semester. ",

It was completely out of sync with the PHYS 171 lectures, the experiments were ok but there should be much more guidance in the lab handouts because we had to constantly ask the TA for help and that really doesn't prepare us well for the final exam where you can't ask for help! I also think that having a final for that class is completely pointless and unnecessarily stressful - 3 hours is so little time to complete the 3 experiments and if you mess up on the tiniest step your grade for the whole semester will suffer! Especially since nothing we did over the semester prepared us for working on our own. ",

The experiments themselves were designed fairly well and were fairly easy to follow. However, major improvements could be made in terms of the lab's relatedness to lecture material. This is particularly a pacing issue; most weeks' labs covered material that had not yet been covered in lecture (or never would be), which is not fair to the students who struggle because the material is unfamiliar, and not fair to the TFs who have to teach material that they assumed the students would have had some exposure to. Additionally, the final exam environment is high-pressure and fast-paced--two qualities that do not mimic the work generally expected of students up to that point in the course. Therefore, many students (including myself) didn't feel prepared for the final, and found it especially unfair that it was worth so much of the final grade when we had been doing well so far. I found that the midterm exam in 165L was extremely helpful in alleviating some of the final exam anxiety. ",

Things start to get messy at the final, which I think is a very stressful and an inaccurate way of testing students. Essentially, you do 3 labs in 3 hours by yourself with some multiple choice questions, and this makes up a huge percentage of your final grade.

            "\u00a0You're probably taking Physics 166L because you have to, but if you're just considering it for a science credit, then make sure you're comfortable with working with circuits if you want an easier time. ",
            "\u00a0This is a standard physics lab and you're probably taking it as a requirement. It's a good class and similar to 165, just know the material is slightly more difficult to grasp conceptually. Beware the unit on optics: it's not covered in lecture and makes those experiments rather painful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it helped me understand topics in physics 2 that were important to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0not if you don't have to ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good lab. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good introductory physics lab course. I would recommend this lab option over the other choices available. The instructional staff is excellent, and the course is well organized with a manageable workload. The final exam can be challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it if you have to ",
            "\u00a0Required if you are pre-med, the workload is not too bad and while the final can be challenging, if you have a good TA this class is not too bad and is a useful extension of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0No. You only take this course if you must, and if there is any way to avoid, I implore you to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in introductory physics, engineering, or medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0If it is necessary to take for your major, then yes take it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good introduction to circuits and magnetism ",
            "\u00a0absolutely -- super easy course, really light workload, 20 min lab reports at most, finish lab in an hour each week, but the final exam is hella difficult ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to, it's pretty chill. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a fun course and not too much work. Definitely enhances your understanding of the material, especially for Physics 171. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to a student who wants to see how the concepts learned in the lecture course can be applied to our everyday lives. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, take it. Its a good into to E and M, and some of the concepts you learn help with Phys 181. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a doable intro physics lab that teaches you a lot and isn't stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if youre premed. better than first semester. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. Avoid if possible. Experience is very TA dependent. For example some TAs were more generous answering questions on final ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this lab, you probably need it. It's not terrible but I think your experience really depends on your TA. The instructors are all really nice. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, you have to take it. Not too bad though. ",
            "\u00a0if you didn't take 165L for some reason, don't be afraid to take this one. You'll have a little catching up to do logistically but the lab is very easy to get caught up on. this is a pretty chill lab class compared to others a premed might take like gen chem or even orgo lab ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, then you will have to take it. It's not a course I look forward to every Wednesday, but it's a good course to teach you skills. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to. It's not a particularly enjoyable lab even though the reports are really short and the labs 3 hours or less. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if it is part of requirement for med school or major. ",
            "\u00a0I mean I only took it because I was pre-med, and I knew that it couldnt be worse than Physics Lab 1 with Bonnie Fleming ( she is mean and also never saw her expect during the exam) ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you are an engineering major looking for a physics lab pre req. The workload is really light and the class is very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The lab does help to make some electricity concepts tangible, and the week-to-week work is pretty painless up to the point of the final exam. Most people take it as some sort of requirement, so generally not a waste of time and will probably be somewhat helpful. I didn't dread coming to lab! ",
            "\u00a0it's a prereq, won't eat up too much of your week ",
            "\u00a0This course is low stress with low a workload and relatively straightforward and easy. I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0You're probably taking physics lab because it's a requirement, so you have to take it whether you want to or not. It's not bad in terms of workload (a one page lab write up every week, final practical exam) and I hear it's easier than the other physics lab class. Your experience in this class kind of depends on the TF that you get, because some are better teachers than others. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have to ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student unless it is a requirement. It is a very long lab, and fairly boring. The final practical is very difficult as well. ",
            "\u00a0I mean you probably have to take it and its not the worst ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a nice supplementary lab course to PHYS 171/181. The lab often introduces concepts earlier than lecture, which gives you a chance to understand lecture material in a hands-on environment. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it's somewhat interesting and not very hard; it's a good way to get practical experience with circuits ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, take it. Its fine. Interesting subject matter and Ive to have hands on experience. Take it with 171 if you can because there is a better correlation of material. ",
            "\u00a0Unless necessary for a requirement, I would not suggest taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're taking Phys 171 and need it for whatever reason (pre-med, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Yes this class is great. And yes, you're probably taking it because it's required and not because you want to, but you'll have a good time all the same. The material is interesting and the expectations and assignments are very clear. ",
            "\u00a0Unless it is mandatory, I would not recommend taking this lab course. You are honestly better off just watching YouTube physics lab videos online. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if required, as you will not gain a lot of insight. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they wanted a useful course to take concurrently with the physics lecture classes. It is not terribly difficult and I feel like I learned a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Other than how to use a few tools, I don't feel like I gained a lot of knowledge from the course, even though I did try my best to understand the topics beforehand. ",

            "\u00a0It's a requirement most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it teaches you useful knowledge, ",
            "\u00a0Since the experiments are mostly not very exciting or cool, this isn't a fun class to take if you do not need it to fulfill a requirement. "
