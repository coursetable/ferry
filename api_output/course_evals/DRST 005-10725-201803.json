            "\u00a0This course was always fun and the discussions were often quite interesting, however, I don't feel that I developed any skills in taking it. My writing ability may have marginally improved but the edits on papers were often quite stylistic and not directly applicable as improvements for the next paper. Our discussions on the text often ventured quite off course. ",
            "\u00a0I caught a glimpse of an expansive history of the western canon while writing various essays. There is not much tangible knowledge that one retains, but a slight general improvement in workload management and critical thinking is a definite result. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I gained an ability to make historical connections I previously had not had. It was this course that made me feel comfortable in DS and comfortable sharing my thoughts at Yale going forward. In addition, the reading responses enabled me to find a way into texts I may otherwise have responded less to. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to synthesize the views of canonical thinkers from Plato to Maimonides. Also to recognize how the philosophy of history and of political thought changed over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a better understanding of how to evaluate political events and the individuals within them as it relates to the context of the Greek, Roman, and Medieval texts that we were reading. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies H&P is not a mere class on history; it is a vast overview on how historians and political philosophers have thought, from Herodotus and Aristotle in ancient Greece to Livy and Tacitus in Ancient Rome to Augustine and Aquinas in the advent of Christianity. DS is instrumental for an education at Yale; my reading, writing and speaking skills have drastically improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to look critically at a historical source, but it also teaches you how to see themes within the work and across works over the course of the semester. The themes of the course are fascinating: human nature, the nature of democracy and tyranny, the best governments, the role of philosopher/ruler in government. While the original texts are not always an engaging read, the discussions are. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the historical and political foundations of western thought, from Plato to Maimonides. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze historiography and political trends. ",
            "\u00a0Developed writing and synthesis skills. Had little prior knowledge of classical history, and that was developed through this course. ",
            "\u00a0History and Politics of the Greek and Roman world; some from the Islamic tradition as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage in close reading of historical texts and engage in thoughtful discussion with my peers. "

            "\u00a0Professor Freedman was a very fun professor and he quite clearly cared a great deal about our class. Our discussions usually started in the text but simply drifted outside the text to other topics (fun, of course, but not really educational). If we could have stayed in the text more, and done more close reading of the text, I would have appreciated it.\r\n\r\nThe course probably spent too long on certain topics and skimmed over others too quickly. Agricola may have been important, but a full class was probably too much time for it. I would have appreciated better spacing and pace for the selection of authors for the final. We were expected to write basically on three authors among Augustine, Al-Farabi, Maimonides, and Aquinas for the final exam and three from before. We spent 3 weeks on the first 3 and 11 weeks on the other authors, so a more even split for the selection might have made studying easier. ",
            "\u00a0Again, as with all DS classes, the pacing acted almost as a negative feedback loop where the sheer quantity increasingly diminishes the possibility of quality work in terms of reading and writing. If one were to decrease the workload and give more time and opportunity for feedback on each essay, I believe that there would be an increased level of engagement, productivity, and tangible learning that all of us would appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a wonderful overview, enjoyable for its breadth in terms of the style and personality of its authors. At times, the amount of reading was very difficult especially at the beginning, when we first read Herodotus and Thucydides. It was, though, the liveliest and most fun course of my first semester. The class dynamic was warm and invited creative thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the course could focus a bit more on the validity and soundness of the ideas presented. certainly, when reading a historian, the aim will be more about understanding what kind of political views they present rather than the quality of those views. However, when reading a political theorist, I would've liked a bit more critical engagement with the ideas themselves.\r\n\r\nWith regards to strengths, it really helps one handle big reading loads and pull ideas from historical writing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freedman is beyond wonderful. A great storyteller, and gifted with concision-- gets right down to the important questions and ideas. Sometimes we got a little off track, admittedly, but often in an illuminating fashion. It is hard for me to point to weaknesses considering the strength of our class-- really a powerhouse group, willing to work together and build off each other's ideas. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of covering certain major periods in Greek and Roman history, but could benefit from touching upon the major gaps that it leaves in the chronology, particularly the Hellenistic period with Alexander, and the entire early-Medieval that is skipped over. ",
            "\u00a0DS in general provides an expansive breadth of content, at the expense of depth. I have learned about the basic principles of many thinkers in the West, and while I wish we could talk more about the works we read, I realize there is not enough time to talk about everything. I wish that the amount of class time was proportionate to the amount of pages we have to read. ",
            "\u00a0The works very clearly build on each other (the authors use their predecessors as references points, and the themes are consistent throughout). Sections of the works could be cut out because they are just retellings of irrelevant stories, and this would make the reading experience more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths were certainly in the small discussions. I learned more from my peers than I expected at the beginning of the course. The course's weakness was certainly the selected readings. I often felt like the excerpts that we read were of little importance to the lecture and to class discussions. For example, we were asked to read a long excerpt from Augustine's City of God -- certainly an important read -- but the excerpt included a lengthy discussion of twins and their birth. Despite reading nearly 10 dense pages on the nature of twins and astrology, it was never mentioned in class and never appeared on the exam or in a lecture. I think the course could have been improved not by less reading but by different excerpts from the same books. Overall, though, the course was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the course material. The weaknesses are being thrown into essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0It is good as is. ",
            "\u00a0I would say the strengths and weaknesses of this course go hand and hand, as the strengths are derived from the volume of texts I gained exposure to, while the weaknesses spring from the speed at which the course moves through the text, at times sacrificing depth for breadth. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes-- if one would enjoy the same classes that DS offers and is willing to make the sacrifice of other classes while valuing the quantity of work over meticulous analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Perhaps it is the most grab-bag of the three DS courses, but for that reason the most interesting. ",
            "\u00a0yes. I still learned a lot about these texts, and discussions were certainly illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Professor Freedman to anyone interested in ideas, and anyone who likes to eat, i.e. practically everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they were interested in delving deep into Greek and Roman politics to better understand how to interact with our political situations today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend DS to every Yale student. The way in which the books converse with each other really shows, especially in H&P. This course in particular is vital for future political leaders; by examining past human experiences, we are able to form our own and decide how to live our lives. It is an examination of practical wisdom throughout the centuries in hope that we gain and apply our own practical wisdom. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you want a strong foundation in ancient history and ancient history-telling. It is a lot of work, but the discussions are worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone interested in political science would probably like this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the content is excellent; the people at DS do a great job. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! This course has been the most concentrated learning experience I've had thus far. I have deeply enjoyed being a part of a community of engaged peers and professors who are all striving to advance each other's learning and understanding of the texts at hand. I think Directed Studies generally is one of the most distinct and special programs Yale has to offer. "
