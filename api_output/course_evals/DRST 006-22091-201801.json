            "\u00a0I learnt so much about political philosophy and intellectual history in this course. I definitely developed my ability to synthesise and reconstruct and evaluate arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I developed great insight into questions about modern political thought. ",
            "\u00a0This course entirely changed my political thinking. We studied political theories of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and many more. I feel more equipped to understand our society, our prejudices, our desires, and our goals. This is the most insightful course in DS. ",
            "\u00a0H&P second semester is much more explicitly political than historical, but still is a useful and interesting window into the political world that we have come to exist in today. Post-DS, I certainly understand general political obstacles, issues, and veins of thought in a way I did not before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the origins of political thought in the modern Western tradition, which has already been really useful! This course offers a great curriculum, and has given me much better tools with which to think about modern political issues today. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of the second half of the DS curriculum in Western historical and political thought. "

            "\u00a0seminars need way more energy. ",
            "\u00a0The sections and lectures in this course are incredibly engaging and help you to better understand what the important parts of thinkers' arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the range of texts read, as well as the level of attention given to each. Attempts were obviously made at diversity, with DuBois standing out. However, it was a bit disappointing that a professor with more expertise on DuBois (perhaps an African American Studies professor) did not give the lecture on his Souls of Black Folk, especially because the students were perhaps the most excited they have ever been about a book. This is something that should be looked into for next year as there definitely are faculty members available (e.g. Crystal Feimster). ",
            "\u00a0I think we need to talk more about strategies of how to tackle reading the texts. The lectures and seminars were fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum is excellent and well designed. At points it can seem a bit erratic, since whatever doesn't fit into the other two categories seems to go into H&P, but everything we read was fascinating and really useful! Being in such a small seminar with an excellent professor is an amazing experience, and I got wonderful personal feedback on my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Oskian has a wealth of knowledge that goes far beyond the books. Her answers to questions are bolstered by outside resources that truly do make the class a more comprehensive history of political thought. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often times class felt more like a lecture than a conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The course has strong material and an obviously knowledgeable instructor. However, the structure of seminars wasn't always conducive to full engagement from the class. We would usually read a passage then be asked about our thoughts or questions, one or two people would speak, and then we would receive a five-minute explanation/elaboration from the professor. It seemed that oftentimes class would turn into a small lecture. Also, papers were often returned very late and with somewhat vague feedback. "

            "\u00a0If you take this course be prepared for A LOT OF READING. That said, the lectures and seminar discussions are so interesting that it's worth the hours you spent each week hunched over a DS book. You learn so much about political philosophy and intellectual history - I would definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is a great introduction to the type of work discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, it opens your mind to new perspectives and helps you understand the context of your own lifestyle and opinions. It's a lot of work, but it is most important. Don't take this for prestige or whatever, take it to make yourself better. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! As I said earlier, I really enjoyed this class and the material that we learned. The experience of this seminar (and of DS in general) was an absolutely integral part of my freshman year and one that I dearly loved. ",
            "\u00a0Not necessarily. I don't know if it was the time frame or just an unenergetic class, but it seemed to be hard to get anything out of the seminar that I wouldn't have gotten from simply reading the assigned texts by myself. "
