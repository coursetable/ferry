            "\u00a0We examined the history of vaccines and vaccination programs, with a particular focus on the 20th and 21st centuries and on the historical roots of contemporary issues in U.S. and global vaccination policy. I gained a thorough, historically grounded understanding of the scope and design of vaccination efforts, past and present, and the interconnected social, cultural, and political issues that vaccination has raised throughout its history and continues to raise today. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned so much about the different ethical, economic and political issues that go along with vaccines. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history vaccination both past and present. Also, provided great context for the current vaccine debate ",
            "\u00a0How to approach a politically charged scientific question; this lesson is very important and I will carry it into the future, looking at many public health and environmental questions in a historical way which enables me to understand the truths, distortions, and the consequences of debates. \r\nI also learned a lot about medical historical research of primary sources. \r\nDeveloped skills of anticipating counter-arguments and forming arguments. \r\nGained knowledge regarding the attenuation of pathogens and the creation of vaccines, early institutes of Pasteur and Koch, the historical role of European, American and Russian public health campaigns, the adverse reactions of DPT, rotavirus and polio vaccines in the US, the complexities and sexism of the parent-patient relationships tested by vaccination, the rages of global epidemics, and the results of the smallpox and polio eradication campaigns (among many others). ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater appreciation for the complexities surrounding vaccine use and development. ",
            "\u00a0We read and discussed the complex history and themes surrounding vaccination such as the benefits and hinderances of compulsory vaccination programs across centuries, efforts for global eradication of infectious diseases, and reasons behind antivaxxer sentiments held by a small but growing number of people today. ",
            "\u00a0\"Vaccination in Historical Perspective\" was a terrific course. I learned a tremendous amount about the history and debate surrounding vaccines and vaccination policyboth in the US and around the world. The history of vaccination is a worthy subject in its own right (vaccines are likely the greatest public health triumph of the last century), but also a window into exploring a whole host of other topics. This includes the interface of politics and public health, science in public discourse, the promises and limits of government power, the role of media, the legitimacy of experts and expertise, and much more. Accordingly, even though I don't have a science background or plans for going into medicine, I found HIST 403J to be an incredibly rich educational experience. "

            "\u00a0I loved the structure of this course. The readings were fair in length and the discussion of the seminar were incredible. We would all write reading responses the night before on the readings and pose questions to prompt discussion the next morning. It was incredibly thought out and made for truly successful discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wide breadth of vaccination material, great instructor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: repetitive and super America focused ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material is very interesting, the assignments and readings are great, and the course is narrowly focused enough that youll actually acquire a lot of retainable knowledge. Professor Schwartz is extremely knowledgeable and has a (lengthy) answer to most questions. He begins class by covering relevant stories from the news, something I now wish every professor would do.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class didnt always make the most of the seminar structure. First, its always a bit weird being in a seminar classroom for an entire semester without learning peoples names. I wish Professor Schwartz would have facilitated that, e.g. by requiring us to say our name before talking for the first couple of weeks. Second, student comments were almost *always* directed at Professor Schwartz and not at each other. I wish Prof. Schwartz would have encouraged more discussion between students, e.g. by asking us to take a stance on an issue, or asking if anyone disagreed with a statement every once in a while. We had some great students in class, who often made insightful comments, but I still wish Prof. Schwartz had pushed back more often, instead of merely nodding and expanding with knowledge of his own. There were some topics - the limits of public health legislation, the merits and downsides of global health efforts, etc. - where we could've had a very stimulating discussion if students had been encouraged to present their opinions and stand by them, as opposed to just provide insightful comments or perspectives.\r\n\r\nOh, and one other thing: the handwritten comments on my papers were pretty much illegible. ",
            "\u00a0Strong course, founded on student discussion and engagement with historical and scientific works. \r\nWeaknesses lie in the discussion's inability to assess historical facts independent of present controversy. While this is, of course, largely due to the nature of our time, and looking at the current controversy through its history can be a good thing, such controversy can also prevent students from fully voicing ideas or of engaging fully with all stakeholders. This is merely an observation and in no way condemns the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all of the reading material for the course and thought it was well organized. I found little room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: relaxed open discussion\r\nweakness: could be slightly more structured to facilitate student learning ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Professor Schwartz is an excellent instructor and seminar leader\r\n-I thought the syllabus was well-structured. I like that the course offered both chronological and thematic views of vaccination history\r\n-I also really liked the mix of assignments (weekly readings, reading responses, 2 papers, and a final essay)\r\n-The trip to the Medical History Library was a highlight\r\n-I really like how we began each class with contemporary vaccination news stories that connect to historical themes\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Improvement:\r\n-I wish there had been more of an opportunity to build a sense of class camaraderie. While I knew who most people were by the end of the semester, I wish I had gotten to know them better. Perhaps we could have had a class dinner and/or similar community-building events. Other seminars have taken this approach and to positive effect\r\n-It would have been interesting to learn more about the development of vaccination history (as a scholarly field) and how the history of science and medicine has been used to inform/influence public health policy today "

            "\u00a0yes yes yes yes. Professor Schwartz is absolutely incredibly. He cares about you as a student and a person. He challenged us to think outside the box when it came to the topics around vaccinations. If you are pre-med or interested in public health..take this course. you will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend to every student at Yale! Even if you are not that interested in public health, Professor Schwartz leads such great discussions about vaccines, why they matter, and how public perception of vaccines has been shaped  since their creation. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are super passionate about vaccination otherwise it might be repetitive ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend! Super important and interesting topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Extremely interesting and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0take it if you get in - professor schwartz is wonderful and the class is a great opportunity to broaden your perspective on issues in vaccination ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to any student interested in the subject material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seeking to learn more about the history and themes surrounding vaccination. This class provided students the opportunity to engage with literature about vaccines and to discuss their opinions about the subject matter in a relaxed setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. The history of vaccination is such a fascinating topic, and HIST 403J offers a great overview of the key ideas/events/themes, etc. The history of vaccination is a worthy subject in its own right (vaccines are likely the greatest public health triumph of the last century), but also a window into exploring a whole host of other topics. This includes the interface of politics and public health, science in public discourse, the promises and limits of government power, the role of media, the legitimacy of experts and expertise, and much more. The course syllabus was excellent, and the workload (weekly readings, short reading responses, 2 papers, and a final essay) was enjoyable and manageable. In addition, Professor Schwartz is a terrific professor and seminar leader. He boasts an impressive command of the material, and his enthusiasm for the course was infectious. In short, highly recommended! "
