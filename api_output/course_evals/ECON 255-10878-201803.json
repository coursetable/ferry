            "\u00a0This course taught me all about finance from both a conceptual and quantitative perspective. In the beginning, we went over how do \"balance\" a balance sheet, then we went over annuities and perpetuities, then we went over how to find the price and/or yield-to-maturity of bonds, then we went into capital budgeting, then measuring the Beta and weights of stock portfolios, then we covered Modigliani-Miller, then we finished out by going over options and put-call parity. All of this came with conceptual and finance-law related questions as well. This course was useful in that it introduced me to financial concepts and also taught me how to apply them. Those skills may get rusty, but many of the underlying principles may stick with me. ",

This included an extension of the ideas of the time value of money, valuation and discounting, bond pricing, portfolio and arbitrage theory, derivatives, and more. All of these concepts were explained in detail from the beginning, with good descriptions of any necessary jargon, mathematical bases, and real-world examples. ",

            "\u00a0The course seemingly covers a lot of material but retrospectively, I feel like we ended up talking about certain concepts (like benefits of debt/equity, principal-agent problem) over and over again. The strengths of the course include the engaging lecture and the great TAs. The problem sets and exams were pretty fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Pascutti is an absolute gem. Very engaging lecturer and all around good guy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting material, good professor, problem sets good preparation for exams, challenging, etc. \r\nWeaknesses - the curve. Professor Pascutti said at the beginning of the semester that he wanted this class to be everyone's top priority and that he discouraged anyone from taking the class Credit/D. However, the curve is so harsh--only 15% get As--that many people felt discouraged and decided to take it Credit/D. Despite the fact that people were doing much better on the tests this year than last--something Professor Pascutti himself noted--the curve remained set in stone, further discouraging people from taking it for a grade and fully engaging with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, grading was super harsh on midterms, and I don't usually notice that, but the TAs seemed very unsympathetic to small mistakes. Pascutti makes lectures interesting and engaging. Problem sets are super time consuming, but overall worth taking as an econ elective. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed working with my TA and working through the problem sets. The professor is very knowledgeable about the finance industry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TF's in this course were a godsend.  I had Emily, and honestly I don't think I will ever have a better TF again.  She was patient, knowledgeable, and always on top of things in section.  Prof. Pascutti is great at explaining complex financial concepts in very intuitive ways.  Lecture was always fascinating and you didn't want to miss it for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exams are written to the full time, so it's hard to finish them.  The topics tested are well-covered in class, so the exams are really an evaluation of how quickly and accurately you can solve problems.  Curve is a bit tough with a lot of finance hardos (i.e. Econ majors who can't imagine not graduating Summa) but studying hard and attending lecture will prepare you decently.  Prof. Pascutti's organization was a bit haphazard: psets and exams often had typos and sometimes missing information, and the course is very front-loaded (7 psets that are all finished before the second midterm).  Also, psets could take incredibly long amounts of time to do a bunch of the same problems over and over, which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well organized and well taught. Professor Pascutti makes lectures interesting and fun while making the material clear and easy to understand. The tests were very fair and the TAs helped a lot in explaining any difficult concepts. I don't have any major criticisms of the class at all, it was just about everything I would want in an Intro to Corporate Finance class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pascutti is a great lecturer. But you have to remain focused and pay attention throughout lecture, because his lecture slides are different from the notes. The material is also interesting, and the tests are very fair. Weaknesses: the final was really long. ",
            "\u00a0The course was done very well. One thing that could be considered for the future is developing more of a structured program for the course. Especially when it came to exams it was sometimes a little challenging to piece together an overall structure for what to study, apart from just going through lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0Very useful information that Professor Pascutti explains in a way that is easily understandable. The only weakness in his teaching is that you must be fully engaged in every lecture, as he lectures almost exclusively through his words and math/concepts written out on the chalkboard. There are no real helpful slides on Canvas that you can go back to to enhance your understanding when necessary. Great stuff, but don't miss a lecture or zone out while there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pascutti knows what he's talking about, and is friendly and engaging in office hours. The material makes sense, and the problem sets were very useful for the final.\r\nWeaknesses: Once I fell behind, it was very hard to catch up. Much of the knowledge is cumulative, so any gaps will have an outsized effect. The problem sets were also extremely long (8-12 hours). The second midterm was especially difficult, even days of studying could not get me a good grade (or even close to a good grade). ",
            "\u00a0It would be a lot of work if you're not already familiar with a lot of these concepts, might be a goof idea to take it after Financial Theory and/or Financial Markets. But it gives a really good sense of how things work in the real world. Pascutti is an amazing lecturer and his stories are hilarious. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like it was too math-intensive at times, the homeworks emphasized math too much and didn't have a lot of qualitative stuff even though that was a decent potion of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures did seem a bit unstructured I admire Professor Pascutti's ability to teach from his vast amount of knowledge but not following a strict outline, especially with the non-math concepts, was a bit difficult. ",
            "\u00a0It was strong in its content, its teaching style with Professor Pascutti, and its focus on learning a lot of content in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nThough of course, these are not direct weaknesses, the class was significantly more work than expected, especially compared to other economics courses at Yale. It was quite fast paced and would be difficult for most that do not have a strong foundation in accounting and statistics before taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyable class! ",
            "\u00a0The class has an excellent, well-organized, and transparent structure. The textbook helps with the problem sets, and class discussions help narrow down what exams will focus on. A weakness is the disparity between TAs. My TA was great! But when I had to reschedule for a different TA, I realized that the other TA straight up was solving the problem sets for the students and giving them lists of what material would be covered on tests. It didnt feel fair after that. Another issue was signing up for TA office hours. If the sign up sheet is posted for the whole semester in like October, one person can sign up for one of only five slots every week for the whole semester while other students wouldnt even get one. Also, the law school dining hall is an ineffective location for office hours. If many students have the same question, a chalkboard might be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A little disorganized but nothing to report, ",
            "\u00a0I honestly cannot think of any strength. Maybe that the instructor was very engaging and hilarious. That said sometimes the way he answers the questions makes it seem like he's kind of condescending. Like you would ask him a clarification and he would say \"well what does it say?\" as if you're an idiot for not understanding it.\r\n\r\nWeakness: he asks you of stuff that he briefly mentions in class so you have to show up and takes notes carefully. I honestly don't like this. If it's important put it on the slides. Secondly, the TAs don't give a fuck about the class. You would send a question to the TA and she would never respond to you. Your email is lost in the void of the universe. Office hours are made in a 15 minute slot, so it's always rushed an the person ahead of you probably stalls, so your time is cut short. ",
            "\u00a0Although Professor Pascutti is a very eloquent speaker and has a lot of interesting stories to share, he sometimes goes on tangents, which could be avoided by preparing and structuring each lecture slightly more. A lot of your learning and success in the class depends on your TF, who is supposed to cover the calculations (which form the basis of the PSETs and exams) during section, yet not all TFs are equally committed and knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by being more organized. If Pascutti actually followed his lecture slides, it would make the course 2x easier. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the professor was very organized in lecture material. However, I wish he took advantage of the large screen (instead of using whiteboard many times) ",
            "\u00a0The course had a very engaging instructor, and the TAs (Yale Law School students) were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat interesting lectures, but the material isn't very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0All the material was fair  nothing tested was ever out of the blue, and Professor Pascutti was quite thorough in his lectures. He didn't use Powerpoint, which to me was a plus, as it kept people engaged, and always put down a 'roadmap' of sorts at the beginning of every class to make sure he covered everything he wanted to cover. The biggest strength is probably that this is a solid survey course on finance that covers a wide range of material at just the right amount of depth. It lays down a pretty solid foundation for future finance-related courses. Also, his lecture notes, posted on Canvas, were very thorough. As for the weaknesses, I sometimes got the feeling that the TAs didn't know what they were doing  they were law school students, so their training wasn't directly related to what they had to teach us during discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0Textbook is very good, and the professor adds nice color to this based on his career experiences and current events. ",
            "\u00a0Moves slow at times and the content is pretty easy.  Problem sets are too long. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the mix of learning the math behind finance and listening to Pascutti's stories/scenarios about the industry ",
            "\u00a0The TAs were super helpful and I thought that Pascutti did a great job of teaching the course in an engaging way by integrating real life examples and looking at companies that the class was familiar with. Some questions on the test were really specific and on stuff that got glossed over in class, but otherwise I thought it was pretty fair. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very well connected with real world cases. Problem sets, however, are often not clearly worded, and there are frequently mistakes on solution keys. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pascutti is great and puts a lot of effort into his classes, but without a section that is actually helpful, it is really to difficult for students. The concepts behind psets and useful formulas should be explained better during section because otherwise students have to do a lot of self-studying. The exams are really hard, especially conceptual things, but the problems given are very similar to psets. So, if you put in the work you will do decently well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0PSet distribution unbalanced (too many at beginning of semester and too few at end) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good range of basic financial knowledge. You'll come out feeling like you know something. Friendly class environment. Teacher is clearly willing to help students. Psets were good practice and the answer keys had great explanation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures lacked a clear overall structure, TA office hours were inconvenient to attend, and exams were very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the balance of in-class examples from the \"real world\" and also reviewing concepts during lecture was very good. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecture, problem sets are good ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is Professor Pascutti and his team of TFs. Professor Pascutti offers well-taught and entertaining lectures and the TFs are excellent in clarifying material and working through examples during Discussion Sections. To improve this course, I think Professor Pascutti could be more organized in what he covers and when he covers certain material. A way to do so could be by outlining the how the class will progress and how the different topics are connected, how one subject may lead (or not) to another. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the professor is very passionate and willing to spend extra time helping you in office hours. he truly wants you to learn the material rather than focus on the grade. \r\n\r\nweakness: the TAs vary tremendously in their knowledge of the course. the more involved TAs will tell you specific topics you do and don't need to know for the exam. to my detriment, it wasn't until the final that I sought out help from one of the more knowledgable and involved TA's. this puts some students at a significant advantage. the class covers a lot of material and the lectures are not always easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Make it more modern. I would suggest substituting long and pointless calculations by hand with case analysis in Excel. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you have a background in finance. Coming in without even knowing what \"equity\" is, I felt very behind in the class. There's a lot of catching up to do, since a lot of people in the class are to-be finance bros and/or already have background in the field. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the material, yes. The problem sets seem difficult at the time, but section was really helpful in covering whatever wasn't covered in class. The midterm exams are fair and had no surprises. ",
            "\u00a0yes! it was definitely tough so it has to a priority but learned a lot. Would especially recommend to students looking to go into finance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Whether you are considering consulting or finance or any other position that will require general business knowledge, this course is a great introduction. It's certainly challenging and the curve is tough but the skills you learn are worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Beware the curve and consider credit D'ing, but you learn super-practical stuff about the way the financial world works. Very much worth taking as an econ elective, and the material is accessible enough for non-majors as well. ",
            "\u00a0yes, I would recommend this course to any student thinking about entering the Finance industry or just interested in Finance in general. This is a great Intro to Finance course that really covers a lot of material in 1 semester. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a solid introduction to finance in general, definitely take this course.  You'll learn a ton and actually enjoy the professor.  If you're looking for just another Econ field course, maybe choose something else. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in finance, I think the course is a great introduction into the material. While the class moves a bit fast at times, the TAs are usually very responsive and the exams are pretty reasonable and based on pset material. It isn't an easy class, but if you are engaged in lectures and ask questions when necessary, it's a great class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Pascutti is a great teacher and explains the math behind concepts very well. He also does a great job at connecting what we learn in class to actual things you'll see on the news/on the job. Don't expect this class to teach you what you need to learn for job interviews..go memorize an interview guide for that. This is a great choice for an econ elective for anyone who wants to learn the basics of corporate finance (accounting, valuation, option pricing are the major themes). There are 7 psets. Each are extremely long, will probably take an entire afternoon. Midterms and finals are very fair and similar to practice material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, anybody interested in understanding finance (including personal finance) should take this course (not just people interested in working in IB etc.). The course is helpful in both understanding how the financial world works, but also in how specific financial products work, which I'm guessing will be quite helpful after graduating from Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you intend to use finance in your career. You will learn very useful stuff, but if you don't need it then the level of engagement isn't worth it, as it's much more in-depth than a course should be if you just want to take it for fun and learn something new. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Although I learned a fair amount about finance, it was not worth the struggle and disorganization of the professor and class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not an economics major, I would not take this course for a letter grade. It is useful for being introduced to financial concepts, but you will be tested rigorously on the material. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Great class in the econ department, very applicable skills, amazing lectures! Go for it if you're not scared of doing lots of computations. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in any career in business or finance, it will give a great overview and introduction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! While this course requires a lot of time, dedication, and effort, the payoff is huge! I would highly recommend this course with Prof. Pascutti to all ECON majors. The material learned in this course is very relevant to economics in general, and I am walking away from this course with a greater appreciation for and understanding of finance. ",
            "\u00a0People give this class a bad rap often for Pascutti.  The concepts in the class can be tough, especially for those new to the material.  Regardless, the class is not like physics or calculus- if you put enough time in (say three hours a week outside of lecture) you'll probably do just fine (meaning at least an A-).  If you see a lot of bad reviews, I wonder how many of those are from students who didn't go to lecture... ",
            "\u00a0This is a really valuable course to take, given the amount of basic fundamentals that you learn about finance through this class in a low-stakes environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are at all interested in finance and are willing to put in a solid amount of work, this class is great and will teach you a lot about the theory and basics of finance. While it obviously won't teach you to be an investment banker or go into sales and trading, it does a great job of forcing you to understand how finance works. ",
            "\u00a0100 percent recommend with Pascutti. I thought the class would be pretty dry, but Pascutti is incredibly passionate and humorous. He really emphasizes connecting current events to what we are learning in class. He also makes students actually read 10Ks, uses real-life examples for explanations, and is overall extremely engaging. Most of the concepts learned in this class are also probably directly applicable for a career in finance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Professor Pascutti was very helpful and invested in student engagement and learning. If he has office hours I strongly suggest going to them. While people say the class is super hard, the class actually tells you exactly what is required of you which is a huge relief makes it straightforward to prepare. The tests are reasonable and the content is interesting. It starts off very fast but soon slows a little and you adjust to the pace. ",
            "\u00a0I guess, if you're interested in finance. If you're not, take it CR/D/Fail. It's so not worth the trouble, which is kinda sad. Or get a study group, because you won't really learn from just lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you're considering going into finance. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this class, regardless of whether they're interested in finance or not! Though Pascutti is a bit disorganized, he really knows his stuff and his lectures are quite interesting. Most of the conceptual questions for the midterms and final came from the slides, which was a bit annoying because he never actually covered the slide material in class. Once you realize this, the class becomes a lot more bearable. Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class, but I believe this class had pretty heavy work load. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very insightful, especially if you want to go into finance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid econ elective that will teach them some good, applicable stuff about corporations. Prof Pascutti is one of the class's great strengths. His personality and anecdotes add a lot to the class. Textbook is very good, you should actually read it if you have any unclarity about the course material (and the problem sets map closely to the textbook). Overall, less theory-based than Financial Theory (as the name would imply), but this class covers more and with greater applications. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if you want to go into finance. ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you are interested in learning the basics of Corporate finance!! ",
            "\u00a0if the TA's hadn't gone over how to do the psets in each section, I would have been SO lost ",
            "\u00a0The class was really challenging, but I learned a lot and Pascutti and the TAs are really there to help you succeed. If the subject is interesting I would recommend taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The lack of clarity of the class fortunately doesnt compromise the importance of its material. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it's a very \"life skills\" type of class in regards to learning about the stock market ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you want to work in finance. It definitely teaches you a lot, but it is a lot more work than most other econ classes. So just don't take it with a high workload. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to do anything in business, I recommend taking a finance course just to understand all the financial aspects you'll deal with, as those will be important and ubiquitous. This course can really be good, but the grading can be harsh or fair depending on the rest of the course. For someone who has no financial background before this course, it can prove dauntingly challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's definitely a lot of work, so be prepared to put in a lot of effort to do well. But it pays off, and I personally thought the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, the information is really useful to know, esp. for anyone interested in a career in finance. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Pascutti is an engaging lecturer, syllabus includes a lot of applicable concepts ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the topics in Finance, such as annuities/perpetuities, bonds, corporate governance, equities, and options. Professor Pascutti is a great lecturer and the course should be shopped, if not taken, just to see him in action! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you're interested in finance. Even if you just follow the news, this is a great class that will give you a better understanding about the world of finance/corporations. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELy but if you're looking for an easy A, this is not the class for you. This is the most useful class I have taken at Yale.  As someone who accepted a full-time offer into capital markets, I truly wish I had taken this course before my summer internships in finance. I walked away with a tremendous amount of knowledge, feeling a lot more confident with the jargon, terminology, and general financial concepts. Although many people recommend taking it CR/D, I ended up taking the class for a grade because it incentivized me to put in more work and make sure I put in my best effort. As a senior taking the class with a full-time offer, it was easier for me not to get frustrated by the lack of structure and sometimes confusing/incoherent lecture style of Professor Pascutti. If you want to learn about finance, please do yourself a favor and take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Its a solid finance course, BUT it is seriously outdated. All the problem sets require pointless and extremely long calculations by hand. The material is mostly too theoretical. The exams are hard and super long. If you can't do calculations very quickly -- you will run out of time. Nevertheless, content-wise they were fair and Prof. Pascutti provided all the material necessary to prepare. I wish this class would be more like the SOM one with case studies and Excel-based problem sets. As it is now, the skills you learn in the class are too conceptual to be translatable into the real world. On the bright side, however, Prof. Pascutti is a brilliant lecturer. He covers material very well and provides lots of interesting real-life references. He used to run a hedge-fund -- so he is one of the best sources of knowledge at Yale fr you, if you want to go into finance. The course is organized pretty well. The sections and office hours are very helpful. So, I am torn. If you love finance -- take it. But also take one of the SOM courses afterwards. "
