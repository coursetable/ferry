            "\u00a0I think, similar to traditional climate policy conversations, there was much more attention paid to greenhouse gas mitigation and not very much to adaptation. I think that's a critical gap, and that students need to be learning about adaptation policies in parity with mitigation ones. Additionally, it would be helpful to cover policy mechanisms that are not market based. There is, of course, a reason to learn market-based mechanisms when it comes to climate policy, but I think it's a big omission to not mention how a non-market-based mechanism would operate. ",
            "\u00a0It would be better if we can receive some presentation material to digest lecture of Prof. Dan Esty ",
            "\u00a0The course itself was great.  It would be beneficial, however, if more instruction was given on the class writing assignments and if the grading was done faster so that improvements can be for the next assignment.  The option was given to do an extra policy memo to drop the lowest grade, but it was difficult to make that decision when grades had not been returned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good breadth of topics for a survey type course. Readings were varied and provided good insight.\r\nWeaknesses: Energy and mitigation were given much more weight/emphasis than other subjects such as adaptation, forestry, land use, agriculture, equity, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Dan's depth of knowledge and insight on the topic. Weaknesses are the lack of student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Feedback on memos could be done on a more timely basis to allow ample time to incorporate criticisms into subsequent memo assignments.\r\n\r\nAppreciate Professor Esty's encouragement of class participation/Socratic method but more difficult to do with such a large class of 50+ students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: depth of knowledge presented, clarity of information presented, very engaging class sessions, interesting assignments\r\nWeaknesses: my main criticism is the amount of energy policy presented in this course. I would have preferred more time spent on international policy, and a little less on energy. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Esty's lectures were very engaging. Weakness: slow response/feedback on policy memos from TA team. ",
            "\u00a0The course is too broad to provide anything meaningful to students. All of these topics seem to be covered in other courses, and the course even begins to repeat information over the semester. Taking a deeper dive into any handful of topics would be much better. The policy memos treated topics too large to be realistic or useful. The class size is too big to facilitate discussion, and the lectures were didactic. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Esty is a great orator. Materials covered in the lectures were highly illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe reading list was expertly curated. I learned a great deal from the readings alone! Dan Esty is very knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere was often little discussion of the readings in class. I would have liked to see more integration of the readings with class discussion. I think many people skipped the readings as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthens include Dan's insight and experience, very engaging lectures, policy memo assignments (difficult, but extremely useful skill to develop), and the readings, which complemented in-class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings on adaptation, in particular, are quite outdated. Most of the adaptation community is advocating for a move away from framing the conversation as mitigation OR adaptation, but rather mitigation AND adaptation given that impacts are already happening and that some may be unavoidable. I also would have appreciated a broader international focus, and I think that the developed/developing country isn't useful. China's circumstances, for example, are vastly different from Uganda's. It would've been really interesting to have a lecture focused on LDCs and SIDS as well as a bit more nuance in how we categorize development around the world. ",
            "\u00a0It was occasionally hard to follow Dan because he doesn't use slides. Actually, that made it very hard for me. It would be great if he could use any sort of visual representation to highlight the most important take aways. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings of this class are very interesting and very helpful for me to understand the course materials. I hope the lecture can be more interactive between Professor Esty and students. ",
            "\u00a0Daniel Esty is an amazing lecturer and the class and content is very engaging and interesting. The weaknesses are a sense of a lack of guidance with assignments, and Dan seems very unavailable. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - practical, big picture, useful assignments.\r\nweaknesses - I wish we went a bit more into the nitty gritty of climate policies in a more systematic way ",
            "\u00a0The content is always interesting and the policy memos really force you to think critically about policy issues. That being said, lectures often got repetitive and the class sometimes felt like Esty's cult of personality. Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy but sometimes half a lecture would be rehashing the exact same points from the previous week. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course would have been more rewarding in a seminar format (smaller class size, with more emphasis on discussion). However, in its current format I learned a lot from Prof. Esty's lectures. I also thought that the policy memo assignments were a good exercise and helped me learn more about  the course content. However, I felt that the assigned reading loads per class were unreasonably high, and I doubt that any of the students were doing all of the assigned reading. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course are the very detailed lectures. I learned a lot of valuable information from them. A weakness of the course is that the professor did not grade the policy memos. I would have liked him to grade them since he knows first-hand how a policymaker thinks. "
