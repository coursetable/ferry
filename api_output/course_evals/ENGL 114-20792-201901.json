            "\u00a0This course helped me in completely rebuilding the way I write. I believe this course was integral in my learning as a first-year, as it tore down all of the ways that I knew how to write and restructured them to be stronger. I learned how to draft essays with more purpose, as well as extremely important editing skills. I learned how to close-read and how to better develop my thoughts on a piece from the get-go. Without this course, I wouldn't be able to write at the same level as my peers. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skills I learned from this course was to think about my readers' perspectives, who my targeted audience is, signposting my paragraphs so the argument doesn't surprise the reader, how to read closely to future papers, and how to research (from a beginning idea, to finding sources through Yale's library resources, to citing).

            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more discussion and practice of writing, but found class discussions in general very engaging and helpful in the writing process. I loved that I was almost always working on an essay throughout the duration of the course, but not at an overwhelming pace. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include how well thought out in class activities are. From taking a few minutes to write out our thoughts instead of just reflect on our ideas to the short example readings we often did to point out important structural elements of essays such as transitions, every part of the course was very detailed and intentional.  I believe that the only way the course could have improved was better communication in assignments that are online, such as discussions. Towards the end of the course though, communication greatly increased! ",
            "\u00a0The most helpful element is the in-class readings and discussions of how the authors of the readings formulate their arguments, how they structure exactly what they want to say, and how they do so effectively. Also analyzing what parts of certain readings were not as effective was helpful to realize what a reader likes in an argument. Thinking about the reader's perspective was then an important lesson from these in-class discussions. In terms of learning how to edit and improve an essay, I really appreciated the one on one discussions with Professor Baynes-Ross. They were very useful to help me organize my thoughts into arguments, to clarify certain parts of the paper that were ambiguous, and to even restructure certain parts so the writing flowed better.  I honestly cannot think of anything that can be added to make the course more valuable to improve my skills as a writer. However, during some of the classes, we split the readings among half the students. I imagine that it was a way for the class to be able to discuss more readings as possible during the class period, but I felt lost whenever the other group would talk about their passage because I didn't get a chance to read it. I wish we did less of these activities, or the same amount but given time to read all passages. "

            "\u00a0I definitely would! Though this class is hard, it definitely has made me a better fighter! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I definitely was challenged and grew as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think any ENGL 114 is important to take for first years especially. This ENGL 114 also happened to include stimulating conversation that is extremely pertinent to problems we face today. Coupled with the small class size, this class created the perfect environment to improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As an ENGL 114 course, it teaches you how to significantly improve your writing. This particular section exceeded my expectations for an English class. The topic itself was very intriguing and the course readings were very well selected to give you a sense about rebellion. The readings drew from multiple perspectives ranging from colonialism and rebellion back then to more recent times such as discussions on decolonization, nationalism, race, and gender. This section was very encompassing of different aspects of rebellion that I had not even thought about when first deciding to take the course, so it surprised me in a good way. "
