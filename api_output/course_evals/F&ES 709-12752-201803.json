            "\u00a0The course provided basic understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological components of soil. Particularly this course was helpful in explaining the current research within the field, as well as practical knowledge on soil sampling and management. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about AM and EMF systems. However, the material was too technical for me, and I was not able to comprehend a lot of information most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting course in that i developed a way of understanding the dynamics between soils and the natural world. There is so much that we don't understand about soils in managing them, or managing for them when thinking about forest management. I learned where to retrieve information on soils, how to interpret the information, and what these properties of soils mean for what can grow in them. The biological world of soils is so vast that it needs its own class. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of soil science ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic and necessary overview of soil science in a very engaging atmosphere. The larger ecological dynamic that plays out between above and belowground systems was fascinating and inspired a great deal of thought on my part about how we look at plant communities, nutrient cycling, and the lack of soil biota variables in many models. ",
            "\u00a0I think the best skill I learned in this class is being critical of declared absolutes, as soil science is constantly changing as new information arises. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in the soil, how these processes interact with one another, and how they influence soil health and function. We also explored the ways in which soil influences and is influenced by aboveground ecosystem components. Much of our current understanding of soil is still under debate in academic journals. Unresolved questions may have a big impact on climate models and how we manage soils for resilience and carbon sequestration. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to assess the current body of knowledge related to soil science and how to execute a client project. ",

            "\u00a0nearly none ",
            "\u00a0Fundamental understanding of soil. I have an awareness of some of the main problems/theories facing soil science over in recent decades and presently. ",
            "\u00a0Mainly the chemistry aspect of soils ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broad working knowledge of the field of soil science from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Not exactly sure, to be honest ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction (for me) to soil science. I appreciated the many different angles that Mark took, and especially liked how he organized the class into three units with lecture topics within each one. \r\n\r\nThe biggest insight for me was the multi-dimensionality of soils, and how someone with management objectives has to think in all these dimensions all at once. I also learned about useful proxies for measuring soils, the problems and caveats with those proxies, and what information is actually important and practical for land managers.\r\n\r\nI also developed some hands-on skills with soil sampling and testing, thanks to the group project assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to many foundational and cutting edge concepts in soil science that I was unfamiliar with before. I feel this course has given me a vocabulary with which I can talk to other professionals about soil health and management but not a full competency in being able to apply that knowledge. I would be able to talk with a farmer or land manager about their soil conditions but not be able to make a strong recommendation or analyze their soils. \r\n\r\nI feel the bigger advantage to this course was that it did an excellent job demonstrating the importance of soils in a larger environmental context. The specific advantage Dr. Bradford brought to the course was highlighting the complexities in modeling soil dynamics, what the limitation of our science currently are, and outlining the current tension points in the academic field of soil science. He did this better than maybe any of my other instructors. I think it is a very hard thing to cover the massive scope of this course and there were definitely frustration with that, but he rapidly showed us the landscape of the field and brought our attention to the most consequential areas of exploration. Few people probably have an understanding of the field and its relation to global environmental issues like Mark does and I found his lectures to include many candid insights that will help me understand whatever academic fields my own pursuits take me in a better light. ",

            "\u00a0I was hoping that the class would be more general knowledge about soils. The material covered was too specific for me. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to relate the information learned to make management decisions, sometimes understanding the management implications was blurry, but overall good. ",

            "\u00a0I was hoping to come away from this course with more concrete takeaways for management, but I learned that is not very realistic. There are still too many unknowns in the field of soil science. I enjoyed our class discussions and debates regarding this uncertainty; they were very thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0I was hoping for a bit more of a basic introduction into soil science. I think that sometimes the focus on management applications overshadowed the basic knowledge, and it might have been better to separate them more. ",

            "\u00a0My expectations were surpassed on the \"big-picture\" front and I struggled to find the time to absorb everything on the soils management front. I would have liked more time to process the material and develop a better understanding of it as we were reviewing concepts. This class felt like a sprint which had its benefits in what we were able to cover overall but made it difficult to give it the time needed for an introduction to soil science. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The course was well structured, with each day covering an important theme in a linear manner. The necessary background on the physical and chemical components of soil were provided clearly, and the extension into the biological component was interesting and particularly relevant. The course was also well adjusted to meet the needs of the students. I would have liked to learn some lab techniques and think the class would benefit from a lab component. ",
            "\u00a0The information given could be distilled a lot more, especially for students who do not have a strong chemistry or biology background. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe add case studies to the class, in lieu of paper critiques, where poor management decisions led to objective failures. Or maybe a few professional guests to talk about their work in soils, the implications of managing them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of ground covered, I learned a lot\r\n\r\nWeakness: Bradford speaks very quickly!! ",
            "\u00a0One weakness inherent in the schedule was the length of the lecture periods; with such a large group in a smallish room for such a long time, we would often monitor the CO2 levels as the afternoon went on and people nodded off. I do not think this reflects on the quality of lecture- more the setting of the classroom and the condensation of the week into a single day. \r\nOne of the main strengths was the obvious depth of knowledge brought to the class by both Mark and Dane Kane the TA. Both instructors had a clear passion for the subject that was evident in discussions and the field trip we took locally. Another strength was the challenging questions posed to the students during class discussions. Mark always made you feel like your response was valued. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be organized differently to make more sense. Some lectures that were given almost at the end of the semester (i.e. Module 3) could have actually helped set a baseline and helped to better understand some other more complex subjects given at the very beginning. The class textbook should be mandatory and reading it should be more emphasized, as opposed to simply recommending it. I highly appreciated applying our learning to real-life scenarios and actually giving recommendations to clients through our final project. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the order in which the content was taught (definitions - taxonomy - physical & chemical processes - biology - management). The individual and group assignments helped me understand the material and its applications for management. I also appreciated the opportunity to work with an external client. I'm glad I was able to take this course my second year of school as I think I would have been lost if I could only take it my first semester. A few changes to the structure of this course would facilitate student learning: 1) identify prerequisites for this course, perhaps Physical Sciences and Ecosystems & Landscapes, 2) offer it every year so that the class size is smaller and students can take it after meeting the prerequisites, 2) switch to a twice a week format - 3 hours is too intense for a lecture-based course, 3) add a lab component that focuses on measuring and analyzing soil properties, and 4) provide more structure for the group projects. ",
            "\u00a0Mark and Dan worked very well together to provide a holistic overview of soil science. Mark typically provided the more theoretical and academic perspective, while Dan was very effective at showing how those concepts applied on the ground level. Both instructors were also very generous with their time and open to working with students to help them learn the material. The client project was another phenomenal learning opportunity. Having an applied project for a real-world client prepared us for our work beyond FES in a way that a 3 hour written exam would not. I learned so much about non-profit project management, data analysis, and land management in the process.\r\n\r\nI think it would be effective for the course to be structured as two 90 minute lectures per week rather than one 3 hour lecture. By the end of the 3 hours, it felt like we were all oversaturated and no longer absorbing the information, especially on the back to back lecture days. Additionally, I came to FES with a background in physical sciences, which I think helped me enormously in this class. However, I heard from many of my peers, especially those who did not receive the same level of scientific training, that it could be hard to keep up. It might be better to offer this course as a secondary one in a series, with some sort of foundational course before it. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is that several basic properties were repeated in various contexts, which helped in understanding them better. Sometimes the lectures were a bit hard to follow. I also wish that we'd had a final exam (which would have incentivized studying the material more) rather than a group project (which was not defined very well and not very organized). ",
            "\u00a0strengths: both the professor and TA were very friendly and welcoming.\r\nweaknesses: this was a very nuanced view of soil science that skimmed too quickly over any other soil-related topics that weren't specifically in the wheelhouse of the professor ",
            "\u00a0The class was  a bit lofty for non-soil science students. ",
            "\u00a0Both Mark and Dan are enthusiastic instructors and I appreciate that. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that Mark is passionate and knowledgeable about soil science. The individual and client projects are also a strength of this course because they help us to apply the information we are learning to real-world scenarios. \r\n\r\nI felt that a weakness of the course was a lack of information synthesis outside of the projects. Soil science is a vast and complicated field, and I was overwhelmed by the amount of material that we covered and confused as to what were important takeaways. Perhaps having exams or quizzes would have forced both Mark and us students to synthesize the information, boiling down what was important and reviewing it. Instead we covered a lot of topics that were then never mentioned or reviewed again. It was also challenging to apply the information we learned to actual management situations. While the individual and client projects helped with this, it would have been nice to see more of that in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I guess it's good that it's taught in a way that throws into question some previous understandings of soil science.  However this just made the course more confusing and really didn't give me anything solid to take away from a management perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really long and is in a terrible room. My suggestion for improvement is to break the class into two meetings, and move to a different room that has better circulation. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm whining, but I always left class meetings with a headache and feeling very spacey due to poor air circulation and high concentrations of CO2. I felt it really interfered with my ability to focus during class.\r\n\r\nA strength of the class is the back and forth Dan and Mark have with each other. Dan is not afraid to speak up if he thinks a point could use more clarification, and Mark is gracious in allowing Dan to contribute to the lecture--or sometimes even correct him. I also really appreciate how Mark will admit he does not know the answer to some questions. In fact, Mark is very open with the pressures on the discipline now as international agreements depend more and more on soils for sequestration--and how the scientific community just doesn't know some things, and doesn't know how to answer some questions. This all-around humility helped me feel empowered to ask questions that I may have been embarrassed to ask otherwise.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes Mark asked questions that were so obvious that I worried I was missing something. For example, a question might be \"What else besides water and soil particles makes up soil?\" The answer is air, but that answer is so obvious that it almost seemed like I was missing a crucial piece of information, if that makes sense. Frequently no one would answer these kinds of questions when he asked them. \r\n\r\nI would also suggest a greater amount of structure in the paper discussion classes. We would have a freeform discussion that did not always enhance my understanding of the paper, and I would have appreciated some framing questions or statements from Mark, or even another student. ",
            "\u00a0Mark talks extremely fast and there is a lot of soils-specific language that can be confusing. It took my full attention to keep up with his lectures and if I missed something he was saying or didn't understand it I could not stop to go back in my notes or I would be further lost. This can work well in short spurts but the lecture is very long and rapid for the whole time. He made a good effort to pause for questions as time but at some points I felt too lost to pull the whole class back for my questions. I think iclickers might be a good implementation for him to gauge where the whole class is and on what concepts they have fallen behind on. It would be great to have brief refreshers at the beginning of new sections regarding what concepts we are going to carry through and more conclusion slides would help synthesize the important content. ",
            "\u00a0The 3 hour time slot was a lot of lecture time after the first couple weeks when we no longer had field trips. I think the course could have benefited from meeting twice a week for less time instead, or from maintaining field trips throughout the semester, perhaps in the form of occasional lab work. I really liked when Dr. Bradford lectured via the whiteboard since I think it sort of slowed his thoughts down a bit and engaged the students more. I appreciated hearing about the nuance and debates in the soil science field, though it wasn't always clear what the major takeaways from some of Dr. Bradford's more off-the-cuff digressions ought to have been. Having Dan in the room to rephrase or add insights was helpful in these moments. Since Dr. Bradford speaks so quickly and does go on occasional, hard-to-follow tangents (and since the lectures were 3 hours), it could have been helpful to record lectures for second viewing on Canvas. I didn't mind the weekly assignments, but I think some old school problem sets or worksheets (as homework or done in class) could have helped to make sure we were all grasping the key points and foundational science. ",
            "\u00a0course is quite unorganised, so it is hard to engaged for three hours; it is hard to grasp onto the content and identify what is to be taken away; the group project with the client was a great aspect, it involved a lot of independent learning ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were hard to follow at times, especially in areas referencing science (e.g., chemistry) that I was hazy on. It was also challenging during certain lectures that explored subjects over which there has been conflict in the scientific community: it wasn't always clear whether Mark was discussing the debunked idea, the new idea, or the idea we really needed to know. In general, I would have found it helpful to be more clear in lectures about which concepts were the core material we really needed to know, and which ones were exciting fields of study. Also, on a more concrete level, I would suggest that the course be broken up into two days per week of 90 minutes, rather than one three-hour block. A different room that has actual ventilation would be better, and video recording the lectures to put on Canvas would also be really helpful. "
