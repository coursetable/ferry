            "\u00a0This class was formative, educational, and engaging for me. I learned how to engage with complex texts and form ideas that I felt confident sharing in class. I have become a much better reader, discusser, and thinker through this course, and I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Unlike a lot of students who step foot on Yale's campus, I don't think I came into college with sharp critical thinking skills. This class takes what you have and sharpens it to a fine point. At the end of the seminar, you won't be able to see the world and our notions of the \"real\", \"nature\", or \"authentic\" the same way. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper appreciation for philosophy and a better understanding of the history of authenticity. Most importantly, though, I learned how to think critically and to question any information given to me. This class has changed the way I view a lot of things in society and made me reflect a lot on my identity. ",
            "\u00a0I was encouraged to engage and question and stretch my mind beyond my comfort zone from day 1. I really learned how to read and understand philosophical texts for every class, and take that a step further in analyzing them on occasion for our papers. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to express one's thoughts through writing ",
            "\u00a0How to approach/trace a question through different fields/lens. To be more nuanced in my thinking and less reactive. ",
            "\u00a0A critical outlook on the nature of authenticity. The ability to analyze complex texts and discuss them at a high level, moving towards deeper understanding. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and have deep discussions about complex philosophical pieces and write about them in a way that furthers my understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read really complicated, dense texts and synthesize, discuss, and connect them. ",
            "\u00a0Strong emphasis on analytical thinking ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read philosophical, sociological, and other types of academic essays; I learned to dissect and discuss something I didn't fully understand; I learned about patterns and areas of thought that I didn't know existed. We were introduced to the full, very, very complicated arena of what it means to be \"real\" and authentic. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is perfect for students coming from diverse backgrounds who want to have deep, meaningful conversations and learn to navigate difficult conversations. This class challenges the ways you think and provides a unique opportunity to grow as a student and as a person. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are Professor Khawaja and the very intriguing class materials. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the semester was a deep dive into very theoretical and complex philosophical texts, which was very intimidating for me. I wish there was some way to immerse me into the theory behind authenticity without completing overwhelming me the first two months of school. Although it was a struggle for me, however, I soon got over the learning curve and engaged more with the class. I really appreciated the online canvas discussions because it forced me to synthesize and identify ideas that I was particularly confused by or interested in. It also gave me a chance to practice my writing. I also really enjoyed reading the rest of classmates' responses because they were all so different, yet interesting. I wish, however, this class had a little more writing. I truly learned the most while writing my papers, and while difficult, it was extremely fulfilling and enjoyable. If we were assigned more papers that were worth less, that would decrease the overall anxiety the class had about each paper and allow us to improve and work on problems we had from our previous paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Khawaja is an insane academic. She will not only put the texts you read into fantastic clarity and context, but she will also ask you the right questions to get to the heart of your point. You can feel that she cares about what she's teaching, and it leads to engagement on all parts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, it felt like we spent too long on one text and too little time on others. I would also have benefitted from writing exercises beginning earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0More self-reflection and personal involvement in writing assignments ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely strong. The readings are generally fascinating and the discussions even more interesting. Professor Khawaja is an amazing instructor and going to office hours enriches the course a lot as well. The improvement could have been more writing assignments for I felt that was often when I discovered or more deeply understood the ideas we were discussing. ",
            "\u00a0Having the class more spaced out instead of on Mondays and Wednesdays would help greatly especially with longer texts. More essays and more opportunities for feedback (maybe having rough drafts?).\r\n\r\nOverall though, an incredibly engaging course that covered a wide array of texts in an efficient and worthwhile manner. ",
            "\u00a0The class moved along at a good pace, specifically in the way that we spent one class per reading. \r\nMost of the readings for this course were very long and dense, so it learning how to read them efficiently was one of the most challenging aspects of the class. I wished it was addressed earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the syllabus of this course and how discussion-based it waswe, the students, and our thoughts about the text were allowed to really govern the class. However, I sometimes wished to hear not only my classmates thoughts but also my professors, and found myself wishing that either one class a week or a part of a class each week had a lecture component. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses\r\n\r\nThe content and the instruction were very substantive and amazing overall! ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely in the texts - I took this class because the essays and novels we were reading seemed to be an interesting and comprehensive foundation, and they were. I never would have read or heard of the essays we read otherwise, and I am glad to have read them. Classtime was vital, especially since the texts were very complicated and often nearly impossible to understand without the help of our instructor. Class was often interesting (though it takes extreme focus to follow the complicated trains of thought), but the students could have benefited from receiving more regular feedback. While comments on our essays were helpful, in between the three essays we had during the duration of the semester, for students who are more shy it could be helpful to more regularly receive feedback from the instructor. It would even be helpful if we could be assigned a \"reading pair\" that we were supposed to regularly write to to digest and discuss the reading for the next day. Such a collaborative structure could help students feel less alone in the struggle! "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Authenticity is a fantastic, life-changing course and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to engage deeply and learn on multiple levels. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolute recommend this course to anyone who has the opportunity to take it. I didn't get the grade I wanted, but I don't have any regret. Really, this opens a whole new world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to push yourself to think critically about the way society works and are curious about philosophy. This class samples a wide range of texts from Frankenstein to Sartre which is allows you to discover what you enjoy or don't enjoy. However, be ready to spend a lot of time over the reading. Classes are mentally very intensive, and you get what you put into the class. This class is definitely not for everyone, but if you are up to challenge the way you think I highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is a fantastic first-year seminar, and the only one that caught my eye. I'm glad that I was placed into it, and would recommend both STEM-, Humanities-, and Social Sciences-leaning students to take it. It tackles a versatile subject matter that would benefit all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this course was incredibly helpful in understanding myself and what I am interested in, as well as the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It will undoubtedly be one of the best courses I take at yale. I know Im only a first year but the critical thinking and depth of thinking this course stimulates is unique. And Professor Khamaja is a dedicated, insightful, relatable instructor that has though fully curated the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course, even as a STEM major, is incredible in that it changes one's outlook on themselves and the institutions around them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if the student was very interested with philosophy and didn't mind a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if a student wants to read and discuss a great deal of philosophical texts about identity from a bunch of different angles and learn how to present and talk about those ideas, then I would recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0Possibly the best course I will have taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student. Even though I was confused a lot of the time, and still struggle to explain this class to others who ask about it, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to read the texts we did, listen to the fascinating ideas of our professor and peers, and grapple with complicated ideas. The class is certainly a rigorous academic experience! And some of my classmates have really, really loved this class. But if the student felt that they wouldn't have time to do the 50 pages of reading before each class, or felt unmotivated to stretch their minds and understanding, then they may not get as much out of the class. But a student shouldn't be too afraid - we all come into the class knowing very little! "
