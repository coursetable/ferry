            "\u00a0THe basics of digital photography, photoshop, bridge, and editing. ALso how to evaluate other pictures and talk about photography ",
            "\u00a0I didnt have any exposure or knowledge of photography (at least no more than the basic Instagram user who posts photos of dogs or the brunch they had at that cute diner), but this class taught us the basics of digital photography techniques (aperture, profiles, shutter, etc) and photoshop. We also took the time to look at a variety of different works from famous photographers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to use technical skills regarding photography including Adobe Photoshop, Bridge and also how to work basic features of a DSLR. Insights gained included how photography is perceived and what differentiates interesting from regular work. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my artistic ability. I think the work I started to create became more meaningful and therefore more interesting, not just for me but people around me. I also am extremely thankful for the photoshop and printing skills that I learned. I think this class has pointed me in a good direction and I learned more about what it means to make art. It made me work to create photos more and try to make something more than just a picture. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me basic skills in Photoshop, and equipped me with a language for discussing photography as an art. In addition, I learned the fundamental principles for using a DSLR Camera. ",
            "\u00a0While I did learn some technical skills (mainly Photoshop), I would say that this class taught me more about learning how to look at photos and really think about photography as an art and photography as craft. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to use a DSLR camera and Photoshop, and also learned a lot about what I want to express as a visual artist. ",
            "\u00a0* how to use a DSLR camera\r\n* how to edit photos using Photoshop, and Photoshop Raw\r\n* feedback on compositions of your photos ",
            "\u00a0I learned many technical skills - how to use a digital camera, work with aperture, shutter speed, light, etc, an advanced skillset in photoshop, print and change presentation of photos. Also a more holistically - a new perspective on what \"photography is\" and exposure to the works of different famous photographers. ",
            "\u00a0On the more technical side, I learned how to use a DSLR camera as well as how to edit and print my own photos on Photoshop (ie. The basic skills you need to be a competent photographer).  But I also learned about what constitutes a good photo and what it means to make a good photo. "

            "\u00a0strengths: learned a lot from classmates and staff and got me really excited about photography\r\nweaknesses: was pretty disorganized at times ",
            "\u00a0I think having more in-class ventures outside to shoot photos would be awesome, and having more artistic feedback throughout the semester would really get us thinking about photography as an art form. ",
            "\u00a0The way the course is structured allows for full creativity in the work that students choose to pursue and present.\r\nNo particular weaknesses that come to mind. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is very helpful for just forcing someone to make images. I also liked learning to print and make basic edits on photoshop. I wish a little more feedback could have been gained, maybe individually.\r\nI do wish that the critiques had been slightly more spread out (especially the second to last one and the final). I also wish that More time had been used in class to make images, but I do understand that it is important for people to have an opportunity to use photoshop in class. ",
            "\u00a0This section of the course, in particular, doesn't have a lot of structure, which I think is really good for starting photographers. I would say that there's a bit of an emphasis on producing a lot of photos (our weekly assignment was ~100 photos of anything) with maybe the idea that just going out there to take lots of photos is a good learning experience in and of itself. However, I did feel that having a LITTLE bit of structure (maybe weekly themes for our assignments, etc.) could also be useful for starting photographers. A lot of times I feel like I was taking lots of photos for no reason other than I found them vaguely interesting, but I think it made the process of developing a discerning eye a lot more slower. I also didn't feel like I really received a lot of feedback on my weekly assignments; most of the feedback I received was from the crits, which I didn't feel was enough. ",
            "\u00a0Crits were sometimes a bit weird since some students were really interested in photography as art and some were more interested in photography as a way to document their lives/friends -- it could be hard to critique sometimes since everyone's goals felt different. I wonder if there should be two classes, each with a slightly different focus. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a very fun class. Individual projects and weekly photo assignments were very loose (you could choose what you wanted to photograph), and feedback is given while working in the computer lab or during critiques. Professor Partin is very engaged and passionate about photography, and he will expose you to various photographers and collections of photos through class visits to the Haas Library and the YUAG, bringing photo books to class for students to look through, and giving suggestions when chatting individually. The only weakness of this course is that it doesn't necessarily teach or expose you to different subject matters or ways to form a photographic composition because students are given the option to photograph whatever they choose. ",
            "\u00a0Truly loved this class - would not change anything! ",
            "\u00a0Two major strengths of this course were our fantastic professor, Ted, and our equally fantastic TA, Angel.  They encouraged us to pursue our own individual styles while also pushing us to become better and more competent photographers.  Additionally, they were always very welcoming to any questions we may have had and offered great constructive criticism.  Another strength was the varying levels of experience everyone had in photography.  Some of us were absolute beginners while others had been photographing for years. I initially thought that having advanced photographers with beginners in the same class was not a great idea.  And while it was at times discouraging, this setup only helped to create a class with different and fresh perspectives which ultimately inspired everyone in their own work.  The greatest weakness of this course was the initial cost of buying a DSLR camera, lens, memory card, paper, hard drive, etc. at the beginning of the semester (definitely buy used if you can, or borrow from a friend to save some money.)  But if you are serious about learning about photography, you will buy a camera eventually so why not do it for this class?  Besides, Ted was very understanding and gave us the first two weeks of class to gather up all the materials. "

            "\u00a0Yes! good intro class to photography ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was by far one of the most engaging and unique courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, as it helps one build their photographic eye. Even if someone isn't super interested in photography, it is fun to learn how to create images, use photoshop, and make prints. It helps teach the basics of taking photos which I think anyone would enjoy. I didn't really have many negatives; if you enjoy photography, the class is as fun as you make it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student who is new to photography and wants to learn both about famous photographers and how to shoot with a DSLR Camera. I only had experience with my cell phone and a point-and-shoot camera, but after taking this class, I am able to clearly articulate technical decisions made by photographers in their work. Also, it is now difficult for me to go back to shooting images with my phone, because there is so much more to crafting an image than capturing the immediacy of an event with a camera that does not allow one the capture the intricacies of moments. Also, Professor Partin is incredibly knowledgeable about famous photographers, so his classes are sure to be filled with rich presentations of other renowned photographers! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is a lot of work and a lot of the work is very self-motivated, so you only get out of it as much as you put in, but it is very rewarding. I feel like most of the things I learned are very subtle and sometimes hard to articulate, but this class gave me a new perspective. I feel like I learned more than just how to make photos that looked good but really think about photography as a way to express myself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you want a solid introduction to digital photography. I took it with Ted Partin and he was great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! It's a fun course that will hopefully show you a different perspective on seeing the world around you. Professor Partin is such an icon ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this! You will gain a new perspective on the world around you and basic photography skills that will last a lifetime. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend it.  If you are even the slightest bit interested in looking at or making photos, please take this course! The biggest obstacle by far is the initial cost of buying a DSLR camera, lens, memory card, paper, hard drive, etc. at the beginning of the semester (definitely buy used if you can, or borrow from a friend to save some money.)  But Ted was very understanding and gave us the first two weeks of class to gather up all the materials.  After that, he took us through the basics of how a camera works, showed us professional level photographs, and taught us what we needed to know about using Photoshop and printing our photos. But essentially, you go out and take photos of whatever it is that you want, bring your memory card to class to edit/print them, and then you present your work to the class in critiques (3 critiques of 10-15 photos a semester) where you will be provided with constructive criticism.   All in all, Intro to Photography is a low-key course that provides you with the basic knowledge, tools, and support to introduce you to photography and to make you into a better photographer!  It was also really great seeing everyones unique style develop over the semester.  And while it is low-key, you will find yourself dedicating lots of time to your photographs just because you come to care so much about your work! Again, I absolutely recommend this class and take it with Ted!  You will not regret it. "
