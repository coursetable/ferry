            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. It provided an introduction to human-animal studies with readings from people such as Derrida, Nagel, Singer, Grandin etc it straddled the fields of philosophy, psychology, sociology, biology  and literature. I really enjoyed almost every single one of the readings. This class has certainly shaped some of my fundamental beliefs and attitudes towards nonhuman animals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned various skills such as writing, communication, and critical reading. I was thoroughly engaged in the course material which pursued topics in animal consciousness, animal use in factory farming, and literary animals. ",
            "\u00a0A broad base of knowledge of the ways animals have functioned as symbols, individuals, and species over the course of Western (and sometimes international) thought, philosophy, literature, biology, and everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the breadth and some relative depth of topics relating to animal studies: a foundation in studies of animal consciousness, animal ethics, and literary theory grounded in animal studies. Learning about animals in this way yielded insights into humanity, subjectivity, and basic assumptions about life and living creatures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to connect different fields of study to one topic and to think with various lens in general. I also learned to read for class better with the intention of sharing my thoughts with a group of people and learning from them by listening and connecting their ideas with mines as well. "

            "\u00a0The readings were very interesting and I loved how interdisciplinary the course was. I also thought the workload was spot on. I was sceptical about having seminar discussions twice per week but was surprised that it worked very well, splitting up the week's reading into chunks unlike most seminars I have taken. I also loved the visits from canine friends. Writing reading responses made me engage more with the texts. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I would say the class dynamic was quite lacklustre. Perhaps this was bad luck. I also might have appreciated more guidance on some assignments - or maybe mandatory rough draft with feedback notes. I didn't gain much from the trip to the British art gallery and found the presentation irrelevant to this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a wide variety of literature to cover, and I think that the course material was very carefully selected to offer insight into each of those areas. However, I think that there could have been more material covering opinions other than those opposed to the use of animals in science, the food industry, and other areas. Many of the readings felt biased, and although this helped us form our opinions, it would have been nice to have readings to support an opposite opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I genuinely cannot think of a weakness that needs improving for this course. It was wonderful. The intellectual challenge was high  some of the theory we read was quite dense  and the class discussions we held were always lively and illuminating, leading me to consider the text in new ways. The reading responses were set up in such a way that the ones you wrote needed to really engage with the text and provide insight/opinion, but the ability to choose which weeks you did the responses allowed you to balance them with your other classes. Additionally, I loved the multidisciplinary approach; I feel like I really have feelers in most of the ways animals and animal consciousness have had an effect on human society (and us on them), and what I don't know I'll be sure to explore in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Syllabus was OUTSTANDING, Kramnick was generous, helpful, and passionate--kept a very strong and consistent discussion through the term. ",
            "\u00a0The online responses definitely made it easier to always be engaged somehow with the readings and to be an active participant in class. The syllabus was never too overwhelming either and the variety in the syllabus made the class continuously interesting and entertaining. Discussion was also usually focused on the readings! "

            "\u00a0This class was probably my favorite I have taken at Yale so far. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in human-animal relations. Reading classic philosophical texts and examining these topics through literature was really accessible and fascinating. My attitudes and beliefs have been fundamentally reshaped. The workload was perfect in my opinion. Some people in the class found audiobooks of some of the readings (audible free trials are  the best). My eyes have truly been opened to the immense injustices happening right under our noses. Most of us are so used to the world we live in today that we cannot even see the speciesism that pervades society. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to students in many areas of study. The course did a great job of balancing literary sources while also including scientific works. Additionally, this course helps fill a lack of classes on the subject of animals at Yale. Although humans constantly interact with animals on a daily basis, Yale fails to offer many classes on animals in society. This class was a perfect starting point to fit that role. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's an interesting and exciting course, and it's good for strengthening your writing and discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was a brand-new course, and I hope to see this course come into own as a fixture of Yale College curriculum because there is no syllabus like this elsewhere. The readings are diverse yet focused, Kramnick is eclectic but not distractable. I recommend this course to students from any and all academic backgrounds, especially those interesting in critical theory and posthumanities. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this to another student since the topics covered engage a range of different academic disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! It was a great intro to animal studies and it was refreshing to study animals through so many different fields and ideas. It was never too overwhelming either because the ideas always linked back to each other and we were reminded of what we have learned previously. "
