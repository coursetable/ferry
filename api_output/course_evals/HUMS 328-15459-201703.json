            "\u00a0I definitely think my ability to analyze a philosophical text and to pull out something interesting improved both in quality and speed. We read authors that I'd never read before, and I definitely think that I've gained an introductory knowledge of some of their works. I also think my writing improved at least in my ability to process and articulate philosophy, if not in style. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an introduction to the major thinkers and movements of twentieth century French philosophy, such as existentialism, post-structionalism, and vitalism. I do feel that I can now read works of the French canon and understand their arguments to a sufficient degree in themselves and in their relation to other texts. I also developed analytical and writing skills pertaining to philosophical work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the works of major French theorists/writers on temporality and related themes: including Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-ponty, Derrida, Bergsson, Deleuze, Proust, and Butler (not French but was my personal favorite, so I hope she stays on the syllabus). Prior to taking this course, I had not read any of the philosophers (or really any of their related schools - existentialism, deconstruction, post structuralism, etc.) I certainly learned a lot about theories of temporality, and the sorts of philosophic questions and methods diffrents thinkers have adopted to deal with temporality. The writing workload for this course was seriously intense - the equivalent of writing a weekly paper that (personally, but i think this was true of most the class) ranged from 4-8 pages. Professor Werner provides really helpful feedback on papers, and his comments helped to me get better at recognizing where the holes in Munich arguments were. I think my writing improved over the duration (pun intended, take the course) of the course, although this maybe could have been accomplished without quite so overwhelming a paper schedule. "

            "\u00a0Discussion for this class was excellent. I thought Professor Werner was fantastic about facilitating student discussion and that he hit a really strong balance between explaining difficult ideas and letting us explore things for ourselves. I really felt like he took us seriously, and I appreciated that. The readings were interesting and discussion rich. This class also had the best student-led discussion days, where one of us would start off with a brief presentation and guide for discussion, that I've ever experienced in a seminar. The amount and the detail in the feedback we got on writing was also excellent. \r\nI think the biggest weakness of the course was that the syllabus did not match what the course actually ended up being. This was true in terms of what we ended up reading/how time was budgeted across authors, but more importantly in the kind of workload that the class demanded. Professor Werner was great about soliciting feedback early in the course, but I didn't actually feel that the standard asked of us changed afterwards. I also don't feel that it would have been possible to do well in the course with the original guidelines from the syllabus as to the length and kind of depth of writing we were expected to produce, both on a weekly basis and for the final paper. I also think Professor Werner could have been more clear about how many of the response papers counted (myself and some of my classmates remember being told in class both that three could be dropped and that ten would count, but we only ever turned in ten). Professor Werner also provided excellent and prolific philosophical feedback on our work, but not necessarily in a way that always made it clear how to concretely improve the work for the next assignment or what would have made that particular assignment an A. I had a hard time sometimes figuring out what was worse about response papers that had done less well. ",
            "\u00a0Time and French Philosophy did an excellent job of demonstrating the multiplicity of schools of thought in French philosophy while also demonstrating the extent to which each interacts with the others. I feel that it has equipped me with the knowledge and skill set to tackle other texts within the French tradition. The amount of writing that  the course demands also greatly improves the rigor of philosophical thinking and writing. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness of this course is the disparity between its syllabus and its expectations. The workload for this course was absurd, for although the syllabus stated that weekly reading responses only had to be 500 words, the expectations of the course regarding the quality of the responses turned them into essays of about four to five pages a week. The final paper too, which the syllabus stated as 8-9 pages, also became a senior thesis-length assignment. The intellectual and psychological demands that these expectations engendered were draining and far beyond what they should have been for an undergraduate level course. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is fascinating, Professor Werner is quite helpful in getting students to a point of understanding the text enough to discuss it, while still enabling us to figure out the more subtle points of the text ourselves. \r\n\r\nSyllabus wise, I appreciated the thinkers being grouped thematically (or by method/approach), but as someone who had never read them before, and had very little knowledge on the history of philosophy, I think the course could benefit from a little more framing with respect to each thinker. I dont mean that the course should try to become like an intellectual history course - i liked that it felt like a philosophy course, although it was cross listed in humanities - but a quick gloss at the beginning of class to point out what broader developments in philosophy (or within a certain philosophic school) a thinker is responding to would be helpful. And i think interesting as well! \r\n\r\nLastly, the paper writing schedule is quite intense. I dont think it is impossible, and I was taking three writing credits (if the courses workload stays the same, this should certainly be listed as a writing credit, which it isnt not currently.  I believe I wrote over 70 pages for it, which does not include a rough draft of a term paper) and 5 classes AND struggle to pace myself well while writing, so my opinion here should be taken with that in Mind. I like the idea of weekly reading responses to encourage engagement,  but they amounted to weekly papers (if not always very good ones). I think modifying the course so that a student has to produce 5 reading responses total (and can submit more if theyd like) would help make this more manageable. To keep a level of engagement up, students could be required to post a question online before class with specific passages theyd like to discuss. "

            "\u00a0If you're a junior or senior philosophy major AND you're particularly interested in the 20th century French philosophers, I would definitely take this course. It's a rich, challenging, and deeply intellectually enriching course. I think I'm ultimately glad that I took it. \r\nThat being said, if you don't fit that above description I'm not sure I would recommend taking this course. I felt like a disproportionate amount of my time had to go into this course between reading (and re-reading) the readings to prepare for class and essentially writing a 1500ish word paper every week, it was a huge time commitment. I do genuinely feel that I got both and faster at philosophical thought and writing and that this class pushed me to produce work that I honestly would not have thought myself capable of. Discussion was excellent, the readings interesting, and Professor Werner provided pretty detailed feedback. In that vein, this class might be considered a great success. I definitely learned something and I was definitely challenged and inspired. However, the tradeoff was an amount of work that felt unreasonable at times and a certain sense of defeat in feeling that I was being asked to push my thinking literally beyond my current capacity. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an excellent introduction to 20th century French philosophy, covering many of the major thinkers and schools of thought. Professor Werner too is not only a superb seminar leader, but he also provides concise and instructive feedback on reading responses and essays. By these standards, I would recommend the course. However, I do so with great reservation. The workload for it far exceeded what it should have been for an introductory philosophy course. The reading responses, which quickly became short essays, and the final essay, which became a thesis, exacted a huge psychological toll, which prevented at times from enjoying the profundity of the texts that we were discussing. I do not think that the course took into account that none of us were graduate or even upper-level philosophy students, so that but what Professor Werner expected out of the assignments exceeded what we were capable of doing. Although I did learn a tremendous amount from the course, I can't say whether the knowledge I gained outweighs the stress it engendered. Therefore I would recommend the course only to those who are taking a very light courseload otherwise and who are deeply committed to studying 20th century thought at a higher level. For everyone else, I would caution against taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy, who knows that they can handle a very high workload. If you struggle with time management, or with writing quickly (I found it quite difficult to synthesize 40-60 pages of dense contintental theory to the extent that I could write a philosophy paper about it each week), I would caution against taking the course. Professor Werner is wonderful, understanding, and helpful with papers  but it is just a LOT of work (Id estimate 10 hours per week for the paper, and additional for the reading), and can be hard to juggle with other writing intensive classes. That being said, especially if the syllabus changes to decrease the writing pace, definitely take the course if you are interested in philosophy. I think the class emphasizes argumentative rigor in a way thats appealing as a philosophy course, but might be less so if you dont like philosophy or how philosophy classes operate. "
