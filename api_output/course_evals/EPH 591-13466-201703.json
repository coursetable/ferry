            "\u00a0Exceptional course.  The quality of the speakers was astounding and the format lent itself well to thoughtful discussions and Q&A. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nIntroducing students to global health issues\r\nHearing from professionals in the field\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDeveloping our own ideas - it seemed promising in the beginning where we would discuss with each other and share, but that stopped.\r\nSome of the lectures were very technical and the message was lost. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the course in theory, but in execution some of the topics/speakers weren't quite up to expectations. \r\nAlso, it was blatantly obvious to a lot of us that people scanned into the code and left before the lectures started. Simply don't make the code available until the end of the lecture to ensure attendance. ",
            "\u00a0Good base of knowledge regarding possibilities of work and careers in Global Health. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the majority of the speakers a lot and was impressed with the caliber of people that came to speak with us. I liked when opportunities were offered to network with the speakers. My one suggestion - do the QR code at the end, or during class. I like the QR code in general, it made attendance easy, but some people would just scan the code and then leave, which defeated the purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Personally I wished there were more speakers that focused on infectious disease. For the EMD students there was only 1 speaker over the whole semester that really focused on our interests. ",
            "\u00a0Coming from the Wall Street, I've come to the conclusion that public health people need to learn to present their materials better.  This is a serious issue that public health experts can't effectively disseminate the information or educate others.  Everyone in the field should take some basic presentation course.  Slides are not your summary notes.  They are visual effects to make your points.  Don't use small fonts.  Don't show many pieces of information at the same time.  Show one line at a time.  Public health people must learn to sell their products better! ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting speakers each week. I liked the opportunities for breakfast/dinner with the speakers ",
            "\u00a0The timing of this course was terrible--Thursday night after a long day/week, and an almost two hour period before things were due on Friday was really challenging. \r\nWhile some of the speakers were incredible, I would have gotten so much more out of it if it was framed as a dinner event, or maybe on a different night of the week. Additionally, I think more emphasis throughout the course should have been placed on the many challenges of working in global health (I've worked in global health in the past and it's not all success stories) ",
            "\u00a0It met too frequently. Being a seminar, biweekly would've been easier for students to attend and participate in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course- loved the array of speakers we had and the various research we were able to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that we were able to see various public health actors with various backgrounds.\r\nWeakness is if a particular week had a topic you weren't interested in yet you still had to go. Or some speakers were simply not interesting ",
            "\u00a0Nice overview of global health topics. I felt the seminar was general and thus not particularly geared toward any school or program. Therefore, some presentations were more engaging and interesting than others. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the invited speakers came from a very clinical point of view. The concepts were very broad and rarely went deep. Honestly quite disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Not a whole lot of engagement from the audience. However, it was nice that we got to learn about a broad array of global health topics from very knowledgeable speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I was impressed by many of the speakers and the course instructors individually, and enjoyed the structure of the course. However, I was very disappointed in the lack of self-criticism and lack and anti-colonialist lens present in the course. I have shied away from global health because, as a student with an anthropology background, I am very hesitant about pursuing an field in which western-based aid workers engage in work in the global south without a solid analysis of the power dynamics involved and the history of colonialism's impact. I was hoping to find this analysis present in Yale's global health program, and was extremely disappointed. I am considering dropping the global health concentration as a result, not because I did not enjoy this class and its speakers - I very much did - but because I don't believe I can study in a program that doesn't feel it necessary to give its intro level students a more solidly self-critical and cautious background. ",
            "\u00a0enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0Maybe shouldn't be a requirement for PH students in global health. Very elementary public health concepts discussed that seemed more helpful for med/nursing students. Limited discussion. Q/A and discussion are different. ",
            "\u00a0Could use more diverse speakers and a session on maternal child health ",
            "\u00a0Discussed many aspects of global health and appealed to the interests of students in differing fields ",
            "\u00a0This course was not a useful use of my time. I often felt like it was geared toward people who had no exposure to public health. As an MPH student I did not learn anything new. In fact, I feel as it should not be a requirement if you have any global health exposure. It was quite unenjoyable, unfortunately. ",

            "\u00a0This is the class you have to go to for global health. You hear every week from a different lecturer. Every week. There wasn't one that was skipped, so if you are planning on taking a seminar just to look good on your transcript and not go, this is not the one. However, because of the QR code being outside of the classroom, many people did just scan it and leave with no apparent repercussions. The lectures are very long and there is not very much interaction. There is also no food and it is during dinner time. ",

            "\u00a0it's a requirement so no way around it for the global health concentration but it's a fun seminar when the speaker is engaging and you are interested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0If interested in a wide range of global health topics, this course would be a good recommendation. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I answered that above - the course was interesting and informative, but missing essential subject matter I think is necessary in any good program training western individuals to work in the global south. ",
