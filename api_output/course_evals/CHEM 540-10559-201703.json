            "\u00a0Overall, it was a really helpful course for grad students, because it taught most of the basic spectroscopy theories in great mathematical detail, and yet managed to cover a large number of topics (whose basics ideally would have been covered in undergrad courses) in an organised fashion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much, and really appreciate how in depth the class went into such interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0A mathematical, and sometimes physical, understanding of quantum chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a good introduction into quantum chemistry, matrix algebra, and spectroscopy. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a strong background in quantum mechanics as it pertains to spectroscopy. The course covered a large amount of useful material over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much firmer foundation on quantum mechanics and its applications to spectroscopy than I had coming in. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Organised, covered a wide range of topics efficiently in a semester\r\nWeaknesses: The NMR portion could have been taught better ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include weekly psets that are grounded in applications of the science, the professor's familiarity with the material, and the weekly discussion section. I think it could be improved with more explicit reading material. While I appreciate the professor's notes, I think clear textbook readings would help flesh out the conceptual framework. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very well-organized and useful. I liked that all of the notes were available both in printed and digital form. I also felt that the homework assignments were useful and relevant. One suggestion for improvement would be to not include topics from the Monday lecture on the homework assignments due Tuesday. I had a busy Monday schedule, and it was difficult to find time to complete these assignments on Monday night. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe organization of this course was done very well with students knowing what to expect and the level of work appropriate for being accomplished by the given due date, especially as mid term season came around.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOverall, there is very little to criticize with this course. Some of the lecture notes could do with an extra example or a more explained one, but this was really a very good course that was taught well. "
