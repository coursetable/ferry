            "\u00a0The class is well-structured and well-taught.The professor is extremely helpful. I hope it could have met more often. ",
            "\u00a0The course simply tries to cover too much. It's hard to say what should be cut, because it's all important and interesting, but a dynamic develops where because there is simply too much work, readings get skimmed and corners get cut. It would be a more effective class if there was a (still large) but manageable workload such that students could confidently commit to completing everything with a high level of detail. \r\n\r\nThere are two solutions I see to this problem:\r\n1) Make it a two semester course. The meat of the course is realy in learning about strategy and doing cases, but in order to do this, everyone needs to be brought up to speed on an enormous amount of terminology, accounting, and legal proceedings. The course would be more effective if there was one semester of primer on the technical aspects and then a second semester focused on applying those skills to cases. Doing it all at once was exhausting and ruled out significant success for those who hadn't already worked on the buy side or in IB. \r\n\r\n2) Admit students a semester early and give out substantial reading and prep work to be done before the actual course, maybe with some self tests to avaluate preparedness. This would allow the students who already know the stuff to forego a semester of prep, but also allow students without prior experience the chanec to adequately prepare and be on even footing by the time the real class started. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are numerous. The course materials are very thorough and applicable in the real world. The case studies are challenging and engaging. Professor Schmertzler conducts the classes well and points out our mistakes promptly and constructively. \r\nI think the course can be improved by breaking it down into two courses, because the content is so enormous that there is no way we can finish it in one course. ",
            "\u00a0As much as we learned in the course, it was not structured in a way that facilitated learning, and we were not assessed in a way that reflects our understanding of the material. I felt that there was very little guidance or feedback. that being said, I learned a remarkable amount. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. Cant think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0S: strong material/textbook\r\n\r\nW: massive workload, unclear what assignments are at times ",
            "\u00a0This class is flawless. I only wish it met 7 days a week. Professor Schmertzler should consider adding the IPO speech he gave the class (the can of tomatoes assembly line) to the course textbook, because it was just that good. ",
            "\u00a0Course content (readings):\r\n\tSomeone needs to say this: the 10-point investment framework is horrible. It is too far from being mutually exclusive comprehensively exhaustible because the categories have too much overlap. Prof MS doesnt allow students to use their own frameworks (and assumes we have none of our own, which is patronizing and untrue) e.g. buckets of different weights such as transaction probability and business projections should not be at the same level, projections as a giant category on its own beats the point of a framework, unmitigated risks+returns&terms+projections overlap too much. 10 points is too many to have at the highest level of a framework. The leadership framework is also funny and includes everything one does in life under the sun; it fails to define leadership because it considers everything leadership including a person's \"methods\" (such as Excel) and again has overlap with norms, culture, structure, behaviors - it felt like just an overfitting of a bunch of sociological buzz words\r\nCourse content (seminar):\r\n\tThe class attracts a homogenous and testosterone-driven segment of Yale, which will always prevent it from being a superior Yale seminar: there was one girl in the class and few diverse students;\r\n\tFinancial modeling is quite critical to the class yet the expectations for (even) fully trained summer analysts (IB/PE) are too high - yes you are expected to know modeling but the avg max level of prep is 1 summer of work and that is not enough for the breadth of situations encountered in this class (especially historical ones); Prof MS will describe several great ideas but it is unclear if anyone knows how to model them. On one hand, Prof MS de-emphasizes the modeling and on the other, he criticizes the way students did the modeling every class and stipulates the endless list of things that need to be modeled but provides no help to meet those expectations;\r\n\tThe classes were too imbalanced  some weeks (growth equity) there was nothing to do and other weeks (PDI/Spark) there was too much;\r\nCourse assignments:\r\n\tAssignments are never checked so you never really improve; if your modeling was off, it will be off for the entire term and no one will care or notice. People will just make stuff up. For a high workload class you can get away with doing no work;\r\n\tThe grading was opaque and no one knew his/her grades until too late in the semester. Unclear whether the quizzes were being graded and when/if there would be a pre-class quiz;\r\nThe final exam's last question (40% of the grade) was too random and felt like the professor's pet project since it had little to do with material taught in class. It felt like a corporate finance fun fact/brainteaser question with no answer. The lack of public information made it rather pointless;\r\nImprovements: plan the class time and structure better (waste less time), encourage more debate and discussion as with real investments (don't espouse unchangeable truisms all the time), respect the students and cut the subtle racism (e.g. with the international Chinese student), give more feedback and provide some financial modeling advice (outside class if necessary), explain complicated corporate finance concepts more systematically ",
            "\u00a0Perfect as is but Michael could have gone quicker. We spent a couple of classes going over material from previous classes and that slowed things down sometimes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. You will learn a lot if you are willing to spend the time. I spent a fair amount of time on the class and learnt a decent amount. I now think I should have  spent more time on the class. You really learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly challenging but also an amazing learning opportunity. Veryrewarding and worth taking, but make sure that you have an easy schedule and are willing to commit. Much less worthwhile when the workload is too much to really get the most out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend this class because of the enormous learnings that this class entails. The content is so practical and useful in real world. Nonetheless, this can be a challenging class, so students must be prepared to put up a lot of efforts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It would be immensely valuable to your Yale career and a privilege to your learning as a young student, whether you enter a finance related field or not. The class will organically engage you in the material and have you collaborating with your classmates to create material you are all proud of. Professor Schmertzler is an outstanding teacher, he deeply cares about your learning and listens to your ideas. This class is the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are doing it credit/d because of the bizarre assessment structure. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course Ive Taken in economics and one of the best at Yale. It teaches you a new way of thinking: an honest, rational, humble pragmatic approach to reality. ",
            "\u00a0Great course with someone who literally pioneered the industry. Workload is massive so be sure you have enough time to dedicate to it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is life changing. ",
            "\u00a0This class = its professor. This review is by someone who did very well in the class so it is not biased. You will probably read a bunch of other overwhelmingly positive reviews; this one provides the other perspective. The class is worth taking. However, it has structural issues that the arrogant professor will never admit and the students will never point out. The fundamental problem with the other reviews is that they reflect the culture of the class: a bunch of white, male, sycophantic investment bankers who see no wrong in their Wall Street professor.\r\n\r\nInstructor:\r\n\tA problem off the bat with professor MS is: racialized remarks are not ok. At two points in class, he explicitly made fun of the international Chinese student for not having perfect English. Once, he joked that he wanted the assignment in English, not Chinese. Obviously, the spineless students laughed it off. At another time, he said he didnt expect the term sheet/contract written by the Chinese student to be good because he didnt know English. This creates a hostile environment for the student regardless of how casual everyone (white) thinks it is, and is just tragic in the modern finance world, where diversity is becoming the law of the land. There were also other moments when it was less explicit\r\n\tToo arrogant and disrespectful: Some professors are a bit pompous and it is funny to an extent. Here it is not funny. An investor should ask questions that make him/her change his/her mind and encourage discussions that lead students to the truth. Prof MS comes to class with an immutable, all-knowing, perfect answer. No one can ever really figure it out (and he prefers it that way) so he uses every class to brandish his superiority of knowledge. New ideas and debate of his perspective are quickly dismissed by him calling the students idiots, making fun of their speaking styles, making angry facial expressions etc. The class is antithetical to the intellectual Yale seminar style\r\n\tPoor time management: 90% of the classes were disastrously planned, which is astonishing for a class taught for so many years. In one class, we spent 1 hour (out of 1h 50m) on the pre-class quiz with 8 one-word answers. In one class that was probably the biggest waste of my time, he completely ignored the growth equity topic and answered questions about finance life/provided anecdotes. Anecdotes are great but too much class time is spent on them. Prof MS has separate meals almost every week so the anecdotes should be reserved for those. In general, Prof MS came with no plan or structure for class discussions and many important items remained unaddressed but we just moved to the next big topic\r\n\tA mouthpiece for Wall Street Oasis: Prof MS has a Goldman or bust mentality and is obsessed with brand names and image. There is some obvious validity with the perspective but it is incredibly childish, outdated, boring and suggestive of the anxieties of a college student/teenager\r\n\tInconsistent seminar quality: Prof MS made everyone prepare extensively for 30 min presentations in the final class. Each team spoke for no more than 5 minutes. He spent the rest of the time berating us and giving us obvious advice that smart Yale College kids knew. His concerns would mostly be addressed if he let the students finish the presentation. Prof MS is not a particularly gifted presenter so his way is certainly not the (only) right way. The reality is that Prof MS uses the class as his condescension pet project and likes to listen to himself a lot more than his students and that is disrespectful to the effort students invest in the prep. Many classes reflected this. A rare few didn't\r\n\tToo much of a banker: Prof MS vibe is far more banker than investor. He cares little about the operational or industry-level value of the business and is too focused on corp fin jargon or manipulation of accounting terms. Although he is very critical of modeling monkeys he practices little what he preaches ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - Michael is an absolute gem and made this class the highlight of my senior spring. That said, I am a finance nerd so I found the class very in tune with my interests. "
