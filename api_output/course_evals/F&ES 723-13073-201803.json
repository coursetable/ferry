            "\u00a0Very well, although I wished that there had been more emphasis on the basics of wetlands management, how someone managing a wetland would build a management plan, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained exceeded my expectations. I now see wetlands all around me and understand the many complex ways in which humans impact wetlands (dam, dredging, filling, pollution, etc.) and watersheds in general, as well as how we can help them. ",

I found the non-ecology course material interesting also, and I liked how all the material was inter-related. This made it easier for me to find an entry point and to learn about all the material comprehensively. ",

            "\u00a0Content was very, very good. Mix of classroom lectures, student presentations and field trips was great. I like the once a week format as well. I would be very happy to see a \"part II\" of this class called advanced wetlands or something like that and go even deeper into the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included the field trips, Kealoha, the final project, Mary Burak, the weekly reading response structure, and the readings on dam removal in Week 8.\r\n\r\nIn the early weeks, it felt like we never discussed a lot of the content of the readings. We read about classification systems but didn't delve much into what sets different types of wetlands apart from each other in class. The 3-hour length is also a little tough, but I understand that we don't get the field trips in a shorter time period, so it's manageable. Also, I didn't get as much out of the mini-field trip with Megan Raymond to the sort-of wetland area on Yale's campus. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions we have make sure that everyone's thoughts, ideas, questions, etc. got addressed at length. The field trips were also a great opportunity to get off campus and do in-field soil samples, plant identification, and wetland analyses with professionals. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class provides a great overview of wetlands. The course was well organized and the guest speakers were interesting. I liked the Wetlands in the News and the final presentations. I also enjoyed the field trips. One thing I would change is the reading responses. It was difficult to submit responses by 1:00 pm on Sundays. I often traveled on the weekends and had to be very intentional about completing the assignments. If I did them before the weekend, I would forget some of it by Monday. If I did them over the weekend, it was difficult to find the time. Also, the book was on reserve at CSSSI, but they are not open until 1:00 pm on Sundays. This meant that if you wanted to use the book, you had to go to the library on Saturday. But, the library also closes early on Saturdays. A deadline later on Sundays would have worked better. Additionally, it felt like a lot to come up with a comment and a question for every single reading. I did not always have a question and felt like I was forcing my response at times. Perhaps a choice between a comment or a question would work better. Another thing I would change is the plants. I think it is helpful for students to learn about wetland plants, but it was a little too unstructured. Students who had a background in ecology seemed to be at an advantage. It would have been more helpful to go over the plants in class in a structured lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great in that it incorporated field work, herbarium specimens, and guest speakers. I wish that we could have done a bit more with the herbarium specimens, in terms of practicing identifying plants, wetland types, and other specimens. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The guest speakers and field trips were interesting and also offered a more professional perspective than the other weeks did. We had a great class size. The discussions rarely waned. I liked how we submitted questions about the material before class and our questions were always addressed during class.\r\n\r\nI hope you keep the once-a-week format. ",
            "\u00a0The content was fantastic, having lecture once a week made for a dense Monday. Would have liked to have the class spread over two classes during the week. ",
            "\u00a0The wetlands in the news were awesome, so were the case studies and the guest speakers. I would like more of them. I also felt like classes dragged on for a bit and the lectures could be a little long when we didn't have activities or discussions. The reading posts felt a little useless on some days, and I would have preferred something more active and participatory. ",
            "\u00a0The length of class was good inasmuch as it allowed us to go on short field trips and have long lectures, but it would also be nice to have dedicated field time outside of normal class hours ",
            "\u00a0Field trips were great!\r\nGuest speakers were great!\r\n\r\nI think splitting the course into two sections rather than one long meeting period per week would be better (although the field trips are great, so Im not sure how you could manage this)\r\n\r\nI really liked the flexibility in the final presentations and the wetlands in the news.
