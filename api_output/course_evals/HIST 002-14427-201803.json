            "\u00a0Not only did I learn a lot about New England history, but more importantly in my opinion I learned how to properly evaluate writing, fiction, history, and claims people make about how to represent history. In addition, I more broadly learned how to read in an efficient and proper way, and to think of questions that are relevant to making a faithful representation of the past. ",
            "\u00a0How to read primary source documents and identify biases of the author. I also learned how to consider the context of sources when looking at their purpose and credibility. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skill to speak aloud more frequently and without having the comfort of foreign a well-crafted answer. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skill I developed in this class was how to read, including to evaluate, understand, and compare historical and literary perspectives on the same events. I also developed new insight into events both famous (like Thanksgiving) and that I had never heard of (the regicides)! ",
            "\u00a0I learned extensively about the pilgrims in America, the witch hunts of New England, and the lasting influence of slavery in the modern era. ",

            "\u00a0Often times, this would be the class that I would be looking forward to the most, being able to interact in a small group with such an intelligent professor that would often times get us to think deeper and evaluate people's biases without placing an unnecessary emphasis on grades. I think the course could be improved by maybe making like 2 minute quick jots and having us say them out loud so that more people in the class would be forced to participate and make the discussion more richer and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesring and relevant content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not of the course itself but lack of participation from students ",
            "\u00a0The reading workload could be reduced as oftentimes we had to read a couple hundred pages per day. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was how student-oriented it was and how lively the class discussion was. I think it could be improved by having a few more writing assignments and opportunities to reflect on all the reading we were doing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nClass discussions, while initially directed by the instructor, were often student-led and very interesting and engaging, as we went beyond simply talking about the readings to diving into the meaning and context of each work. With that said, I really liked that we were given a large amount of primary texts to work with throughout the course, because it is very difficult to gain access to such documents outside of class. Also, I liked that we were allowed to choose the format of the written assignment on slavery and our final projects, because this allowed us to be creative in our approach and it got me excited about my assignment since I had the ability to carry it out as I wished. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nWe were not given a sufficient amount of time to read large portions of text, and often times, we would be assigned entire novels to read in only a week or a few days, without any specification on where to focus our attention. As a result, I often felt rushed and a bit scattered as I read each text, because there was so much reading to get through and I didn't know where to focus my attention. Also, there was only one written assignment to do throughout the entire course besides the final project, so we had very few grades for the course. I would have liked to have more assignments beyond the readings, because this would have encouraged me to become more engaged with the course material, and I definitely would have learned and remembered more about the content we covered in class if we had been required to report on the material outside of class. This also would have given me more practice with writing historical papers, which I felt I did not get much practice with at all throughout the course. We also did not go over skills that much, such as how to write like a historian or how to effectively use primary and secondary sources in historical writing, which I thought would have been helpful. To improve upon these things, I think students should be given more time to complete the readings (or fewer readings should be given at once) and more assignments should be given throughout the semester.  I also think more time should be spent in class on skills development, such as how to write a historical research paper and/or how to most effectively use outside sources in your writing. ",
            "\u00a0The reading was sometimes very long, but if it was long Prof. Peterson did not expect ya to finish all of it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are flexibility for students, with weaknesses being a lack of correlation between classwork and homework ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Peterson was an amazing teacher and gave us a great introduction to Yale in general. I really enjoyed the material and working with primary texts, which I hadn't really done in high school--especially while engaging with corresponding literature by well-known New Englanders.\r\n\r\nThe structure could have been a little more regimented--I know it was the professor's first time teaching this course, so it is very understandable that it is not as tight as other courses I took this semester. I had to do a lot of sifting through our readings for the week to find out what was necessary, and not superfluous, as much more was assigned than was discussed in class. Though that is probably a big plus for someone very invested in this kind of history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: taught very well by an extremely enthusiastic professor. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of reading, especially at the beginning of the year. Perhaps decrease reading load by a couple of sources? ",
            "\u00a0strengths- interesting readings\r\nweaknesses- very few assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting subject matter, awesome teacher, great readings\r\nWeaknesses: Did not cover too wide a spread of legends\r\nImprovements:  I liked the class SO MUCH BETTER when it was focused on content, rather than the sort of \"meta\" stuff about how to read or write.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. While I never really considered history in the past, I learned the extreme need for the topic and the fact that it is the way to study the nature of people and actions in the past to prevent catastrophe and be able to deal with new frontiers in effective ways. Also I heard from others that in college you are never really able to do fun readings, but this class allowed me to read classics like the crucible that I never got the chance to read before. Also, the class never caused me stress. Professor Peterson was so understanding of other commitments and was extremely reasonable with the amount of work and expectations that he gave us. The class was a perfect balance of a reasonable amount of reading and a lot of knowledge learned. This class taught me so much, and I think it should be taught every semester every year in an ideal world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a great seminar course that teaches you how to read as a historian with very interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone aspiring to take a first-year seminar. Prof. Peterson's passion for such a narrow subject was inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, even if they aren't interested in history because the course is really about story-telling and literature as much as it is about historical events. ",
            "\u00a0I would, however only if they are interested specifically in the history of New England, as this was the sole focus of the course. (There was not much focus on skills development.) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great intro history course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved Professor Peterson--he is very cheery and encouraging, which is a great thing to have in one's first semester. For those who love American history, the material is incredibly interesting and relevant to a new Yalie. I'm very glad I took this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think it was a very interesting class, and it gives you a new lens through which you see history/the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student seeking an interesting introductory writing course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Not only is it super fun and interesting subject matter, it's also super relevant to Yale itself. It ended up being my favorite class this semester. I knew I had to reevaluate things when I was hoping I didn't get into my \"first choice\" freshman seminar so that I could take this class. Only take if you find history of new england interesting though, you do have to trudge through a lot of old english, but I guess I'm a nut cause I loved loved loved this class. "
