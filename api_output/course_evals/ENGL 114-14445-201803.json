            "\u00a0I learned to write several types of essays which will be common throughout my Yale career. I used a lot of the skills learned in this class in my other concurrent classes so I have a feeling this will definitely pay off in the long run. I learned how to write quality papers in a much shorter amount of time than I used in high school. I also learned just how interesting and talented some of my classmates are here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I improved much as a writer. I learned to improve my creativity and became more insightful as a reader and as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about how to write in an academic setting and how to actively participate in a seminar style class. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to effectively write at a college level, present comfortably, as feel comfortable improvising. ",
            "\u00a0I became aware of the process of writing a research paper and learned the skill of writing quality papers under short notice. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to the American style of academic writing. I believe the biggest issue with my writing was the lack of coherence and the inability to find a claim and stick to it. I learned how to find a claim and provide textual evidence for any argument I put forward. I learned how to somewhat narrow down a stream of ideas and tackle a topic that could be discussed in 5 page essays. I had my first introduction to research paper writing which I feel is going to be greatly useful in the coming years. Being exposed to the technicalities of research in my first year is a great opportunity. I most importantly gained insight about the theme of the class: play. It was linked in many ways to my everyday life and I was glad that whatever we discussed broadened my horizons concerning play. ",

        [
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths was the broad topic which had subtopics to interest all people in the course. I learned a lot about my classmates and the seminar style helped all of us to become friends. The professor did a great job of bringing us all together with games and discussion without stifling any of our ideas. It also didn't have an overwhelming workload which definitely helps to make any class more enjoyable, but it had enough to really feel like we were accomplishing something. ",
            "\u00a0Very interactive and engaging. Weaknesses are there was a lot of essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. It was so fun and engaging, the course material was fascinating and assisted in cultivating learning from many different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the small classroom setting that allows all students a chance to voice their opinions and receive useful feedback from the professor. A drawback is that sometimes I felt that there was not enough time to write the paper we were assigned. This course could be improved by moving on to new assignments/papers only after the current paper is submitted. ",
            "\u00a0The course encourages an actual sharing of ideas and proactive discussion since the class is small. The essays we do each develop a specific skill: the first one requires the close reading of a text, the second one is about referring to texts to do a critical analysis of another text, the third was about the daunting process of research and the fourth one was purely creative. The course is slightly fast paced perhaps in terms of the workload. Starting the p3 was quite daunting and felt like being thrown in the process. But the office hours were really helpful and I am glad I took the class. Perhaps more model essays could help the students to get a better idea of how you should write, but at the same time could prevent the students from being creative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great discussions, bonded with classmates\r\n\r\nWeakness: discussions did not necessarily help with essays "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially for first years. It is a great way to adjust to Yale writing and the resources available here while also forming a community of friends through its seminar style. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely: it was a lot of work but it improved my writing skills immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes i would ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. The structure and content of this class are fantastic and engaging. You constantly engage with a mix of games, music, plays, and text in a way which is interesting and eye-opening. Prof De Leon is helpful, engaging, and accessible and has a true passion for the content which is hard not to emulate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good way to sharpen your writing skills in an introductory and welcoming environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to someone else, specially if they are passionate about music, video games, freestyle rap, in other words play. It is a great opportunity to gain exposure to academic style writing and the course is never boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great for discussion and meeting new friends "
