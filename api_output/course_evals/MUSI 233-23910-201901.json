            "\u00a0We learned how to play a variety of songs related to traditional gamelan and wayang performance. Learned a lot about various SE Asian performing arts, including history, tradition, and adaptations. ",

            "\u00a0Continuation of L1, this class was predominantly about wayang (shadow puppet theater) learning how to perform ",
            "\u00a0Cultural and historical background of Indonesia through the lens of the arts, as we simultaneously honed our skills on the instruments! ",
            "\u00a0I learned in depth about Wayang and its accompanying cultures and forms. I learned about a different part of the world that I have never been exposed to except in gamelan. I also learned how to be in tune with others and work together in a unique way in this ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the culture of Indonesia, in particularly the art of gamelan and its importance. Playing a unique array of instruments was great and I was able to cultivate many relationships. "

            "\u00a0Maho is so kind and patient, and she and Mas Dar are world leading scholars on the topic. The workload is low, the classroom environment is really positive, and people are always excited to come to class! ",
            "\u00a0The course does a very good job through hands-on music, readings, and videos to deepen our understanding. I do not think there are any flaws to this class. ",
            "\u00a0Great class with great balance of readings and practice. The beginning of the course was very heavy with videos to watch, and this was often too much. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing, perfect! Strength is the conversations on the readings we've done during our class time. It reinforces our deeper understandings of what we are doing and is a highlight of this class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, you won't take another class like this. Take it even if you have never played an instrument before, because it is a fun challenge to learn how to play well within an ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it gives you a view of a different culture than very few people ever learn about. There are less than ten universities that offer Indonesian and even less universities that offer gamelan or wayang. This class is crucial in a creating a cultured background for a liberal arts student. ",
