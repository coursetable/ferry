I feel that the professor has loads of information to pass on to the students. that being said. the class sessions were painful to sit through. the professor has a very very hard time verbalizing information and communicating it to others I understand that not many people are good at talking in front of groups of people and that's fine but then the professor should find other ways to convey information. \r\n\r\nthat being said. there were moments where the professor was able to speak to us on a one on one basis. mostly when critiquing our weekly assignments, where I feel he was able to pass on mass amounts of info. most of which I wished he had talked about during lecture.
