            "\u00a0Alright so here's the deal. In, ENAS 335 / Professional Ethics, every week you basically do \"cases.\" By \"cases,\" you read a short article and answer questions directly from the text. It's kind of annoying busywork, but it's not hard to do, and some of the articles are fairly interesting (e.g., bioethics). At the end of the semester, you have to write a 15 page paper on any topic you want. Overall, you don't really have to show up to lectures (the Prof. says she has photographic memory re:attendance but whether that's true, who's to say). At the end of the day you learn a little bit about ethics (Kant, Rawls, etc.), and it's a chill class. P.S., no idea why it's listed as Engineering & Applied Science LOL. ",

            "\u00a0Great overview of philosophical and professional considerations in the field of ethics. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good fifth class if you dont care about learning, but I was honestly super disappointed in this class. A good guy should be pretty easy, but should still make students feel like theyre taking something away from the class. I can honestly say I learned nothing from this course. You will learn the most basic facts about different philosophical theories, but only read a level of depth that you probably reached in a high school English class. Theres also a very low level engagement with course material since the assignments are essentially just reading comprehension exercises. BUT, if youre looking for a wild easy course credit, this is it. I cannot overstate how easy this class is. So go for it if you dont care about how much you learn. ",

However, informational slides could sometimes become monotone and dull which I feel left students unengaged and dosing off to other tasks in their computers. ",
