            "\u00a0I gained an interdisciplinary understanding not only of books, displays, and systems theory, but of a variety of other useful concepts like mimesis, isomorphisms, orality, textuality strange loops, the rhizome, and paradox that have been extremely useful in my literary studies. This added greatly to my own analytical toolkit that has proved extremely useful to me in a variety of contexts throughout this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about semiotics, about critical theory, about rhizomes, about the \"dissolving book;\" there's hardly an end to what I learned! ",
            "\u00a0Everything. Looking at life in a new way and looking at art in a new way. It's a course that baffles, amazes, bamboozles, befuddles, surprises, stuns, and accosts you. You learn how to chunk, push, pop, stack, and clipboard. You learn to re-evaluate art and break out of the sterile shell of western rationalism entering into the realm of loose thought and free association. ",
            "\u00a0This class changed not only how I read but also how I approach life itself. I cannot imagine how different, and worse off, of a person I would be right now if I had not taken Professor Sussman's course. Learning about analog and digital systems, chunking, isomorphisms, the history of the book, Deconstruction, and so many other matters has altered the viewfinder through which I filter daily experience. To put it another way, good courses are those that develop and challenge the intellect. You learn more information and nurture a few critical skills. The best courses, however, are those that develop and challenge the very person to whom that intellect belongs. Books, Displays, and Systems Theory without a architrace of doubt belonged to the latter category. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about everything from James Joyce to hofstader. Evaluating books critically and systematically as they dissolve and jump outside their mediums. It was an incredibly insightful rabbit hole of a class. "

            "\u00a0The multidisciplinary nature of the course combined with the creative freedom of final project made this course very special. We did not adhere too strictly to the syllabus, which allowed for more organic and autopoietic class discussion. There were no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0A brilliant class! ",
            "\u00a0This course was perfect. The professor was willing to engage and make class a great mix of his teaching and thoughts with student engagement with the work. Rather than bombard students with weekly or monthly check ins regarding the weekly assignments, the course culminates in one 20-30 page term paper that shows what you have learned and care about most. Keep everything about this course the same from the reading list to the still of teaching to the professor (although he is retiring so maybe someone similar to his style). ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness that I can imagine about this course is that it had to end and that it was Professor Sussman's last course. The biggest strength of the class was Professor Sussman himself. Without him, the course would have still been interesting, but it would have reached nowhere near the level of profundity that it achieved with him at the helm. The variety of texts - everything from Tristram Shandy to Of Grammatology to Cosmicomics to actual comics - was staggering and might be compared, in Professor Sussman's terms, to the curriculum a galactic liberal arts university. Alongside the texts, class itself was pure joy. Never once did I feel that I was in some dry academic environment. Rather, I felt like I was embarking on a journey with an unknown destination every Monday and Wednesday from 4:00-5:20, trusting wholeheartedly that Professor Sussman would guide our class to that destination by the end of the period.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student of any major with any sets of interests. The reading list and professor combine for a truly incredible and indescribable experiences. You get out of it what you put into it and so long as you do the readings, the class discussion will absolutely and consistently blow your mind. Professor Sussman is a wonderful professor in every imaginable facet, and any course he teaches is more than worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Sussman was fantastic! He's retiring now but he was the kindest and most brilliant professor I have encountered thus far at Yale. The class was a seminar, but when prevailed uopn Professor Sussman could talk in great detail on any subject - and it was incredible to have the opportunity to listen to him! ",
            "\u00a0This class is without a doubt the greatest course (or rather work group) that this institution has to offer. The class is a psychedelic journey through time, space, and the history of the novel (beginning at Gutenberg with his printing press at Mainz and ending at the wonders of contemporary digital art and media). The books in this class range from the earthy and dirty Tristram Shandy to the delightful Pillow Book to Helen DeWitt's smorgasbord of contemporary education to the insanity of Joyce's Finnegan's Wake to the beautiful clipboard of life in Germany in Benjamin's Einbahnstrae (just to name a few), stopping along the way with the dense poetry of Derrida and the strange loops of Hofstadter. Not to mention the best part of the course, you get taken through this journey by the Dante of Yale University himself, Henry Sussman, who is without a doubt the kindest, most caring, funnest, craziest, most insightful professor Yale has to offer, who will always put his student and what they want first. Since Sussman is retiring, I don't know who will teach this course next, but I can only hope it will be someone as full of life and energy as Sussman and that this course will continued to be offered. This may be the most unique course at Yale so it would be a shame if it was not offered again, as it exposes students to everything that their other courses may have denied them (see my comment above about how the course teaches you everything). Take this course if it is offered. You may even learn a thing or two about yourself as a system navigating this world of digital bits. ",
            "\u00a0I could not recommend any class more than this one. Words cannot describe the joy that came over me every time I entered and left the classroom. Not only did I learn an enormous amount about literary and systems theory, but I also discovered how I want to live my life. A discussions of double-binds, for example, prompted me to reexamine many of the ideologies and assumptions that I had previously thought were unchangeable and moved to unbind myself from them. Without this class, for example, I probably would have kept going to church, even though I always felt guilty and knew it was the wrong decision, because, having placed a double-bind on myself, I would have believed that I was obligated to. This class freed me from that line of thought. I owe so much to this class and above all to Professor Sussman, so that even though he is retiring, I would still advocate that anyone wanting a life-altering experience try to at least read the texts that we read. ",
            "\u00a0I wish Professor Sussman would teach all my classes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Sussmans choice of readings and ideas are all incredible and led me to think about art and literature in a completely new way. Would recommend as a very fun, interesting and challenging class. "
