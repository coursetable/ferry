            "\u00a0The professor still often ran the course as a lecture, even though there were only 9 students in the class. I would have appreciated more time to discuss the readings in seminar style. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely. The course explores a topic rarely taught at American universities and does a great job at exploring the political uniqueness of Puerto Rico from the point of view of an insider. Prof. Collado Schwarz is a font of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The history of Puerto Rico is a very tricky subject to teach but the professor did a great job! "
