            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of textual analysis and the ways in which I as a a director can use the text in tandem with my directorial choices. There is also a focus on what one \"sees\" as a director, and the ways in which one throws focus in that way. ",
            "\u00a0I came into the course without any directing experience and leaving the course I feel confident that I would be able to direct a show of my own. Through this course I've been given tools for effectively analyzing the text, visuaizing important images/concepts from a play, staging, and working with actors and designers. I also was able to develop the skill of translating images from the text to an audience in directing scenes. "

            "\u00a0I truly loved everything we did in this course, my only thought would be we spent an incredibly long time, several weeks and many assignments, on the first text JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN, to the point where it was starting to feel like it was impossible to come up with anything new about it, and the other texts got significantly less time. I would also make the second scene study earlier so that more actors are available to be in the scenes, that was the only issue with the planning this time I felt. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly well thought out and the material is presented by Professor Dorfman in an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging, hands-on learning, constructive feedback on assignments, all the assignments given were effective in adding to the director's tool box, small class size allowed for there to be really focused attention on each classmate's work\r\n\r\nWeakness: timing of the scenework maybe could have been different/more spread out "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you're interested in directing or even acting, this course is a must take. You learn so much and Professor Dorfman is one of the most brilliant professors I've ever had the opportunity to work with. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is thinking of developing their skills as a director or actor. The course is riveting and Professor Dorfman is an amazing instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course is a greaat introduction to directing, especially for those who have not directed before. It also helps so much just as a theater-maker in general. I gained so many valuable skills, developing tools for analyzing text and staging to convey your concept of the play through effective staging. The small class size is also great as you get really helpful feedback on your work. You get to direct two scenes in front of the class, with a lot of hands-on learning. Also Toni is just an amazing person to know! "
