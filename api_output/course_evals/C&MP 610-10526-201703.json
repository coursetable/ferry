            "\u00a0I get to see the more clinical side of things. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent. It ventured outside the biological understanding of the pathologies discussed and we  were encouraged to ask questions about how physicians handle logistical, personal and clinical problems related to patients. A patient interview really gave as insights into what being sick means in a day-to-day life of a patient. ",
            "\u00a0Mentored Clinical Experience introduced me to the clinical treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). I was able to interview an IPF patient and observe the medical intensive care unit medical staff responsible for taking care of IPF patients. We also learned about some of the molecular mechanisms behind IPF. Additionally, community and hospital acquired pneumonia were discussed. Finally, we were introduced to a medical pharmacist who discussed the ramifications of antibiotic resistance on clinical practice. "

            "\u00a0I really like the course. I just wish that we can have more variety of topics instead of looking at pulmonary diseases all the time. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: very flexible in the topics discussed and catered to student interest rather than having a rigorously set  structure; patient interview and trips to the MICU ward that were fascinating; very responsive instructors that were interested in having a conversation with us about their respective fields\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of! ",
            "\u00a0The ability to speak with and shadow medical staff is a great opportunity for graduate students and one of the reason I was excited to take the course. Additionally, patient interaction is a unique part of the course that I really enjoyed.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that we did not meet as much as was scheduled. I understand that this is not a limitation of the course or the instructor and just happens to be how the semester panned out, but I would have liked to attend this class more regularly. In addition, I would like to see more integration of shadowing physicians in the clinic and getting to see what is done on a daily basis in regards to the diseases being discussed during lectures. "

            "\u00a0This a great course and offers graduate students a unique opportunity to  learn about how the work done at the bench translates to the clinic. I would highly recommend this course for all students interested in transnational research. "
