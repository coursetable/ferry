He graded fairly and understood the level of difficulty of the exams and homework which he always took into consideration when grading. He was also frequently and readily available to discuss questions or concerns via email, office hours, or an in person meeting. Without a doubt I would take another class with him again. "

However, the professor is phenomenal and I'm sure would be more than happy to help fill in those knowledge gaps so long as you seek help. I've learned a lot about genetics in public health research, but also about all the programming software used for genetics research in general. Wonderful course and extremely recommended. "
