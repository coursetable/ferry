            "\u00a0Connecting very different political philosophy strands and finding points of alignment. Breaking out of the conventional, prejudicial account of a political philosophy and shedding a new light. ",
            "\u00a0I managed to expand my knowledge of Western philosophy as well as the historical underpinnings of Western political thought, and the course seems to serve as one of a few introductory courses to the political philosophy field of the Political Science department at Yale.  Much of my critiques of the class come from my subjective position as having realized that my passion lies in a field other than political philosophy.  This class helped me to realize this fact, and for that I am grateful (this is sincerely an asset of the course and not a jab at Professor Shapiro or the political philosophy field). ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. Professor Shapiro gave us a clear and thorough grounding in Enlightenment era political philosophy, did a great job connecting and comparing different components of the course (Utilitarianism, Social Contract Theory, etc) and was both insightful and thorough. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to weigh my own opinions against others ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the philosophy of the Enlightenment and the Anti-Enlightenment, with modern applications into democratic theory. It was a solid introduction to philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0How to relate views and theories of various political theorists ",
            "\u00a0My thinking about politics and society grew substantially in scale, depth, and sophistication. I came away feeling like a more properly informed citizen. ",
            "\u00a0We discussed the moral philosophies of several different thinkers, including Bentham, Mill, Locke, Marx, Rawls, Nozick, MacIntyre, Burke, and Schumpeter. We also talked about Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightment political philosophy more broadly, as well as democracy at the end of the course. Prof. Shapiro always presented the thinkers' different theories factually, but also made sure to discuss critiques from other philosophers (or his own) and to point out flaws or potential contradictions in their arguments. He also mentioned some of the ways that these different thinkers have been influential on different governments, but perhaps less so than I had expected before taking the course. Overall, this is course is a great introduction to Western political philosophy, but you should expect it to be very theoretical -- Prof. Shapiro always provided concrete examples of how we may see these different doctrines applied to specific situations, but the course is about the theories themselves, not how they have been applied in specific places. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a survey course on political philosophy, and after taking it, I definitely gained a strong overview of different political theorists and a general idea of political philosophy throughout history. I took it writing intensive, which I think really helped me gain a deeper understanding of the texts and helped me improve my writing skills. ",

Essentially, what do philosophers do and why. Over the course of the semester, I realized that our examining our moral belief systems with respect to politics really is important because those impulses guide a lot of what we try to do with policy.

If you took DS, this is more of the 2nd semester people (kind of, but not actually much overlap). You will go over utilitarianism, communism, social contract theory, enlightenment, antienlightenment, democracy.\r\n\r\nGood \"political philosophy\" paper writing experience. ",

            "\u00a0This course was good for learning about what makes a government legitimate. We examined 3 major traditions and then the sub-types of government that would fall under each. Skills related to reasoning about morality and rationality were learned in the course. ",

I developed stronger writing skills in the process. ",

We discussed strengths and weaknesses of each philosophy with respect to its internal and external validity (philosophical consistency and applicability in the real world) and went over common critiques and how the philosophies fit into the larger conversation on political theory. I definitely feel more able to hold a conversation about politics now, and better able to critically assess philosophical conversation. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: depending on your section, can be fairly interesting to discuss the topics; though, the course ended up being what you put into it - if you don't do the reading, you can pretty easily coast by without doing much as the lectures are essentially a summary of them, and if you actually want to do the reading, its pretty rewarding. Not too much work other than the 2 papers (or the midterm if not taken writing intensive), and the final. Reading responses, at least for my section, were very short.\r\nweaknesses: If you don't do the reading, the class doesn't really give you much, though that's not really a weakness of the course itself; unless you're a great writer, you probably won't get an A on the papers, through you probably won't do terribly either ",
            "\u00a0The course is very thorough in covering utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract theory, but it feels a bit rushed at the end in discussing democracy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the lectures were organized, clear, and interesting. Sections did not focus on mere exegesis of the texts, but asked students to engage on the interesting questions the texts posed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a fairly comprehensive expos of the Enlightenment, Anti-Enlightenment, and democratic traditions, perhaps allowing me to more astutely map Western political thought.  However, Western political thought alone--this is not even counting the many non-Western schools of political thought that are routinely ignored at Yale and other Western universities--includes far more schools of thought than those that are either within or adjacent to the Enlightenment.  The lack of breadth in the course might be a natural product of the depth that Professor Shapiro tries to incorporate into characterizing each school of thought.  For example, I appreciate that his teaching of the Marxist tradition does not make the mistake of teaching Marx absent of his history or his existence in a community of similarly-minded activists, and instead he teaches Marx as well as John Roemer and other scholars who concur with Marx while providing critiques of his thought.  However, I found that certain avenues of critiquing the thought of figures studied was more accessible in certain places than in others.  It was mainly lectures that had more space provided for voicing disagreement with the authors (lectures of course having a strong silencing effect), and sections seem somewhat more purposed for understanding what exactly the authors are saying in preparation for X, Y, or Z upcoming test.  This is a problem that seems to permeate introductory political philosophy courses at Yale, and I suspect this problem might be even worse in writing sections where the purpose of both exams and essays is to assess the student's built familiarity with the authors studied. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like Rousseau belonged in the social contract tradition more than he appeared, and he should have been read at the same time as Hobbes, Locke, etc. Admittedly he's then discussed with respect to democracyhis main commitmentbut I didn't feel like he had enough emphasis in social contract theory given how influential he was. I also felt like he was somewhat glossed over in the democracy unit, too. ",
            "\u00a0this course needs efficient TFs to direct discussion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Shapiro is wonderful and his no laptop policy works very well in this class. My TA, Nica, was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well planned. I really have no comments for improvement other than maybe cutting the readings to be more digestable. ",
            "\u00a0Section could be more focused on clarifying the views of the thinkers we learned about ",
            "\u00a0The purse was engaging and Shapiro isnt one of the best lecturers Ive had. \r\nThe average reading load was fine but it was unevenly distributed. Some nights we had only 20 pages, others we had 100. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Shapiro is a great lecturer, and that's a really good strength of the course. He was really good at coming up with interesting examples of different situations where these thinkers' theories could be applied and where they might break down, and he did a good job of making the lectures engaging. The readings for this course were also very relevant, since it was good to be able to read all the thinkers in their own words. \r\n\r\nMy main critique is that the course didn't really have enough capacity for the number of students who wanted to take it writing intensive. I was (barely) able to take it writing-intensive, and that definitely made a big difference in the way the semester went for me -- taking it writing intensive definitely helped me learn the material more thoroughly and challenged me a lot more than taking it regular would have. For that reason, I really think that  any student who wants to take it writing intensive should be able to, and Prof. Shapiro and the TFs should adjust the number and sizes of the sections if necessary to try and accommodate those students. \r\n\r\nI also felt like most of the interactions that I had with an instructor were with my TF, not Prof. Shapiro. That's just a product of the way that the course is set up, and I suppose it makes sense given the number of students taking the course, but I would have liked it if Prof. Shapiro would have encouraged us to come to office hours more. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course is definitely Prof Shapiro -- he is an expert in the field, and his passion for the subject shines through in his teaching. He also makes the class interactive at several points throughout the lecture, which definitely makes the class interesting. I don't really think there are many weaknesses, except maybe going quickly over one or two of the thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0Shapiro is a fantastic lecturer and does well navigating the class. I felt though that the TFs were somewhat unhelpful given they largely did not help me understand the philosophies any better but just offered some case studies or had us discuss them amongst ourselves. Additionally, the review sessions basically had little organization and featured multiple TFs just contradicting one another. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: comprehensive\r\n\r\nWeakness: readings tend to not be the most necessary, let alone engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the material is very well chosen, and the lectures do a very good job of pointing out what is important to know about each writer that we talked about. Shapiro knows the material so well that nothing in his lectures is extraneous or vestigial--everything he says is intentional and important. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, interesting, engaging despite of being a lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes dwell on too easy materials, then glide over hard things. We lose the subtleties of each thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Really wonderful course! Lectures are super well-organized, and section was very informative. ",
            "\u00a0This class is VERY what you make of it. I treasure the opportunity I had to learn about all of these texts and there were always resources I could use to push myself farther. Many didn't and did fine. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting ",
            "\u00a0Because it is a lecture, it is possible for a student to go to class and not be very engaged with the material. However, Shapiro is a very good lecturer and the content is interesting if the student is invested. Section really helped unpack and clarify the ideas from class. I would have maybe liked a few more examples of real life policy debates, not just hypothetical situations, although those were often interesting and helpful. oVerall, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Clear lectures from Shapiro, who is deservedly a giant in the field and knows the subject cold. Lecture slides could be a bit more detailed my notes were thorough and I still sometimes struggle to match what I wrote to slides during review. ",
            "\u00a0Not much opportunity to practice. Took it WR and there are 2 papers (about 10 pages each) and 1 final exam (completely 1 essay response). I wish I had more opportunities to practice writing arguments. Not too much of an idea about what kind of papers were expected of me before I started this class.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a lot of difference between the different TFs. Most of them are well-versed in SOME of the political theorists, but not ALL of them, which means they are less clear about the concepts during some sections. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is structured pretty rough for the normal section. You only have a midterm, which is worth 30% of your grade; a final (50%); and discussion. So, this puts a lot of pressure on yourself to perform well on exams. I think that if a paper (5-6 pages) was thrown in the mix it would be better so that you can receive feedback earlier for later assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This survey of philosophy was almost too broad, such that I feel I can only speak generally about political philosophy, rather than provide a more in-depth account of any one philosopher/theory. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were engaging, but they could have been more connected. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is that Ian is a good lecturer and as long as you're doing the readings or walking into class with some understanding of the philosphers, it shouldn't be to hard to follow. \r\nA weakness is that shopping period is nothing like the actual class. The first couple of lectures deal with issues form the Holocaust and Rwandan Genocide, so you think that these ideas will be applied to modern situations and you get to discuss the philosophers in a current context. But as soon as shopping period is over that never happens again. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as though we didnt really go into depth with the authors. I would have rather learned about less authors and understood them better rather than knowing all the ones we covered and not really having an in depth understanding of them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shapiro is a great lecturer. The course could be improved if sections were standardized across the board. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - clear, precise, interesting. \r\nWeaknesses - doesnt address autocracies or other systems of government and compare them properly with democracy. Also, I wish it discussed systems in different contexts such as developing countries. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides excellent analysis on the thinkers we read, particularly in terms of identifying criticisms of their theories. I feel this course helped me develop a framework through which to understand large questions about governance and representation. The course effectively deployed real-world examples to contextualize arguments made. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvements, I think it should be more clear at the start of the course that it will build to Shapiro's argument about strong two-party democracy. I felt that his theory was perhaps unfairly given weight over others (for instance, other thinkers did not have the opportunity to respond to criticisms of their theories like Shapiro did). In addition, I felt our coverage of Marx was somewhat confusing, because it didn't seem to fit in with the larger trajectory of the course from enlightenment to democratic thought (i.e. Marx seems substantially different from other enlightenment thinkers). ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more standardization in grading and across TA teaching, but that's a potential issue with any class. I also wish we spent more time on the democratic tradition because although I appreciated the emphasis on utilitarianism etc., I felt that we rushed through the last 1/3 of the course, which had 8 or so thinkers, compared to spending a lot of time on a few (very important) thinkers at the beginning of the year. ",
            "\u00a0I dont have a terribly strong idea. I just think Shapiro is a good lecturer. In terms of weaknesses, I wish we had some smaller quizzes or comprehension checks. That would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the students were very obnoxious in class. In particular, a group of white guys almost exclusively on the debate team would interject pedantic and irrelevant points in convoluted language that confused the entire lecture hall on a daily basis. Other than that, it was great. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is that Professor Shapiro's teachings are extremely clear. He was very thorough in his slides and presentation of the major thinkers which made learning the material much easier. I don't see any areas in which the course could be improved as I found it helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized, and Professor Shapiro is an intelligent and eloquent lecturer. Sometimes he seems a little pretentious, but is definitely capable of keeping his lectures conversational. The lectures are expertly designed to simplify and modernize the complicated texts we read for homework. Indeed, the readings were often tedious and there were a lot of them, but doing all the readings really is helpful, not just for a grade but as a foundation for understanding how philosophy papers work anyway. I took the class writing-intensive, and found that the papers were very harshly graded, but the opportunity to edit your papers before handing in a final draft was definitely helpful and allowed be to better my writing. Honestly, though, the class is very dependent on your TF. If you don't have a good TF, section can make the material more confusing than it was before... ",

            "\u00a0I think Profesor Shapiro was a great lecturer who knew a ton about the material. Very few weaknesses, and If there are weaknesses, they are with the relevance of Political philosophy not the way the ideas are presented. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting. Section oftentimes felt unhelpful to understanding lecture content. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Shapiro is an engaging lecturer and tried to apply the theoretical material to real life. The work level was reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the material was kind of boring, I am not sure if I agree with the way the syllabus was organized in terms of the different units and in terms of what readings were did when. The arc didn't really make sense. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught incredibly well by Professor Shapiro. He was engaging and thoughtful in his lectures. However, the policies with regard to section and its teaching were problematic. ",
            "\u00a0Covers a lot of material, but is generally spread thin and poor at comparing different themes and authors in course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and the readings were relevant. I would suggest making sure the readings are actually going to be useful and discussed in either lecture or section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures were all very engaging. Professor Shapiro is brilliant and very articulate, and he does a good job engaging the class in lecture. The structure of the class was also pretty good, with each lecture covering different thinkers and their main arguments and counterarguments against each thinker. I also really enjoyed section because the discussion was always really interesting and helped contextualize century-old ideas to the modern day.\r\nWeaknesses: Overall, pretty good course. Sometimes there would be a really heavy reading load, but the readings weren't always super necessary to understand the material. My main comment is that I would've liked the final test to have a more information-based section; as is, it's just one long essay that's a bit difficult to prepare for and doesn't necessarily summarize everything we've learned. ",
            "\u00a0This course was definitely political philosophy rather than applied politics or examining political theories in action, which wasn't made clear from past course reviews. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was organized well in the way that the syllabus moved between thinkers and philosophical movements.\r\n\r\nI, however, think the class could be improved by doing more to make sure the TFs teach the material similarly // provide the same level of close engagement with text during section. ",

The section on democracy was the most confusing, though. \r\n\r\nI really think that Yale College in general needs a better system for improving the quality of teaching in sections across the board -- either incentivizing students to engage more during section, or meeting students where they're at (maybe it's inevitable that the time spent in section will be so much less engaging than in seminar?). Also, I am worried that section quality is decreasing with the expansion of the new colleges as TAs teach further afield from their expertise/interest. ",

I would have appreciated seeing even more comparisons of the old theories to present policies, in order to have more examples to which one can apply the theories. This would aid the further understanding of the theories. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The lectures were organized, clear, and interesting. Sections did not focus on mere exegesis of the texts, but asked students to engage on the interesting questions the texts posed. ",
            "\u00a0If you're serious about learning political philosophy, take it as a WR credit. While most of the lectures were pretty solid, I personally didn't find Professor Shapiro an engaging or well-organized lecturer, so I know I wouldn't have had an incentive to keep up with the readings throughout the semester if I didn't have to use them for writing the papers. Some of the readings are also dense, technical, and boring. However, I find the material itself to be quite fascinating. Also, go into this class knowing that what you learn here isn't the end all, be all of what these thinkers believed and argued for. Additionally, KEEP IN MIND THE COURSERA VERSION OF THIS COURSE THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. I found Professor Shapiro in these lectures to be more engaging and more organized; arguments and information were much easier to follow. ",

Because of this, I would not recommend this course to a student who is not interested in exploring the intricacies of the thought of Alasdair MacIntyre, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, John Rawls, and adjacent philosophers.  If interested more in critical theory or perhaps cultural or ethnic studies, another course, field of Political Science, or department might be more appropriate. ",

I think it helped me understand modern debates much better, and taught me a lot about the history of political philosophy and where many of our ideas come from.

The class itself does not require a lot of work, and it's possible to get by without doing a lot of the readings. However, it is really important that you pay attention to what Shapiro summarizes from them in class. Getting an A is not impossible, but also not that easy. You have to really know the material on both exams or write really good papers. (I took it non-writing intensive). For non-writing students, there really very little work outside of the exams, but you have to study well for the final if you haven't been doing the readings. I skimmed a bit of most of the readings but studied hard for the final. I don't have my grade yet but I think it will be A- range. ",

The topics are interesting and Shapiro does a great job keeping the lectures engaging. Whether you take the writing section or not definitely makes a difference in how involved you are in the course - I had a great TA and section, and so felt compelled to keep up with readings to support my conversations and writing. I would certainly recommend this course even if you are unsure; just make sure you are willing to take the time to delve into the material yourself. ",

This is NOT a political science course (it is part of political science, but not only what polisci entails). \r\n\r\nIt is NOT A GUT and NOT AN EASY A. You will really have to craft some new and unique arguments, and a lot is expected of you. I wish there were more opportunities to practice and get feedback. If you take it WR, there are 2 papers (10 pages each) each with a rough draft and final draft and one final. The final is a 3 hour exam and you simply write 1 essay (that's it) during the entire 3 hours; it is open note closed book (usually).\r\n\r\nYou should go to class, but also there is selective information to make it more manageable workload, but sometimes this means that you aren't getting the full picture. Still is a GOOD CLASS though and I think I learned a lot. You really get to think a lot in this class. ",

Though I haven't taken Intro to Political Philosophy, I've heard this is the better of the two courses because it is more concretely connected to modern day phenomena. I found the lectures super interesting and the workload to be extremely manageable (granted, I didn't take it writing intensive), but the mid-term and final were straight forward. ",

Even if you're not, it's a good foundation and introduction to information that's pretty fundamental to the way our societies and governments function. Professor Shapiro is a diamond in the rough and has so much background knowledge and expertise that it's definitely a privilege getting to listen in on his thoughts. It's a tough class with tough concepts to wrap your mind around (at least for some people) but once you do it makes a lot more sense. If you don't attend lecture, older versions of Shapiro's lectures are on OYC and Coursera, although he obviously revises material annually so you might miss some things. I didn't really do the readings but I feel like I would have enjoyed and understood the course a lot more if I had. Because of the lack of assignments, it's easy to not really engage with the material, but it'll bite you in the butt come paper/exam time. ",

Other than that, I think it's possible to still get a lot out of the course just by going to lecture and doing some of the readings. ",

Even though it's still not really my thing, I feel like MoFoPo has equipped me with great deep-thinking skills and with good background on famous political thinkers and theories that are generally important for anyone to know. The class is also organized really well and taught well, so I never felt like I was wasting my time by coming to lecture or doing readings for no purpose. I also took the class writing-intensive which was a little daunting at first, but I would definitely recommend it. If I hadn't, I don't think I would have retained anything (or been motivated to actually do most of the readings on time). ",
