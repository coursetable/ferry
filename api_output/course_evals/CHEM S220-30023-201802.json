            "\u00a0I learned the basics of reactivity in organic molecules and how to think about solving different problems. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of the chemistry of alkenes, alcohols, epoxides, and Grignard reagents. I also developed the insight of using sterics and electronics to predict reaction mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent introduction to organic chemistry. It covered many fundamental concepts that are necessary to understand in order to continue learning in more advanced chemistry classes. ",
            "\u00a0electron pushing! how to think creatively and out of the box! ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a significant amount of organic chemistry in a very short amount of time. In fact, it even helped me gain a much greater understanding of the more difficult concepts in general chemistry thanks to the review at the beginning and the in-depth topics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about organic chemistry and most likely somewhat trained my brain to think in a particular manner as a result of taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough knowledge of organic chemistry, as well as more widely applicable methods of scientific thinking and problem solving. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor and TAs put in so much work for the class! I really appreciated how the notes were written ahead of time and uploaded to Canvas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the pacing was a little uneven--some days we finished 15 minutes early, while other days we rushed until the end of class. Being able to go at an even pace would help with learning for me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear lectures, fair tests, in-class problems facilitate student learning a great deal.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could at times be slightly rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class (lecture daily, section 3x a week) was very beneficial for learning, as it allowed for time to digest more difficult ideas and provided multiple opportunities to ask questions and go over confusing topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor DiMeglio was very straightforward about what she wanted you to learn about, she made you feel hopeful\r\nWeakness: the pace of the class during the summer time ",
            "\u00a0I actually think this course was great the way it was. I think it would have been more student-friendly if the overall grade was composed of more than just 3 tests. Perhaps other, smaller grades could be added to help alleviate the anxiety surrounding each exam. ",
            "\u00a0It was very helpful to have access to the slides used in class as I often did not have enough time to write everything down.  I found the class to be surprisingly fast-paced but I believe this was necessary as result of how much material needed to be covered.  The teaching was very good and the in class problems were helpful to do. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall this course is very strong. Any weaknesses that come to mind are not due to the instructor or course structure, but rather due to how compressed the course needs to be to fit into the summer session. \r\n\r\nI specifically like how many practice problems are assigned, because these are so essential, and I also like the slides that are pre-made and then laid out after the lecture so we can ask questions about them. ",
            "\u00a0Notes are clear and easy to follow ",
            "\u00a0Only because it was a summer course, I felt as though we were rapidly rushing through material, which it made it very difficult to master topics prior to the exams. But Mrs. DiMeglio was very fair, especially giving extra problems on the final exam. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Taking the course in the summer allows you to put in the time and effort it needs without other classes and obligations getting in the way. It's taught super well, and the material is needed for a lot of majors and programs. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Lectures are clear and interesting, tests are fair, and the grading is fair. There is no graded homework. Students should spend 1-3 hours studying the material every day, though; this will ensure high grades on the tests. To any students who are reading this: make sense of the mechanisms using principles like electronegativity and sterics; do NOT try to memorize anything without making sense of it. Also, it is a good idea to read the corresponding textbook chapter and lecture slides before going to lecture, so you do not get lost from seeing a lot of new material all at once. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course -- it helped me to understand the material for my other pre-med classes like biochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students who are afraid of taking it. During the summer there is a lot of extra guidance and help, and although it seems daunting it is a good environment for students to learn well and succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Over the summer is the best time to take it. You can focus solely on it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  It is challenging and certainly has a reputation but it was a rewarding experience for me and the teaching was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is great for a summer session science class and very well taught. It's basically as good as a summer session science class could possibly get. However, it is still a summer session science class which means that it will be extremely accelerated with a ton of material condensed into a really short time. I would recommend this class if you are organized and on top of your stuff, and feel well equipped to take on a fast-paced and difficult class. Also, while orgo can be kind of fun and interesting, I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't need it for their major or pre-professional track. ",
