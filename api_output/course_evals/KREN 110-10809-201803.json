            "\u00a0This course provided more than sufficient practice within both Korean speaking and writing. After completing the course, I feel very comfortable reading Korean characters and describing basic day-to-day activities and stories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of Korean through effective written and oral practice, in and out of class. ",
            "\u00a0Learned korean ",
            "\u00a0We got a solid grasp of common but many versatile, pretty powerful verbs, grammar patterns, and sentence structures used in real conversations. This class is truly a model template for anyone looking to build a foundation for further Korean language study! ",
            "\u00a0A passion for Korean, understanding of grammar, appreciation for culture. ",
            "\u00a0Daily conversation skills and basic understanding of Korean culture ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of the Korean alphabet, and learned quite a bit of grammar. I learned some vocabulary, which was very very heavy. We also learned about Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Hangul and some interesting aspects of everyday life like holidays and the subway system. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is that it focuses a lot on speaking practice in class, which I think is useful especially for beginners in Korean. A weakness of the course is that the pacing can sometimes be all over the place, and it is sometimes unclear what the homework/quiz assignments are. The latter can easily be solved by asking the professor to clarify at the end of the class, however. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a lot of great practice in terms of learning the language, however, I feel as though it wasn't organized well. Canvas was never really updated correctly so it was hard to determine which assignments were due on which days, leading to confusion and several late submissions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught fabulously. Professor Lee-Smith was an excellent instructor who ensured that all her students were learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course is ideal for learning- homework every day but so little that it doesn't feel like a burden and you learn so much cumulatively by the end of the year with what will feel like minimal effort ",
            "\u00a0This was the most engaging and fun class I've ever taken at Yale, actually! Our instructor is enthusiastic, closely attentive on a personal and class-wide level, sensitive to differences in individual ability, intuitive as a teacher, consistently professional and hyper-organized, and trustworthy and warm. The only weakness I can think of is that too many print-outs per day wastes a lot of paper. ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength of this course was the instructor. Angela Lee-Smith is committed, caring, passionate, and empathetic. She made this course amazing for me and the other students. She was always looking out for us and seeking to stretch our knowledge. She was especially very patient with me, as I often had other commitments, and made me love Korean. ",
            "\u00a0I think more focus on pronunciation throughout the course (not just in the beginning) would have been helpful for me. I think everything else is a strength! ",
            "\u00a0The course went at a pace that made it easy to keep up. There were also a lot of activities that made the course more interesting. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. I have never taken a more engaging and entertaining language class at Yale. This course, and the Korean language program, and the professors are a blessing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the Korean language, but be prepared for a pretty heavy daily workload. The end results will definitely be worth the hard work during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Korean to any student, whether it be a first year to a senior. Learning a new language is an asset and the Korean department does a fabulous job at instruction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- 100% take this class, if not for the great Korean professors or the love of kPop, for the GPA boost ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely everyone who wants to learn Korean, or at least build a stronger foundation for self-study of more sophisticated Korean, ought to take this class. It's a blast and actually teaches you to be very creative about using the vocabulary and grammar patterns you do know. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a great primer to the Korean language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great class without adding too much burden on your daily routine ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was engaging and fun, and Professor Lee-Smith is incredible-- she is one of the most caring and excellent teachers I have ever had, and she makes some dang good tteokbokki. Take this course if you're interested in learning Korean and learning about Korean culture, and if you want to become friends with your classmates. ",
            "\u00a0If your interested in Korean, this class is great! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you're interested in Hangul, this class is a fun way to get started. "
