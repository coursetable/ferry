I hope it can have more improvise writing in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Students can communicate with each other freely and develop the ability of critical thinking. Also, the feedbacks and suggestions of my performance are very clear and useful.\r\nWeaknesses and ways to improve: Some students were too shy to take part in the interaction. To ensure that everyone gets involved in the class, I suggest that teacher can come up with more ideas to encourage those students. "

What's more, this template taught me how to communicate with others, that is to say, how to understand and report others' statements and voice my opinions. "
