            "\u00a0Love italain! Learned better reading skills and comprehension skills ",
            "\u00a0Italian 130 isnt a particularly exciting class (especially if youre someone only taking it to finish up the language requirement), but Simona does everything she can to make it a pleasant experience, and will definitely help you build on skills you learned in L1 and L2. A lot of the year reviews things taught in previous semesters, but I felt like the course helped me achieve a greater degree of mastery over this material. The course also definitely improved my speaking skills since Simona provides lots of opportunities to speak in class. ",
            "\u00a0Improved Italian grammar and conversational skills. Learned about Italian culture and customs. ",
            "\u00a0I became a bit more fluent in my italian skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course builds on the vocabulary and skills taught in the introductory courses. Students review all of the previous tenses (present, perfect, imperfect, imperative, conditional, future, etc.), covering the greater subjunctive and the passato remoto more thoroughly this time around. A lot of the vocab is similar to previous lists, but there are some new words as well. This class focuses more on developing students' conversational skills by encouraging discussions with classmates. There is also a large emphasis on Italian culture and literature, which includes reading prominent works and writing original responses. "

            "\u00a0The class is awesome. Engaging. Interactive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: high student-teacher engagement, constant assessment, comfortable and encouraging learning environment created in the classroom\r\nWeaknesses: online workbook is annoying because it takes time. Really the only weakness of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness of the course is that students who did the summer program are grouped with everyone else. I think this hurt the class dynamic since students who had a 8 week immersive experience are clearly going to have a greater grasp of the language compared to students who studied the language in an isolated classroom setting. In my class, student who had completed the Sienna program were much stronger at Italian, and often were the most vocal and sped up the pace of the class, which was frustrating for students who had not gone on the program. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes place in a small setting with only about 15 students in the class which means that the professor can engage with all of the students and really help them improve. This is a great course with a large amount of feedback to help students and we spent a lot of time practicing talking in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pretty laid back & relaxed which I really appreciate in a language class\r\nWeaknesses: You don't \"learn\" many new things (mainly just reviewing old things and practicing fluency) which can make the class seem slow. ",
            "\u00a0When learning a language, it is important to review a lot, as many concepts do not necessarily stick the first time around. I think it is important to consistently practice old skills so that one does not forget. That being said, I feel like I did not learn a lot in this course. It is one thing to go over previous lessons, but almost all of the material was identical to the intro course. I think it is important to review tenses, but my greatest limitation at the moment is not my ability or inability to conjugate verbs, but rather my lack of vocabulary. Unfortunately, the vocabulary taught in this course did not build on the words I already learned in previous level. I think this course could be improved by teaching completely new vocabulary, while reviewing familiar tenses. I would have been happy to do the extra work of committing these new words to memory because it would have improved my language skills (the main reason why I took the class, not to fulfill a requirement). Overall, I think the students will be more engaged and feel more confident speaking, writing, and reading Italian if they had more vocabulary with which to work. Sure, the students can study vocab on their own if they want more of a challenge, but realistically, very few students will be as motivated with all of the distractions and commitments that they have going on outside of the class. Thus, by making new vocab a requirement of the course--including tests or quizzes on such words--students will actually be motivated to learn the material. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I love italain! My favorite class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I always recommend the Italian department to people I meet. They are so friendly, they want you to learn Italian, and very accommodating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes please take Italian it is the best language here at Yale University. Italian culture is so interesting and the language is beautiful. Its a very chill language credit too if thats all you want out off it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning Italian, definitely take L3. Youll learn a lot about the language. If you are like me and just trying to fulfill your language requirement, I would still recommend Italian. Its a great department w supportive professors and the work load is a lot more reasonable than other languages. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The Italian department is amazing and it is such a fun language to learn! ",
            "\u00a0If you've got to take it, you've got to take it. Definitely better than most other Yale romance languages, but for me, it was still a drag. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students looking to solidify their Italian skills. Students receive consistent and clear feedback on their essays, greatly benefiting their writing skills. After taking the course, I feel WAY more confident speaking the Italian language and about the culture. Also, Professor Lorenzini is incredible, so if she is teaching, definitely take the opportunity to get to know her as a teacher and a person! "
