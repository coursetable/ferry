            "\u00a0I learned more about the art of a time period I had never really studied before and I learned to appreciate that art (pottery, textiles, glass), which I hadn't really before the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about the material culture of Eurasia and refined my visual analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned of the different cultures and material objects along the area of the Silk Road. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about pieces of art with very little background information or research. I learned to analyze the purpose, origin, and motifs of an object based on its visual cues. \r\nIn terms of content, the course focused on the art of the Silk Road region, so I retained a lot about patterns in artistic choices in the region over time. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of interesting material regarding the Silk road, its dynamism, evolution, regions, and artifacts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about common themes, motifs, and cultures throughout the Silk Road. Despite falling asleep and not paying attention in class, here are some things I remember from this class: Buddhism was a major religion, Sogdians! Pearl roundels! Tang Dynasty China was super cosmopolitan! Camels are the beasts of burden! Glass! CULTURAL DIFFUSION!!! "

            "\u00a0Could use better organization (i.e. a roadmap at the start of every class, one module that goes over the people of the Silk Road / general history before going into the artworks.) ",
            "\u00a0Mimi is an incredible professor, but the organization of the class was a little lacking. It didn't really seem like there was a reason for the way objects were presented during lecture. It was a bit jumbled, but overall interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture would be easier to follow if the slides on the screen had captions ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting but was presented in a disorganized way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course content is well organized into the modules and the master images. The visits to the Art Gallery during section were also a fantastic addition to this course.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel that the syllabus nor the required texts were very useful. It is easy to miss this class and not feel behind. ",
            "\u00a0Summary strength - broad and interesting topic covered effectively by a passionate instructor! ",
            "\u00a0The concept of this class was really interesting, seeing the how the arts of the Silk Road reflect the cultural diffusion that took place because of this trade route (very AP World in that way). However, I found it very difficult to stay focused on the class lectures (maybe it was because of lack of sleep, the class being after lunch, the lecture being in the dark lecture room in the basement of Loria, or a combination of all three). The content required for the midterm weren't too difficult or time consuming to write, and the midterm was pretty much based off of memorizing artifacts posted on a Canvas master sheet. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course either if you are interested in the subject matter, or if you are an art history major and you need an intro course - it is one of the better intro courses available. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Yiengpruksawan and Cindy are kind, responsive, and excellent instructors.  The material itself is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this as a interesting art history course with minimal stress, ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student looking for a more theoretical, big-picture view of the art history of the Silk Road. The skills we learned are applicable to other artistic/humanities disciplines which was valuable. \r\nHowever, someone looking for a more comprehensive overview of the art of Eurasia might be disappointed at how quickly the course is paced and how little time is spent on each work of art examined in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you would like an intro-level, lecture-style art history course and are interested in this region and its art. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about the art of the Silk Road (it's a refreshing twist to the more often studied Western canon of the art world), or also art majors who need an art history credit that won't be too time consuming (outside of memorizing artifacts and writing a few short papers)--it's a relatively chill class.
