Throughout the course, I felt that I had to teach myself everything from notes online, because section was rarely helpful either. The reading was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is a foundational course with some amazing ideas.  But Professor DeRose taught it pretty terribly.  He's an excruciatingly slow lecturer, and because he gets sidetracked a lot it's usually not even particularly clear what's going on.  The amazing TA's were the only reason I got to understand the material any better than I would have by just reading the texts myself.  Also, having 2 exams and only 1 paper was unusual for a philosophy class but also made it lower-stress than if there had been more papers. ",
            "\u00a0The works that are examined in this class are very challenging and it is difficult to gauge what an accurate reading of the texts consists in between one's own reading, the professors, and the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0The relationship between certain thinkers could be more clearly conveyed. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class, I took it for a distribution requirement, so I should not tell it how to do it's job. ",
            "\u00a0Section is incredibly helpful in working through often hard-to-follow texts and lectures. It is imperative to stay on top of the reading, but if you do, lecture is interesting and helpful. ",

            "\u00a0I though the lectures were great and the amount of reading was appropriate for an intro philosophy course. However, I thought we should have read Spinoza instead of Reid. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame the course has to have tests. Maybe it would be better to have the in-class midterm exam, but instead of a final exam we could have two papers due throughout the semester instead of one. This would give students more practice writing philosophy papers, preparing them better for the major in which written tests are very rare. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures, great distribution of work ",
            "\u00a0I found lecture confusing and unnecessary to go to. The readings and the section were much more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a disproportionate amount was spent on Reid, and not nearly enough time (2.5 classes) was devoted to covering Kant, who is arguably the most important philosopher in this course. Additionally, too much time is spent on Descartes, whose arguments are really rather simple as compared to someone like Kant or Leibniz. Additionally, the written midterm and final are quite difficult (unless you're good at writing in-class essays). I also found the class to be a bit dull at times. One should also be advised that this is a very very fundamental course, dealing with fundamental epistemological ideas, so things like phenomenology or Marxism are not discussed at all. ",
            "\u00a0Its very easy to skip readings, but theyre essential to actually getting something out of the course, so maybe devise some way to check that people have read? Maybe during discussion sections, with a designated discussion time at the beginning? ",
            "\u00a0This course has a great reading list, but I felt that the structure of the course (midterm, final, and paper) didn't encourage learning. I think it would be better if there were smaller assignments throughout the semester, perhaps in addition to the midterm, final, and paper. ",

            "\u00a0The course covers some deeply interesting material, primarily dealing with the limits of our knowledge and the nature of our experience. Prof DeRose is highly enthusiastic about the material and is able to bring the philosophers to life, though he might occasionally ramble or be hard to follow. There are tests in the course, but the topics for the final are released ahead of time and are a great incentive to really firm up your knowledge on the material taught. Possible steps for improvement might be to increase the number of papers instead of having 2 exams, focusing the paper on philosophers covered in the second half of the course, and having slightly clearer notes with more obscure terms being clearly defined. ",
            "\u00a0Since this is a survey course, it does a nice job of introducing philosophers and philosophical concepts to people who (like myself) have no previous exposure to the subject. Readings and workload are generally light. There are only three grades (midterm, essay, and final) for the class, though, so there is a lot of pressure on each one of these assessments. The essay in particular is difficult to write if you have never written a philosophy paper before. Another weakness of the class is that the lectures often feel disorganized and more like stream of consciousness. Fortunately, I had an amazing TA who clarified and explained the material well. This class mostly involves understanding, regurgitating, and synthesizing the material presented to you; while there are some opportunities in section and with the essay to develop your own ideas, critical engagement is relatively low. ",
            "\u00a0I seriously disliked this course. I found it extremely disengaging. I feel like it actually might be better if there were more essays because then you could actually engage with the material and practice philosophy. I frankly didn't learn much from going to lecture, and I think it made me more confused. "

I thought the lectures were very good, and the readings were very enjoyable. Both TFs in the course were excellent and lead great sections. Definitely try to get into a smaller section if possible.

            "\u00a0As someone who has never taken a philosophy class, this was a decent introduction. Prof DeRoses's lectures and handouts sometimes felt a bit scattered, but it was definitely worthwhile to go to lecture. The course seemed to get progressively more challenging (Descartes and Leibniz were much easier to understand than Kant). 1 midterm paper, 1 written midterm, 1 final exam (with essay questions released beforehand), so not a gigantic workload. My TA was Allison Glasscock and discussion sections with her were wonderful (and at times more helpful than actual lecture). Definitely stay on top of the reading for this class! ",

            "\u00a0This course was interesting and tried to cover a lot of material. Most of the philosophers were covered well, except Kant, who was hardly covered at all. Lectures were interesting, and the professor was engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because having a background in the argumentative lessons of philosophy is good ",

            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in philosopher's ideas about the limits of our knowledge, the nature of our world and our experiences. It's also a great way to firm up your writing/speaking skills, and engage critically with difficult-to-parse abstract concepts. Don't expect any real answers to questions though, and be sure to take advantage of office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if your goal is to gain some initial exposure to philosophers like Descartes, Locke, Reid, Leibniz, and Kant. Lectures are kind of disorganized and not many people attended, but I thought they were interesting. The material is cool and, if you make an effort to engage with the readings and develop your own thoughts and critical opinions, it can be very rewarding. Assessments are fair (especially if you attend lecture), but they are stressful since there are only three all semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course at all. Unless you seriously are considering philosophy, I wouldn't take it, at least not with the way it is taught now. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an excellent overview of the tenets of modern philosophy, and I highly recommend taking it. The one paper assignment was given two months before it was due, and you are given much insight into what to study for the essays on the exams. It is difficult to grasp and remember topics, but this course is a great, low-pressure course that allows you to have a taste of complex philosophy if you are interested. "
