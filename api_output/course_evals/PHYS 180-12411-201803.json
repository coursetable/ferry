            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor posts ALL of the lecture notes and they are very comprehensive! I would recommend still going to class, but these were a great resource for going back over material you weren't sure about. Also the weekly psets, while long and complicated, were usually helpful for reinforcing concepts learned in class and made sure that I kept up to date with the material. There are so many resources available--Professor Steinacker herself was available at her daily office hours; the TAs and peer tutors were extremely helpful at explaining and interpreting the really long problems on homeworks; study guides and review sessions were very helpful. Also you get points back on the exams!\r\nWeaknesses:  It is definitely a challenging course that requires you to keep up, and sometimes the homeworks were very complicated and took a while to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets for this course are both a strength and a weakness. They eat up a lot of time, but they make studying for the exams a lot easier. ",
            "\u00a0I think the fact that this class is marketed to those with little/no physics background is a travesty. The professor expects a large amount of preparation in both physics and mathematics, and does not well cover the topics with regards to those who may have no experience.  The professor cares a lot about the topic and is obviously very intelligent, but I think she is far too intelligent to teach physics at such an introductory level. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is how interesting the PSETS are and how much easier the exams are than the PSETS. Do not be intimidated! Just have some fun solving math problems, then take it easy before the exams ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is a great professor, and there are plenty of resources to succeed in class, such as office hours, peer tutors, and comprehensive lecture notes. The p-sets definitely take a significant amount of time, but with good time management they're not impossible. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how available the professor and teaching assistants were to answer questions. The teaching staff was always helpful and willing to explain concepts that were confusing, which really goes a long way in a class this large! ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very application based, grading is generous so even though tests wreck you theres a curve\r\nweaknesses: wayyyyyy harder than your average intro physics class ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Psets are (usually) a good opportunity to engage with the material and grasp it better. The tests were pretty fair but required a lot of studying. It's great that we get test corrections or else everyone would get B's. Lecture notes are SUPER helpful!\r\nWeaknesses: takes a TON of time (like 8 hours for psets, 3 hours for class per week), honestly think I would have been better off not going to lecture and just reading lecture notes ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing, and there are so many hours that people are available to help for the class. \r\n\r\nThe psets were long, but this was sometimes important for understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Professor has very strong teaching abilities. Weaknesses: lack of accessible resources from office hours and study hall for students who are struggling. Since this class is a lecture, a discussion section would be helpful for clearing up questions on topics when they are first learned, rather than prolonging confusion and creating issues when studying for major exams. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very well taught. Professor Steinacker obviously cares about her students and she puts in a lot of work into crafting the lectures. The class is supremely well organized. All the lecture notes are posted online, so skipping class is not the end of the world. ",
            "\u00a0The level of support given by office hours/study hall was definitely the strongest attribute of the course, in addition to Professor Steinacker herself of course. Probably the part of the class I struggled with the most was the difficulty on the psets, since they were difficult to start on one's own, but at least they made up a significant portion of the grading so the work put in pays off. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are ridiculously hard, although there is a lot of help available. Lecture did not match the difficulty of the homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well taught, homework is related to material, course materials (lecture notes, homework, etc.) are very organized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many students in the class have literally taken courses with this material and so they get it immediately. For those of us that do not have strong physics background it often it seems like we move on too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not very well organized, as Professor Steinacker is often unclear about what direction she is planning to take or what concept she is about to teach us next. I never had the chance to take physics at any level in high school, so it was frustrating having an \"introductory\" level course that was this difficult and confusing. It would be better if the course covered simpler examples first and had somewhat easier problem sets so that students could actually start the problems by themselves rather than needing help from peer tutors and other students for every problem in every problem set. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that this class will certainly teach you more about physics and how to solve problems in physics. One weakness is that oftentimes the professor's lectures are hard to follow and I remember some classes where we spent the entire class deriving out a physics formula but then we never had to use that derivation again. I'm sure that she intended for this derivation to give us a deeper understanding of the formula's, but personally, I never found that knowledge useful for the class. Also, sometimes her lectures can be disjointed and for some lectures, I found reading her lecture notes much easier to follow than actually listening during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not well organized. The lectures were confusing and the concepts weren't well explained, and the homework was always too difficult and hard to understand. It would take me at least 5 minutes to even understand a question. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not always the strongest in terms of giving information to students. The lectures focus on proving the formulas we use in class, but dont focus more on how to apply those formulas in a large variety of problems. Still, the course was fantastic at promoting critical thinking and deep understanding of physics ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: I wish study hall had even more peer tutors and a larger room. At times, it was frustrating to have to wait for so long to get help\r\nStrengths: Prof Steinacker and her online notes. Her online notes are so thorough and easy to follow. Even though I attended every lecture, I still didn't really understand concepts until I read through her class notes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the number of office hours that are available to students. This course is also very well-organized and the homework prepares you well for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Steinacker is a nice person.  However her approach to teaching physics is downright stupid.  She provides endless, error-ridden derivations in class instead of introducing material in a big-picture sense and then working through practice problems.  Thus, coming to class is basically a waste of time.  The problem sets, which take 10-12 hours, focus little on the physics components and instead on random algebra tricks which few people come up with on their own.  Study hall is a stressful affair with 100 people crammed into her little office, and while the peer tutors are great, the TAs are largely useless and disconnected with the structure of the course and thus can't provide much guidance on problem sets.  This ends up being ok, as most (READ: MOST) people copy the problem sets after one person has done the due diligence of acting getting the answers from the TA early on.  A better system would be have 10 easy problems and 2 hard problems on the problem sets so people can actually focus on learning physics instead of grubbing for answers to finish the stupid problem sets.  The exams are too easy and curved too strongly (you gotta set more of a curve after giving everyone 100% on plagiarized homework), not providing enough of a boost for people who actually excel when it comes to the exams.  Steinacker definitely has potential as a physics instructor as she is clearly intelligent and cares about her students.  But not much about this course works, and she needs to recognize it ",
            "\u00a0Boring ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Professor Steinacker holds numerous three-hour long study halls every day for students to ask questions/work on p-sets together.\r\n- The grading of homework and exams is incredibly fair and rewarding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Material moves to quickly and there are not enough straightforward examples done in lecture. As a result p-sets are nearly impossible to do without guidance.\r\nP-sets focus more on deriving equations than actually applying the concepts learned to traditional physics problems ",
            "\u00a0The course does not have a lot of room for one on one learning but there were many peer tutors and teaching fellows to help with that. The course material was difficult and it moved quickly but was effective in teaching individual problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0I know I am not the first person to say this but the p-sets are so painstakingly long. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is the number of great resources to help students learn the material. Professor Steinacker posts notes for every single lecture, as well as review session, that are very detailed and explain both the concepts and the ways to solve different types of problems well. There are also study hall hours Sunday through Thursday for 2-3 hours a night where students can get together and work on the weekly problem sets with TAs and peer tutors available to help. Additionally, many of the peer tutors hold office hours outside of study hall in order to help with the psets, and Professor Steinacker has office hours for several hours throughout the week to help with concepts and problems on the psets as well. One of the weaknesses of this course is how much work goes into every pset and the class in general; this class is a large time commitment every single week with no break. However, I do think that I, personally, have been able to establish a decent foundation for the material and learn the concepts well because of the depth of the problems on the psets, even if they take a long time. I will say though that physics was consistently the class to which I committed the most time, stress, and energy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing instructor; challenging but manageable; well organized\r\nWeaknesses: large class ",
            "\u00a0Adrianne is lovely and is great at explaining the theory in class, however I found it very difficult to follow her working through examples on the board - I tend to just zone out and stare at numbers and calculations for most of the class. I wish I could just stay for the theory part of the class and leave once she starts doing examples, as they are posted online and its much easier for me to work through them on my own rather than stare blindly at a board for 75mins. ",
            "\u00a0PSets that aren't as extremely difficult and long. Maybe if we learned how to do the problems in class instead of learning how to do one or two problems that are unrelated. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is an excellent teacher and makes sure to go through very thorough explanations of the physical concepts in class. Due to the class size, however, individual confusion cannot be resolved on the spot. As such, the course is set up to encourage group learning outside of the class time, especially when completing the weekly problem sets. You will learn the concepts in class, but do not expect class time to fully prepare you for the homework assignments. Most of the learning is done outside of class, with other students, throughout the week working on these problem sets. Its an excellent way to learn, but does take up a significant amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately I didn't take advantage of this until almost the end of the semester, but a huge strength of the course if Steinacker's office hours. She devotes so much time to helping students through psets, it's incredible. Definitely go if you're stuck, and don't struggle through it mostly alone like I did! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is a fantastic teacher, and she is very understanding and considerate. The class was run very smoothly and I really have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0it is difficult to hear from the back seats ",
            "\u00a0The office hours are very helpful. The weekly psets are very long and time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very standard stuff, but the class itself is not very organized. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of resources if you are struggling, but basically everyone struggles with the problem sets because they are different than what is taught in lecture sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - passionate teacher, good at teaching\r\nWeaknesses - large class size leads to lack of engagement, at times problems on psets did not match up with content taught ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course are the office hours available throughout the week. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this class is that during class, we are not really taught the concepts. Instead, the professor just immediately starts doing problems on the board without fully explaining the concepts behind what she is doing. This makes it very hard to follow what she is doing on the boards. And then we are just expected to learn through the problem sets and memorize those problems instead of understanding for the tests. She needs to learn a new way of teaching that is more effective for physics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of supplementary material given to prepare for tests and homework \r\nWeaknesses: pset difficulty was through the roof\r\nImprovements: I would suggest video taping classes to later post on canvas. Lectures were very good and very helpful, but seeing it once is not enough to understand the material. Office hours are also helpful, but a video of the class would be great for independent studying and learning. ",
            "\u00a0I think that more time could be spent on examples versus derivations. However, I think the challenging psets helped me learn the most. I felt very proud to complete them and knew that I would be able to face the test having understood them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are it challenges you, but there is SO much support for you, from peer tutor hours, TA study hall, to Adrianes own almost DAILY office hours hosted with brilliant peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0The accessibility to help - be it from peer tutors, TAs, or Steinacker herself during office hours - was a great strength of this course. The course organization was also very well done, with comprehensive lecture notes and concise review sessions to help structure concept review for homework and exams.\r\n\r\n Sometimes the questions on the problem sets were written such that the set-up could be interpreted in several different ways, with only one interpretation leading to the correct answer (e.g. the umbrella question), so for these cases it was necessary to consult with TAs, Steinacker, or peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fostered for the learning of physics. We were given many opportunities to get help and understand what we needed to now for the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there are many opportunities to get help on homework, and that the course is very organized and straight forward. Potential weaknesses are that sometimes the material can get a little confusing if the students are not familiar with the material beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Steinacker explains everything at the speed of light and skips a million steps, assuming previous physics knowledge even though this is an intro class. ",
            "\u00a0None. Course was great ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor, the abundance of office hours and peer tutors, the fact that problem sets are completed and submitted by hand, the way the problem sets count for a pretty large portion of the grade allows us to get out what we put in.\r\n\r\nWeakness: One or two too many problems on the problem set that can make it rushed. If there was one less problem on each pset it would be less rushed and office hours would be more effective.  Also having office hours on Friday during the day could be nice since most people don't have class and may want last minute help.  Often the wording of questions is ambiguous or confusing...I'm not sure how to improve this, but it's a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not entirely sure how to answer this. Physics is hard, yes, but this class is really hard. But test corrections buffer your grade even if you literally flunk the exam, your homework average is almost a guaranteed A if you go to office hours and/or study all, and that's on top of a generous curve to keep you from failing that class. So... the difficulty of the course is the weakness, but then the grade inflation makes up for it... ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are how hard the teacher is willing to work and the extra help she provides. There are some weakness such as the workload, but this is expected. Her lectures are also sometimes confusing but that may be a fact of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a strong sense of community derived from the hours spent at office hours\r\nWeaknesses: the problem sets were nearly impossible to do on one's own, and 9 times out of 10 one required help from the peer tutors in office hours ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course. I thought the lectures were great, the P-sets were well designed to facilitate learning, and office hours were incredibly helpful. That said, if there was any way to learn the material with slightly less banging-one's-head-on-the-desk-in-desperation, it would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The course started out great but a the semester continued there seemed to be very little organization of the classes. It made it difficult to take notes that were anything more than just copying down derivations and hoping it made sense at the end of class. The resources for the class are absolutely wonderful. Study halls ever night were really helpful in motivating students to really work on the coursework and interact with their classmates to solve problems. However, these resources are absolutely necessary since some of the problem sets were unreasonably difficult. I understand adding some more complex problems here and there or having problems build on each other, but it almost got to the point where it seemed like I could only work through the problem once a teaching fellow gave me several hints as to how approach it and even then some problems required more help.  Though I will say I loved the test corrections. The idea is so wonderful because it shows that the purpose of evaluations like exams is not to pointing out failures of where students didn't fully grasp the material, but instead to address areas where improvement can be made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the examples used in class and the study session availability, but I feel as though the psets were overly tough along with the tests. "

Her psets take a long time, so I would recommend getting started on them early, even if you do a few problems at a time. With all of the resources available, it is a manageable course if you make sure to try to stay on top of the material. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of work, and will most likely be your most demanding course as psets can easily take 8+ hours a week to complete. That being said, working through an entire pset is really rewarding and Steinacker's office hours are the best. I really feel like I've gotten a lot out of this class. I didn't take physics in high school so there was a bit of a learning curve, but my ability to think through and solve word problems has benefitted a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend PHYS 180 only if the student has had prior preparation in physics and if the student was decent, but not entirely confident, in their math abilities. Otherwise I would recommend PHYS 200, especially for those with an interest in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! If you're pre-med especially. And if you've had AP Physics already. This is really not a simple \"introduction to physics\". It is the next level. ",
            "\u00a0It's not a class to be taken casually, but I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I only took it as a pre-req but ended up looking forward to class every day. The p-sets are difficult but rewarding, as is the sense of accomplishment when you do better on the second midterm, as most of the class does. ",
            "\u00a0Not really unless you love physics. Steinaker is very nice and maybe her teaching style works for some people, but it didn't work for me. She mostly just works through problems during class, and even though I tried very hard, I couldn't understand her explanations and got really disengaged from the lectures. The peer tutors aren't much help either, so it's hard to get help. It's a super hard course, so for the majority of the class who are premed and not physics majors its kind of silly. If you love physics then you might enjoy the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it's pretty good. I didn't take physics in high school at all so I was freaking out in the beginning of the year, but it eventually became manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they were interested in STEM. If so, I think it is a great class for learning the fundamentals and it is very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was more of a class on solving extremely difficult problems with Newtonian physics than an introduction to physics concepts. The lectures can have a lot of tangents that may be confusing and the PSETS took a lot of time in office hours and study hall but the grading of the class and exams is fair and Professor Steinacker is very sweet. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although this course was especially rigorous and challenging, I enjoyed the overall experience. ",
            "\u00a0I do not recommend unless you need to take it as a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, partly because it really improves my analytical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0It's probably a requirement for your major/pre-med, but I would definitely recommend Steinacker over Phys 170. If you put in the work, you'll do well in this class. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have a true passion for physics or problem solving. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if you have previous physics experience and/ or have to take this course for your major. From what I have heard, if you are able to take 170 instead you are better off in terms of having a manageable introductory class, and, if you are able to take 120 instead, the concepts and topics will be harder, but the problem sets won't be as crazy as those in 180. I do feel like I learned a lot in this course, but I did so on my own more than actually learning through the help of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in getting more practice with physics problems and learning how to solve them. It is somewhat similar to AP Physics 1 but goes into more detail in certain topics and also goes much faster. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Steinacker is a great teacher that makes you question and appreciate the world around you ",
            "\u00a0No, not really. If you want to study physics, take Physics 200/260. This course is mostly premeds and isn't that well taught. ",
            "\u00a0This is the hardest class I have taken at Yale. If you can get through it, you will of course I learned a lot of physics, but more importantly, you will gain a lot of confidence. After taking this class, I feel like I can tackle almost any other Yale course. \r\n\r\nPsets took ~15 hrs, which I was NOT used to (although I suppose by the end of the course, I got more used to the time required to complete each pset). Physics office hours are honestly like a fifth class, but Steinacker and the other undergrad TAs are better than the grad students at the nighttime study halls. I would definitely recommend finding friends you can work on the psets with. Also, start the pset early, because study hall is less crowded in the beginning of the week.\r\n\r\nIf you're taking this with physio...you're in for a tough semester (although you won't be alone bc there are tons of BME kids who will be on the same struggle bus). If at all possible, I would not take physics and physio at the same time. \r\n\r\n2 tips to do well on the exams:\r\n1. Go through her class notes thoroughly before each midterm. Her exam questions are often based on in-class examples. \r\n2. Re-do the psets for practice (with the exception of the proof-based questions, which generally aren't tested on). \r\nI cannot emphasize these 2 things enough. I did terribly on the first midterm because I did not do these two things. I did much better on the 2nd midterm by doing the above. The final is basically a 3rd midterm on the last section of the class (not very cumulative) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Probably not.  Problem sets are too difficult to spend time understanding the material.  I have heard good things about the 200 sequence; if you think you can deal with the harder exams etc.  I would say take that ",
            "\u00a0Physics 180 is definitely the way to go for intro physics. Professor Steinacker is unbelievably dedicated to teaching (so much so that she holds office hours every day of the week) and truly tries to make sure that her students succeed. The material is presented clearly and effectively in class, but she also posts extremely detailed lecture notes online if you miss class or do not understand everything the first time around. Relative to friends in 170 and even 200, our problem sets were much longer and significantly harder, but they more than prepared us for the exams. As long as you work on them with others (which is really easy to do considering the amount of office hours and study halls this class has), you will be able to get through them in a reasonable amount of time and will be much better off in the course for having done them. ",
            "\u00a0I mean u kinda have to take it, its dry but the professor is real cool ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because there was an incredible amount of information in it but the work load was very intense. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students that need to fulfill a physics requirement IF Professor Steinacker is teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the instructor is passionate about this class and makes learning the material extremely rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. If my major didn't require it I wouldn't come close. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would. Its a great introduction to physics, and finishing the class feels very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It draws on important concepts of calculus and is challenging in a rewarding manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is very kind and understanding. Her lectures are very interesting and helpful. Office hours are very helpful. You learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of content, this class is very standard - it covers introductory physics concepts using calculus. Furthermore, Professor Steinacker is fairly nice. Despite this however, she's very inflexible - if you don't submit your test corrections in the right format, she will not accept them at all. This is kind of ironic, considering how sloppy the course material is sometimes... Answer keys are often illegible or even incorrect. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but just know that the psets take up a lot of your time during the week (especially if you haven't taken physics before or don't have a solid physics background), so plan accordingly. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student. She is not a good teacher and the problem sets are extremely long. We do so much work and it doesn't seem like we really learn it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really like that one had to remain persistent through the psets and liked the professor very much. However, the class is quite a large time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its definitely manageable. Not overwhelming and very enjoyable. It helps to be quantitatively-minded but there is so so much support and solidarity among students and from loads of peer tutors, tas, and the phenomenal Adriane Steinacker ",
            "\u00a0Chances are youre deciding between this and 170. If your course schedule/load allows for spending 8++ hours weekly on the homework (bonus if you checked and are available to go to office hours, for which 30 minutes was equivalent to roughly 1hour of progress in study hall or 2 hours alone), and if you are interested in learning physics at the depth taught in this course, I recommend it. The professor knows her stuff, but also had fairly high expectations of her students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was difficult but I feel the knowledge I gained was very practical and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, especially taught by Prof Steinacker to students who need/want to take a physics course. It is very enjoyable if you have an interest in physics and you definitely develop a good understanding of fundamental concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Do it if you need to ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be aware that it is absolutely expected that you to go at least a few hours of office hours a week for help on problem sets. It's a very time intensive course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a great class and the professor cares about how her students do. She wants you to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  Even as someone who was not particularly interested in physics, professor Steinacker's enthusiasm and joy for physics is absolutely contagious.  The course is challenging, but rewarding and structured for students success.  Of all the intro STEM classes I've taken (bio, chem, math 120), this is BY FAR the most personal one and the one that is most set up for student learning and success. ",
            "\u00a0Umm... well, most people take this class because they have to. Premeds could do 170, but it doesn't always fit on their schedules and they end up taking this. Some people could possibly do 200, but no one can really testify if 200 really is harder than 180 (trust me, we debate about this a lot in office hours/study hall; really ask around if you're unsure). But I would like to point out that I personally DID NOT need to take the course for any reason. I merely wanted to try out physics since I've had some amateur interest in optics and astronomy. If you are for some reason in a similar position, then I would NOT recommend this course. You'd be better off just taking a level-100 astronomy course. I worked 8+ hours a week on every pset, which was absolutely exhausting. I lot of times I couldn't really get a TA/Peer Tutor/Steinacker/someone who's done with the problem you're on/Google to help me out. You'll make some friends at least, since all anyone talks about is how they have no clue what's going on. And this is very algebra heavy stuff, so if you're just interesting in the concepts or history, then this really is not the right class for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if its a requirement. The class is really dense and difficult and theres no need to take it unless youre genuinely curious or required. ",
            "\u00a0One needs a strong understanding of calculus and be able to visualize topics with ease in order to do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the lectures are enjoyable and the coursework is challenging, but intellectually engaging and rewarding if you can allot enough time for them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Adriane Steinaker as a professor. It introduced me to calculus-based physics in an engaging way and made me competent in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I believe that the coursework is unnecessarily difficult and does not make me feel like I learned the material any better. The lectures became frustrating because I had little idea of where it was headed or what i was supposed to be getting out of the problems being worked out on the board. I think there must be a better way to learn physics than by just watching someone solve a bunch of problems. ",
