It helped me grow a greater understanding of human rights and the purpose of their enforcement. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking and analyzing, to appreciate and understand different points of views. I alao learned a lot of many countries in the world, I know and understand the human rights very well, I know about the UPR in many countries, I learned about human rights watch and other non-profit organizations. I learned so much from this class, specially to be empathic. ",
            "\u00a0I have always been fascinated by politics and human rights and yet as a high school student I never had the chance to study human rights or politics systematically. This course was definitely the key led me to the field of political science. I was able to evaluate human rights base on the international laws and treaties. In addition, I always learnt the historical development of human rights and also the meaning of some philosophical terms such as human dignity. Before this course, human rights to me were only an abstract concept. Now however, I start to see it was one of the most important obligations the politicians need to meet. And with the knowledges I learnt from the class, I shall aim one day, to be able to assist the development of human rights performance on a global scale. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught how to analyze the legal framework for human rights globally. I learned about the human rights based approach, I learned the true meaning of public policy, moreover, I've learned the core principles of human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my knowledge about international bodies and how the international framework and domestic governance interact to guarantee human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to evaluate issue using the human rights approach. I also got to learn so much official declarations that lays the foundation for all human rights issues. Arm with these knowledge mostly learn in the first three weeks, I got to evaluate the UPR of my own country and present it to the class, which is a really valuable experience. "

            "\u00a0The trip to Human Right Watch is quite impressive. The presentation on UPR in respective countries of students in class help them learn more about the Human Right situation in their own country and worldwide. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Very intuitive\r\n-good reading material\r\n- the professor has very deep knowledge on the topics discussed\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Hard to understand the assignments and their purpose ",
            "\u00a0There is so much information just to fit in 5 weeks, but overall, the course was amazing ",
            "\u00a0The course was very insightful, it helps those who have never touched on the area of human rights end up, feeling they are ready to become a human right defender. During the process of preparing for presentation and my final policy memo, I felt I have learnt more that what I delivered. \r\nThe knowledge we learnt in the class can perhaps be, more detailed. The amount of information was so immense that it was hard for the students to dig further into each areas of learning. \r\nAlso more class discussion would be great. ",
            "\u00a0I am satisfied with how the course was taught. The visit at Human Rights Watch was really meaningful. The professor encouraged the students to engage into civil debates with the aim of observing how people from different parts of the world interpret human rights. The UPR presentations were really useful. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that it consists of several guest visits and one fruitful field trip, which helped me to understand the real implementation of HR. The weakness is that the actual class agenda is inconsistent with the syllabus, so the preview is sometimes confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength are included in what I learned. Another strength I want to include is the various backgrounds of each students and how that contribute to class discussions. \r\nThe class can possibly be improved if reading questions are provided in the beginning. These can be not for answering but for guiding us through the reading because it is hard to process when we were first reading it. "

It's a really valuable experience. "
