            "\u00a0I developed a solid understanding of multivariable calculus, vector calculus, and 3D geometry. ",
            "\u00a0Developed knowledge of several concepts in multi variable calculus and problem solving strategies for these types of problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned multi variable calculus, and many different types of integrals. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of a lot of integrals and critical problem solving. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a variety of different kinds of integrals (single, double, line, surface/flux) to solve 3D calculus problems as well as different techniques to use when you don't want to solve directly (FTLI, Green's, Stoke's, Divergence Theorem). The beginning of the course covered vectors, lines and planes in space, as well as differentiation methods (gradient, directional derivatives) and methods for optimization (setting the gradient equal to 0, lagrange multipliers). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The homework really desperately needs to be reworked. The assignments are long, monotonous, and tangentially helpful at best. Most of the problems are just long trig substitutions or equally obnoxious wastes of time. Also, the grading of homework is unnecessarily harsh and vindictive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Small class sizes are ideal for a math course since it gives you the opportunity to engage with professor and other students. Developing a relation with a peer tutor (Calvin) was by far the greatest action I took this semester to seek help in this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I don't like group work - I think this could be removed; all instructors should give a handout of the lecture they are giving; professors should give students a more concrete method to approach harder topics like Stokes Thm, Div Thm, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course is poorly structured in my opinion. Although the course was fast-paced and meets 3 days a week, I believed that it would be helpful if we could have the class for longer period of times. Once a topic was taught, we would only perform one example and that was it. I don't believe there was enough exposure to the concept that we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- reasonable workload and material isnt impossible to understand \r\nWeaknesses- the level of knowledge and teaching skill between the instructors is pretty widely different, the problem sets count for very little of your grade and midterms and final can be rough, difficult to come back after one bad test since there are only two and the final. Need to work independently outside of class to do well ",
            "\u00a0The course offered many resources and avenues to review and reinforce material. However, the class itself was not well taught and many of the concepts were difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Coming from AB and BC calculus and generally liking math, I felt like this course was the right amount of challenge, and a good introduction to new notations that are probably used in other math courses. I liked my instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had the 3 per week 50 minute setup and it felt a little rushed, an hour time slot three times a week would have been better. Maybe a little more time should be spent on having multiple methods of figuring out how to bound surfaces and domains. Some homework problems required obscure trig identities, and that was a little frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the variety of topics being taught and discussed. Weaknesses include how quickly the material is taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There a lot of review sessions you can go to! The teachers do cover all of the material that is being assessed. This math course is a prereq for a lot of math/stem majors. The homework provides practice of the topics covered each week. Sufficient time is allowed for each topic, but you probably should review on your own time as well. More than enough practice material is provided. There are multiple practice exams for both midterms and the final, as well as practice problems on Ximera. Teachers are readily available during office hours to answer questions.\r\nWeaknesses: 3D calculus can be tricky, and the problem sets are time-consuming. There aren't that many problems but they are each tedious and there are countless places that you can make errors in your calculations. Some of the homework problems require integration techniques that I either did not learn when I took Calc 1 and 2, or forgot (double angle theorem, integral of cos^2(x)). Some of the teachers are better than others, and your teacher can really make a difference in how well you understand the material. The pace of the class is pretty fast. Multivariable Calculus at Yale is more difficult than at many other institutions. Other schools may teach all the same material, but the exams might be easier. For example, in addition to having to know all the formulas and theorems, here you are also assessed on knowing when to use each one, and choosing the ones which will make your life easiest to use. You choose how you solve the problems on the exams, and there may be multiple ways to solve the same problem, but you have to decide which is easiest because the exams are timed. At other schools, you may not have to choose, and they may tell you which method to use, which is much more straightforward. This class is completely stripped of context, which may be a strength or a weakness, depending on how you see it. It is pure math, and the course doesn't touch the physics or applications of the calculus. "

            "\u00a0I would, provided that the student is willing to seek help when he or she does not understand the concept completely. ",
            "\u00a0Most people who is taking Math 120 has already taken calculus 3. I think the class would be helpful for someone who has already taken calculus 3. However, if you are coming from calculus 2, I would rather spend the time self-studying than going to class. ",
            "\u00a0Probably a requirement, but Id say it isnt as absolutely horrible as many make it out to be (though it definitely can be) ",
            "\u00a0The quality of the course depends a lot on the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Review your notes and do at least some homework with others. Some say the latter half of the course is not that useful, but I liked it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only if the person is a math major or genuinely interested in multivariate calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for most students, you kind of have to take this class. In my opinion, 115 would be harder because if covers series, which I personally find more difficult. If you took multivariable calc (calc 3) in high school, the first half of this class is pretty much a review. Regardless, I still found it challenging. You are most likely to succeed in math 120 if you took multivariable in high school and therefore have some amount of familiarity with the topics, or if you took math 115 at Yale so you know how math classes at Yale operate. Definitely give this class a shot, and if it seems too rigorous you can always move down to a lower level. At the end of the day, it is a high-level math class, and everyone struggles with it, but I think it is not unmanageable, and you can succeed in this class, especially if you have a group of friends who are also in this class to do the problem sets with.
