It was also very helpful to get feedback on our proposals from the instructor and our peers. \r\n\r\nLess time could be allotted to reading about the various components of a proposal. Most of all, I wish we had done an annotated bibliography or some kind of formal literature review assignment before we started writing our proposals. ",

It also highlights what strengthens and weakens your proposal. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The first few lectures did not hold much meaning to me for proposal writing. I would have rather used that time to learn how to develop my own ideas. Also, the final presentation would have been more helpful if we did it before turning in our proposals. Finally, most examples of papers in this class were ecology based, which does not connect to all students. ",

I also appreciated the timely feedback we received. The main thing I would improve is the system for peer review and feedback--I felt that we were often reviewing and being reviewed by students so far outside our own fields that their insights were not very helpful.
