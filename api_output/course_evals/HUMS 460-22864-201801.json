            "\u00a0I learned a lot about intellectual engagement with a single place, American history and music, the way media portrays disasters and other difficult topics, and more  I feel like my skill set and knowledge went far beyond simply New Orleans, and extended to a deeper understanding of literature, race relations in America, womanhood, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to center inquiry on one city. We practiced linking disparate types of material into a single inquiry. I learned to question the perspective and source and intended and unintended work different sources do for certain arguments or ways of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach a city study from a variety of angles, and how to bring diverse sources together to develop a more holistic understanding of a place. I was inspired to pursue unconventional archives in my own research. ",
            "\u00a0I now have a much better understanding of the history and politics of New Orleans, as well as a richer appreciation of place-based exploration. I felt like my ability to write in an academic but accessible style also improved. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a really holistic understanding of New Orleans and its history. I loved how this course incorporated a really diverse range of perspectives on the city so that the knowledge I gained wasn't one-sided. The course also didn't pretend to have easy answers about the city or about any of the issues we tackled. Pretending that there are clear answers about New Orleans' culture, history, racial divides, or Hurricane Katrina wouldn't be productive at all. Embracing the messiness of the city and its history was sometimes frustrating but ultimately I think as close to the truth as we could get. This course contributed to my growing acceptance of the complicated and often unclear nature of urban studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about the city of New Orleans and its broader role in the United States. By studying the intricacies of a single city, I learned an enormous amount about urban development, about racial tensions and gentrification, and about the role that colonization and slavery have played in the making of America. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible class that taught us about the intersecting/overlapping/intertwined histories, narratives, lives, maps and identities of New Orleans and New Orleanians. ",
            "\u00a0Feel like I learned a lot about positionally and also making use of a variety of types of sources. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about New Orleans and a little about jazz, food, man made/natural disasters, racist policing, etc ",
            "\u00a0I got a multidisciplinary introduction to New Orleans, and learned a number of modes of examining place. ",
            "\u00a0Great class!!! I learned a lot about New Orleans and interdisciplinary scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0I LEARNED SO MUCH! I learned about the history and culture of New Orleans. I learned to question/doubt the \"single story\" narrative. I learned to appreciate mental mapping. I learned about contradictions and dynamics. I learned to think deeply about the ethics and politics of urban policy. I learned how to scrutinize sources and think critically about the intended audiences of various types of media and materials. I enjoyed thinking about authenticity, truth-seeking, nostalgia, and the links between the past, present, and future of a place. I enjoyed discussing collective/personal memory, the relationship between active (and passive) forgetting and remembering, and joy (expressions of joy) as subversion. "

            "\u00a0The workload was high and I felt like the course was almost entirely focused on race relations, which are obviously crucial to understanding New Orleans and talking about it, but I did feel like it overwhelmed the class's content at times. The strengths were its exceptional instruction, engaging multi-media content, and well-balanced workload. I LOVED the course's use of atlases, TV shows, music, and fiction in a edition to academic literature. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: we looked at so many different types of material and that was excellent! Both professors brought wonderful perspective and methods of questioning to this class. I also appreciated the interaction with the guest lecturers.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I often felt like I wasn't sure what the goal or the thesis of the class was. I wish I had understood better where the professors were trying to go with this or what some of the overall takeaways were supposed to be. I also struggled a bit with the level of thinking/writing expected of us in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is amazing and lends itself to great discussions. I know some students voiced concerns about the reading load, but I didn't feel it was overwhelming and wouldn't cut much at all. I wasn't as much a fan of one aspect of the final assignment. Going in, I thought creating a map would be a fun departure from normal writing assignments, but when it came down to actually making it, I was annoyed by the map and just wanted to write the essay. I would have loved to reach some of the professors' relevant work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- great readings and other texts, dynamic and engaging professors, great topic, awesome other seminar mates. Lots of out-of-class engagement with professors and fellow students. Really just a fun experience! \r\nWeaknesses--A more explicit articulation of the themes and key frameworks that each seminar session should teach us would have helped structure the class more. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly loved almost every aspect of this course. It was not perfect, but it was a great learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that was difficult for me was getting through all of the reading. I would have loved to have done every bit of it, but sometimes it just wasn't realistic considering my workload for other courses. ",
            "\u00a0A great class! Awesome professor and wonderful classmates were its biggest strengths, but the syllabus was dope too. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great topic, attracted an awesome group of students, fantastic teachers. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings were very overwhelming in the first part of the semester (after which they were toned down a little). The evenings when the guests came were just so long (5+ hours of engagement) and I felt really drained after each one. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was really interesting, but I think I would have been more engaged if we had more writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Joe and Crystal were wonderful. The class itself was a bit all over the place and an ok seminar, occasionally really interesting and often not really moving anywhere. Guests were awesome. ",
            "\u00a0The interdisciplinary approach is good because it allows students to think about New Orleans in a variety of ways, which can often be very illuminating. However, the interdisciplinary approach also meant the class did not feel very coherent. The topics jumped around a lot from week to week, and that made it sometimes difficult to really feel like we could go in depth into anything. If the course is taught again I would suggest focusing on a specific theme, or somehow design the syllabus so that the weeks and topics build on each other more. Also there was far too much reading at the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Great reading, great class discussion, great professors! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! Without a doubt, this is one of the best courses I've ever taken at Yale. I learned so much from the readings, the lectures, Professor Feimster, Professor Fischel, and other students in the class. I enjoyed our class discussions! We approached the class material from so many angles (primary sources, poetry books, speakers, TV shows, documentaries, academic articles, etcetera), which I appreciated. I especially enjoyed the atlas of New Orleans (Unfathomable City); it was AMAZING. I'm in love, and I plan to purchase other atlases by Rebecca Solnit. The Facebook group was a wonderful aspect of the class; I really enjoyed reading the thoughts/opinions of my classmates. It was an immersive course (we even ate New Orleanian food--which was absolutely delicious), but we constantly (and properly) recognized and discussed the limits of our understanding. I would say that the final project was probably one of the most challenging and rewarding assignments I've ever had at Yale. Many of us had never used ArcGIS before, and learning how to use the program (for me, at least) wasn't very intuitive. However, the lack of strict guidelines did allow for greater agency/control over our projects. Honestly, I'm having trouble finding anything negative about this class...the length of the readings, I guess. Some of them were definitely too long. "

            "\u00a0I really would! The chance to attend the seminars and dinners hosted by the Frankes is an unparalleled opportunity. Diving deep into a particular topic with two top-notch instructors is also fantastic. This course is an experience unique to Yale, and I would strongly encourage anyone to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think I would recommend this class to another student, with some caveats. I don't think I was ready to engage in it as much as I needed to be. I'd recommend it to someone confident in their ability to speak up in seminars even if it's not super clear what the direction of conversation is/should be. I would also recommend it to someone confident in their ability to pin down a few ideas and stick to them, and to a student who is comfortable with last minute changes (which I didn't think distracted from the course). ",
            "\u00a0I would. The guest lectures were fascinating, the syllabus was stellar, and the professors were invested and creative in the discussions they led. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really fun and interesting readings and discussion, and excellent professors. Wonderful experience, especially if you are taking a few more practical, applied courses at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Professors Feimster and Fischel are amazing and although the class was ambitious, it successfully covered a broad range of academic materials. Cool projects, great discussions, and amazing lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was such an interactive course and I was so engaged with the content and the work and my classmates. I felt like it was incredibly relevant to me, my life, and my future work. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! It was a one-time offer, so I can unfortunately not recommend it to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! But unfortunately its probably not going to be taught again. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't love this class, but a lot of people in my class did. If you don't have the time to dedicate to this class (lots of readings, weekly TV shows, 5+ hr guest talks), don't take the class because you won't be able to get much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0A good course if you're just looking to expand your horizons and learn a lot about a city. Its crosslisting in WGSS feels a little tangential if that's what you're looking for, but overall it's a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking classes with these two incredible profs and would also recommend taking a WHC seminar because its super cool to be able to meet all these awesome people. Not sure I would recommend this particular class to anyone who doesnt have a special interest in NOLA. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a multidisciplinary look at New Orleans. The readings are usually interesting, and discussions are very good. It's also a very fun class, and the speakers were incredible. I would definitely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0YES Please teach it again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would certainly recommend this class to another student. I learned so much about myself, my classmates, and New Orleans (and also recognized the limits of my understanding). This is the kind of class that I've dreamed of taking, especially as someone interested in studying urban policy and planning. I think any students, regardless of academic background/interest, would benefit from taking this class. It asks students to revisit and challenge preconceived  notions about many subjects. It also asks students to be empathetic and open-minded. "
