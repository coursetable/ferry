            "\u00a0I learnt how to speak, write and read a lot of Chinese! I learnt how to write a large number of Chinese characters and also learnt how to have some basic conversations in Chinese ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to speak with proper tones, and write in pin yin and chinese characters with correct grammar. ",
            "\u00a0really good way to develop a working knowledge of elementary Chinese. The class is evenly split between reading writing speaking and listening so no skill is neglected ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak, read, and write Chinese at a basic introductory level. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn more about the Chinese culture and language. I was also able to speak more confidently in front of others through the oral presentations. ",
            "\u00a0This course advanced my proficiency in the Chinese language beyond anything that I had expected at the onset of the semester. I amassed information regarding the sentence structures and types, vocabulary, idiomatic phrases, and pronunciation that encompasses Mandarin Chinese. Initially, the grammatical structure of Chinese sentences was a little bit difficult to master as the placement of time phrases differs drastically from English. In Mandarin, the time phrase is placed in the beginning of the sentence, before the verb, as to contextualize the time tense of the sentence. However, as I practiced the sentence structure more often and perfected establishing the tense of the sentence at the beginning, I began to improve my speech. Additionally, I learned methods to understand and write Chinese characters efficiently. One extremely helpful method was to connect the meaning of the character in some way to its structure. For instance, for the character, \"Shangwang,\" which means to \"surf the internet,\" I found that part of the character looked like a fish net. This helped me to remember not just the meaning of the character but how to write it as well. As I became more versed in writing character I also began to see how different characters were composed of similar parts, which allowed me to further connect vocabulary words to one another and remember them more easily. My pronunciation of Chinese tones also improved tremendously, especially my pronunciation of words with different tones. One of the most useful insights that I developed during this course was in how to tailor my response to questions that I was asked. initially, I found it somewhat difficult to respond quickly to simple questions that I was asked in Chinese, because I would spend time searching through the multiple answers that I could respond with and constantly revise my response as I spoke it. Through the instruction of Shen Laoshi, I learned how to use the structure of the question I was asked to respond to someone's inquiry. This helped me increasingly respond completely and succinctly to questions I was asked. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that all the Chinese professors are extremely approachable and helpful. We have daily quizzes and homework and tough that is cumbersome, it is very helpful as we are forced to learn something everyday and not cram before our final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were good review of material everyday from previous chapters. Weaknesses were learning correct grammar, can be confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and the expectations for the class are very well laid out. ",
            "\u00a0no weaknesses, one of the best language classes I've had ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that there are only 10 students in my class, so the professor was able to pay attention to each one of us. ",
            "\u00a0The underlying strength of this course lies in its constant testing structure. The presence of daily quizzes not only served as a strong incentive to study the language , but also held me accountable. As a result my knowledge of vocabulary, grammatical structure, and characters increased rapidly. Another strength of the course was its interactive aspect. After learning or reviewing a grammar rule or concept we would practice using those rules in sentences in order to solidify our understanding of the concept as well as increase our flexibility of speech. I think a weakness of this course is its lack of emphasis on methods that can be used to recognize and remember how to write characters. I think that further exploration into this aspect of learning Chinese would make a huge impact in the advancement of students in their studies. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I am not sure about the other language courses at Yale, but the Chinese department is very well structured. You have to put in a fair amount of work in for this class, but it is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This is by far the best class Ive ever taken at Yale. This evaluation will just go into the sea of evaluations which tell you that the teachers are incredibly caring and passionate, the work is hard but gratifying, etc etc. I was extremely concerned about taking Chinese because of the work load. I really wanted to try learning chinese, but I thought it would be too hard. If youre on the fence about it, take it for sure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Chinese is extremely useful in communicating. Although it is difficult, it is very rewarding to be able to understand it. ",
            "\u00a0If a student wants to challenge themselves with a language then I recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, really sets you off well for learning Chinese ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Shen Laoshi does a great job of teaching at a quick but understandable pace. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the workload is not too high, not too low, and the general atmosphere of the class is very positive and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would without a doubt recommend this course to another student. For the student looking to learn how to speak Chinese at a conversational level, this course does much to prepare him or her how to adapt to different topics that they may encounter and provides a strong foundation for communicating questions, statements, and opinions. This course also helps to introduce students to the rich and vibrant aspects of Chinese culture and instills a deep interest in the customs and practices in China. At the least this course will help to expand your knowledge of different cultures around the world and will challenge you in new and exciting ways. "
