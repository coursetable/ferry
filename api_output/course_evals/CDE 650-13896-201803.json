            "\u00a0Overall I felt that this was a good course. I think the material covered was interesting. I think the structure of the class could be improved. The only checkpoint we had on the progress of our systematic review was the midterm. I think the course could have more check-in points where you physically have to hand something in so that you stay on top of everything. The process is complicated and I think being able to get feedback as you go would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The professor has a great background knowledge in Medicine. The project is not \"phishing\". The class is something real and useful. I do think we need more courses for advance meta-analysis such as network meta-analysis, meta-regression. ",
            "\u00a0Good course that teaches a really useful skill in research. Lectures are slightly unfocused and felt sometimes irrelevant to the process of writing a systematic review.  It would have been much more helpful if lectures and discussions were used as lab time to work on our systematic reviews. ",
            "\u00a0intro to evidenced based medicine is a misnomer - the class is about how to write a systematic review. It's an important skill and I learned a lot, but it was not what I was expecting. ",
            "\u00a0It's not a great course--the systematic review element should just be a small portion of the class rather than the focus of the entire thing. There are many other elements of evidence-based medicine that would have been useful to learn about as well. Also there are such varying levels of experience among the students that it is extremely difficult to have any type of meaningful discussion. ",

            "\u00a0AP- Strengths: My literature searching is much improved, I feel confident in assessing papers for bias, I feel confident that I could competently co-author a systematic review.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Personally I didn't find the material very exciting or engaging, having said that the skills I have learned will be very valuable additions to my Public Health toolbox.\r\n\r\nSometimes I did the homework stated in the syllabus for the Thursday session, but then it wasn't discussed so I felt my time was a bit wasted. I felt a lot of people in the class weren't that engaged with the material so the class atmosphere wasn't conducive to engaging class discussions. Maybe having a laptop free class would help, or at least have the Tuesday sessions laptop free. ",
            "\u00a0Systematic review and meta-analysis is a hot topic and definitely worth knowing. The course offers a chance to practice it. However, I feel like there are too many readings to be read. It might be better to have, say, one reading per week, as a practice for students to write a summary on their evaluation of biases and such. It doesn't need to be graded, but just having sth. completed might be better. ",

",

Attending the lectures was not always very useful, only for key lectures on specific parts of the systematic review process that we would have to carry out. This class would have been much more valuable if we had been constructing each part of our systematic review through the semester with feedback. This would have been a more effective use of our time and would have given us more structural direction. ",
