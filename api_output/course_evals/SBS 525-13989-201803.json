            "\u00a0This course was interesting but wasn't as engaging as I would have liked but is very laid-back. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided insight into the types of research people are doing that pertains to SBS. I do think having speakers who are in non-research positions would be helpful in giving us a sense of what we could do outside of academia.\r\nIn addition, I do think the schedule was a little confusing. I know it changed in the middle of the semester, but it was difficult to know which seminars were mandatory and which were optional. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated it. We had some wonderful speakers! The topics were always immensely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Eh. Nothing special. I wish there was more community building. It is more of a sit around, wait for the hour glass to run out and then bolt. It is nothing beyond that. There should also be some vetting of the talks... ",
            "\u00a0This course is really great it that it provided you with a lot of information about a wide variety of subjects. The speakers are all very interesting and really enjoyable to hear from. The one downside is that the schedule is very confusing, it changes a bunch and we had a mandatory session on a different day than we normally do, which makes it difficult to schedule things and make it to the seminar.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness is that we have this same food like all of the time. Some variety would be very appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0usually insightful, great healthy food options ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the diversity of speakers as well as the few sessions dedicated to feedback, the internship search, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The speakers this semester were interesting and I appreciated the range of topics (e.g. social networks, community-based projects, health in incarceration/re-entry) and the vastly improved lunch! ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course highlight work that would be relevant to students in the SBS department. It would be great to see more research that are in different fields to learn how we can intersect both at the research and policy level. ",
            "\u00a0Great Thursday seminar that was informative, relaxing, and offered lunch! ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. I enjoyed the presenters. However, there could have been more communication about class attendance requirements. There were also some date related snafus that hindered my ability to attend class. There was one day in which the date and day of the week did not match, and another week there were 2 sessions, but one was barely advertised and not on the original date list. It seems unfair to add a \"mandatory\" session like this. ",
            "\u00a0The food provided in the seminar was excellent. The guest lecturers were very interesting and I think the seminar would have benefited from having more guest lecturers throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings and topics were fascinating, but it was difficult to engage with the material to the level I would have liked in a class that big. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting speakers that presented on a wide variety of SBS subjects ",
            "\u00a0There was clearly careful planning of each seminar, which I appreciated. I also always appreciated the food. I think it would have been helpful to make the seminars 90 minutes instead because the speakers hardly ever left time for questions. Those last 5 minutes (because that's usually all that was left) did not feel conducive for engagement and so few students did and it just became a pattern. The topics that were covered were really interesting, especially the second half. I gained the most from seeing the decision-making process for each of their areas of study and the work they subsequently produced. ",
            "\u00a0As a second year, was only required to attend one session for the thesis which was helpful.  The brown bag lunches are also always a nice way to gauge how other students are feeling in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0good course, I'm glad we have a departmental seminar. Some of the calendars/emails conflicted on what was mandatory and what was not so I think clarifying that would be helpful. Really enjoyed the chili meals, not so much the quiche and kale salad :) I enjoyed the speakers who were brought in. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar was fantastic. I think it was a nice mix of people and issues all relating to the social and behavioral sciences. It shows the wide opportunities that this concentration provides. All of the speakers were great and engaging. As well, the lunch opportunities afterward are a great opportunity to meet people working in the field and ask more specific questions. ",
            "\u00a0The seminars were informative and informed, and the experts who were invited to lecture provided a thoughtful and insightful commentary to crucial topics in public health. ",
            "\u00a0I was always interested in the topic and I appreciate that the SBS department is so engaged. My only critique to please please please have some diversity with the food. The kale apple salad is good but not good enough to have everyday. I know a lot of people were grateful to get food but were upset it was the same every week. ",
            "\u00a0I rarely felt the level of interaction between colleagues in this seminar that I have in seminars I've taken in the past, which I think to a degree was due to esoteric subject matter addressed by each individual speaker. This course also often felt like checking a box off of a list of requirements. I wonder if allowing students to choose 5 seminars from any of our departments -- rather than strictly our own -- might lend itself to a more interdisciplinary public health approach and enable students to engage directly with material relevant to their professional and academic goals.\r\n\r\nI should also point out that scheduling was consistently problematic. We would often receive emails notifying us of a seminar that previously was not listed as \"required\" only for that stipulation to change at the last minute. I was frequently confused by expectations as to when we were and were not supposed to be attending seminars. "

It is a combination of lectures given by public health experts who focus on social and behavioral sciences and information sessions for SBS students regarding important matters within our curriculum such as the master's thesis. I would recommend this to another student, because it is an opportunity to learn new, interesting materials about public health that reinforce and add on to the concepts we cover in class. The weekly free lunch is also great! ",
