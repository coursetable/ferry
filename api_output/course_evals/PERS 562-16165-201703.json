            "\u00a0In this course, I got to practice advanced language skills like academic writing and idiomatic phrases and structures. However, it was so much more than a language course. As a class we got an in-depth survey of Persian-language cinema. The professor gave us a great selection of different types of movies (art-house vs mainstream), different genres and cultural backgrounds. It was great to see movies from Tajikistan and Afghanistan included as well as movies popular within Iran. Many courses only show us the art-house movies that win prizes at European festivals, but this course really goes beyond that narrow focus and tries to engage all different types of movies. ",
