            "\u00a0This class definitely encouraged me to be an attentive and intentional reader. Deconstructing tropes, norms, and writing styles in such a small class was really engaging! ",
            "\u00a0Reading and learning about sport through a literary lens was something I had never really done before, especially in any sort of academic way. Being to able to read, comprehend and discuss sports in this way was the biggest thing I learned from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about sports and to synthesize literature across authors. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful introduction to the world of sports writing, filled with engaging and beautifully-written texts. Opened my eyes to sports, cultures, and people I may never have engaged with otherwise. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Creswell is awesome at facilitating discussion in class, and nearly all the readings are engaging and fascinating. The creative assignments were fun, though they seemed a little random. That being said, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this course being small and personal the reading list was a big strength, but the course could be improved I think with more required written engagement with the texts. maybe short reading responses (or more reading questions) would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-structured, offering the opportunity for both academic and creative writing pieces. It also includes a wide array of texts, all of which are interesting and enjoyable. "

        [
            "\u00a0Great class! Definitely a different but fascinating way to read about sports, including sports you may not know that much about. The different types of readings really help differentiate the readings and keep them interesting throughout the semester. Prof. Creswell is great at organizing and driving discussion. Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0absolutely! I had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in sports, good writing, interesting people, or all of the above, this is a wonderful course. The readings are so interesting that they don't feel like work, and the essays are enjoyable. "
