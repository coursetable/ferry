            "\u00a0Barbara's emphasis on both abstract theoretical and more concrete interpretive and historical texts gave us a good groundwork for discussion that could operate both on specific and more general levels, while her use of facsimiles and trips to see original objects opened out opportunities to understand the materials themselves more clearly and fully. Her ability to lead discussion in productive ways and to accomodate various levels of knowledge among her students without doing either the most knowledgeable nor the least a disservice is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good reading list, hands on learning experiences\r\nWeaknesses: focused primarily on Mexico, would have enjoyed learning more about manuscripts in other parts of the Americas ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent in all aspects. Discussions were deftly guided, assignments were reasonable and helpful for understanding the material, readings were interesting, and our class trips enriched the class work. Feedback was extensive and really beneficial for my writing and considering further paths of inquiry. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was an absolute joy, and an opportunity both to learn a great deal about a fascinating visual tradition and to learn more generalizable things about communication and visuality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, enjoyable classroom discussions & hands on learning. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, although I believe that coming into the course with no knowledge of pre-Hispanic or colonial Mexico would be challenging. "
