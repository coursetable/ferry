            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the different cultures/places that are French-speaking besides France. This was truly essential to learning more about French history and the impact of France on the global landscape, which in turn helped my education in the language itself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a wide variety of Francophone communities. I also learned useful grammar and vocabulary, and became more confident in expressing complex ideas in French. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of vocabulary words and learned a lot about themes that are present in French literature. ",
            "\u00a0We reviewed advanced French grammar. Read challenging French texts and watched movies that showed us about life in Francophone countries. We also worked on our essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I advanced my French grammar and work ethic significantly. I also gained a more global perspective on the Francophone world through reading stories written by authors from diverse Francophone countries. ",
            "\u00a0I finish my language sequence of the distributional requirements with a satisfactory knowledge of French. ",
            "\u00a0Developed some grammar, oratory skills, discussion and communication skills, reading and comprehension skills. Some insight into francophone cultures and contemporary issues in these countries. ",
            "\u00a0french ",
            "\u00a0I learned a couple new grammar concepts (prpositions with countries/states/cities) and refined a couple others (ex. faire causatif). I also developed my vocabulary and I feel that my speaking and listening skills greatly improved just from the immersive environment of the classroom and the bulk of reading and listening we had to do outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot fast "

            "\u00a0This class is strong because it immerses you in literature, which is really great and helps make the language easier to learn. However, the materials for this class are quite expensive. The course could be improved by offering less expensive options for materials. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the material that it covers. It was so refreshing to be in a French class that focused on the literature of Francophone communities other than France, or the stories of marginalized groups within France. Another strength of the class was that it was very conversational and discussion based, which was effective for expanding vocabulary and confidence. Also, we were able to revise our compositions, which helped me to improve my writing skills. \r\nOne weakness of the class was that there wasn't a ton of grammar instruction beyond the workbook exercises and our in-class review of the exercises. Overall, the class was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that it has a lot of discussion about vocabulary and literature, but grammar-wise, it is very challenging. The flipped classroom nature leaves everyone confused, and it would be much easier if the concepts were reviewed in class instead of a do-it-yourself thing in the course pack. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- the course pack is very helpful. The texts read were very interesting.\r\nWeakness - some of the grammar review at the beginning of the semester seemed a bit elementary. Audio exercises are time-consuming. Some in-class essay-writing review would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging in its structure (based on the Course Packet). The only weakness that comes to mind is its requisite of an unnecessary and expensive Grammar text, which is an unnecessary financial burden that was never actually used during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Daily work was generally tedious and unengaging. The student groups are hit or miss, but discussion is usually engaging depending on the topics. Grammar and reading focus can be uninteresting for speakers who are more interested in developing oral skills. The testing formats were ok for written/grammar but simply ridiculous for oral; speaking into a mic is not at all an accurate way to gauge engagement with another speaker in a real-time context. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course is the immersive environment that forces one to speak and engage in French. Another strength was the small class size which facilitated discussions and which also made class a lot of fun. The class was well organized and expectations were clear. A weakness may be the sheer amount of work that was assigned, but perhaps this is necessary in any language class. ",
            "\u00a0it's very heavy workload in the first half of the semester. lighter at the end "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who wants to learn French and become more knowledgeable about French literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The readings expanded both my vocabulary and my understanding of Francophone countries and cultures. The discussions were always thoroughly interesting and allowed me to be more comfortable communicating about important issues in French. ",
            "\u00a0The sad part is I wouldn't, but you have to take it anyway. It's not a course that actually improves your talking- it all just feels like teaching to a test. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with Madame Koundi. It was a fun class and I feel that my understanding of the language is stronger. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- anyone who wants to improve on all aspects of their French should take this course! ",
            "\u00a0No. If a student is looking to get their language requirement out of the way, they should steer clear of the French department. The department stifles intellectual engagement and curiosity with immense workloads and rigid expectations. ",
            "\u00a0For those seeking a language credit or to take their grammar and reading to the next level, this class would suffice. However for speakers wishing to take their oral, discussion and presentation skills towards the native level, this class will most likely fall short. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a great way to further refine and develop French skills while learning about Francophone culture, meeting new friends, and having a lot of fun along the way! It is a lot of work, but it is worth it --I really felt that my French improved even though many of the grammar concepts and vocabulary was already familiar to me. ",
