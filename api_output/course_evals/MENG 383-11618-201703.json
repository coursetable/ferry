            "\u00a0Stuff moves and it gets pretty complicated. This class helps understand that ",
            "\u00a0Continuum mechanics, rigid body mechanics,  little bit of system dynamics, just a bunch of physics really ",
            "\u00a0I became more familiar with linear algebra and matlab. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a lot of basic equations and laws governing motions of mechanical systems. It looks like an extension of intro physics, but Corey made it a lot more math and MATLAB heavy. It's cool to see how these methods of computation and analysis will help in computer simulations. ",
            "\u00a0That actually wasn't super clear. I guess if I had to describe it, it would be like, advanced physics concepts for engineers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned dynamics concepts! ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I gained a greater understanding of physics through the mechanical engineering lens, as it focused on applications such as collisions, vibrations, oscillations, etc. In addition, this course solidified my understanding of Matlab, as there were frequent problems on the homeworks that required Matlab, such as for doing molecular dynamics simulations, oscillation simulations, or rotations of vectors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Einstein notation, how to use tensors and some tensor transformations, as well as rotation matrices and associated systems of movement. Also developed a great deal of Matlab usability. ",
            "\u00a0i loved how Professer OHern taught us matlab in addition to the course material. ",
            "\u00a0This course used a lot of new notation including the levi civita symbol and the kronecker delta, building our math skills as well as coding ability (in Matlab mostly), in addition to learning dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0I have improved my matlab skills, I've also learned more about rotations in 3D, as well as vibrations in 2D "

            "\u00a0This course did a good job tying in MATLAB and real life research, which I found valuable. It wasn't reflected on the exams, which was kinda frustrating that a lot of work went into stuff we wouldn't be evaluated for, but it makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was worthless, we would go over some conceptually very difficult stuff in class and then I would look at the textbook to help understand it and it made no sense. It didn't even have very useful problems to practice with. That was my first issue. The other problem I had we already discussed in class which was the fact that the homework was a lot of Matlab and then the tests were all problems done on paper, which I understand the logic of, it was just a little tough to know what to expect on the tests. I wouldn't even mind having longer homeworks if it meant more problems to practice with because like I said the book was not very helpful ",
            "\u00a0The strongest weakness was that there did not really seem to be a connection between anything we learned.  The curriculum was interesting but disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Corey really made the class fun and engaging, with occasional jokes and stories. He also uploads his lecture notes which are helpful with catching up on anything missed in class. Grading was chill. Homework sessions literally saved our lives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were fast paced and could easily throw you off. There's no matching textbook that he refers do, nor do the questions come from the text. There aren't many problems to practice with, which made preparing for exams a little more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes very confusing what exactly we were learning, and what matched up with the textbook and when. Psets didn't quite match the exams which was difficult. Learning and using matlab was a huge benefit though. ",
            "\u00a0Material was interesting and well taught. Practice exams were excellent, but problem sets could be more consistent or focused. Organization during lecture could go a long way to help students stay organized. Maybe using titles before starting each topic and writing them on the board so no one is lost. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the topics we were learning were a little more clear. Otherwise, it was a good class!! ",
            "\u00a0This course did a very good job of explaining the necessary material without a textbook, as sometimes the textbook explanations would be far too complicated for the applications at hand. I believe that in the future, the course might be improved through increased in-class practice problems, as it was sometimes unclear how to start the homework problems. ",
            "\u00a0Tests were challenging when compared to practice tests, and some lectures are very hard to sit through. The good thing though is that Corey is a great lector and can be very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This call was incredibly disorganized and difficult to follow. Students were often left wondering what the purpose of each lecture was or how they were at all connected to what we had been doing in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I loved learning matlab in the psets, but I also wish there were a few more pencil and paper problem to prepare us for the tests ",
            "\u00a0Content was good, i felt like the matlab psets were useless ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor O'Hern managed this class well, he made the workload manageable and the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The work load of this course was slightly higher than normal, probably because every assignment was graded. However, there was enough time and opportunities to clarify doubts with the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well taught. All of the essentials are emphasized and well explained. There is a good balance of theory and practical application. "

            "\u00a0Corey is an awesome professor. You likely need to take the course, but if not, I'd suggest it if you have the background. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking the class it's because you have to. It's not bad, Corey's way better than Udo, just show up and you'll learn stuff ",
            "\u00a0Of all of the required MENG courses, it is not the worst. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to & with Corey if you want to learn more about the applications of the subject in research and molecular dynamics simulation. Otherwise, you might prefer other instructors who might have a more structured approach. ",
            "\u00a0Seriously only take it if you're ABET much E. There's better classical mechanics courses out there. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course and Professor O'Hern did a good job with it. It's important to make sure you understand your notes so you can keep up with the material, because sometimes the problem sets don't really follow the type of stuff that will be on the exam, but there are great practice tests. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it for your major! ",
            "\u00a0I would really only recommend this course to a student in the Mechanical Engineering major since that's where it is most applicable, but I think that with Corey teaching the class the experience might be better than with other lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0For me, the MatLab assignments were a lot of fun and Corey had a lot of insights into how to use matrices/tensors and vectors to do meaningful stuff with the dynamics of a system. So I would recommend it for anyone with interest in the representation of dynamic systems. It's also not a bad requirement for the major. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously if youre looking at this class, its required for you. So just buckle in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if Professor OHern is teaching it ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to  take this class if youre looking at it. Corey is an OG. Material isnt bad. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, but it is a very mechanical engineering specific course (I would assume only mechE's will be interested in it). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that it teaches some of the skills that are essential to the engineering curriculum ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking any course with Corey O'Hern. He teaches well and understands how students work. "
