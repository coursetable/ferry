            "\u00a0I was very familiar with the developmental psychology literature on social groups, but from this course I gained a much broader picture of the psychology of group life. I had never before read any work on how comparative psychologists, primatologists, entomologists, etc. conceive of animal social (and non-social) groupings. It was very cool, very informative!! ",
            "\u00a0A great deal of insight into cognition that occurs within and between groups. ",
            "\u00a0A broad and thorough overview of group psychology, beginning from he perspective of evolutionary biology, and focusing mainly on human psychology. "

            "\u00a0While this was a seminar course, Prof. Dunham came prepared with a presentation that explained the theme of that week's readings, provided background information about topics when necessary, and then also directed us towards specific discussion questions. I really liked this. \r\n\r\nI didn't love that, rather than talk with each other, it often felt like we were each having an individual discussion with Prof. Dunham. I mentioned this in my mid-semester feedback and Prof. Dunham tried different ways to alleviate this. I think, by mid-semester, we were all pretty set in our ways, and so it didn't really work especially well. But I really like that Prof. Dunham took my feedback seriously! And I recommend he try the same strategies he was using before and then use them when he teaches the class next semester. \r\n\r\nAlso, there was quite a bit of reading for this course. Some of the early readings are especially technical and quite dense. It would have been nice if, for some of the earlier weeks, there was less reading. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength was getting students to present on some of the reading material at the beginning of the class - it made for a good platform for discussion throughout the rest of the class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to an advanced undergraduate or graduate student. I think this class really benefitted, as currently structured, from being an upper-level discussion course. If you needed to stop to learn background information while taking this course, the readings would take even longer. And there's A LOT of reading for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a very effective dive into an interesting component of cognition. ",
            "\u00a0A really good course, definitely take it! Perhaps slightly difficult to do with less of a developed background in psychology, but this should NOT deter those who are truly interested in this particular area of psychology, perhaps because it ties in closely with their other academic interests. I fit in this categoryand am very glad I took the course. "
