I think it tried to accomplish too much in a short time-frame and may be better as a full semester class. Either that, or assignments should be less vigorous and streamlined. \r\n\r\nAlso, the 6-8pm timing of this class is just bad.

I think student engagement would be higher if the course was offered in the first half of the semester rather than the second half. ",

Perhaps a full semester course would be better.  \r\nI would have also appreciated this knowledge in the beginning of the semester rather than the second half of the semester since I could have used it for other classes.

",
            "\u00a0I think Maureen does a great job. Maybe more of a focus with some of TAs to help with the homework could be useful to go through some of the stuff outside of class (or review sessions of the hard skills) ",
            "\u00a0Maureen Burke really cares about what shes teaching and she cares about all of her students. She gets through as much as possible within the time allotted. It would have been more helpful for me if we did more lecture work on excel, rather than on powerpoint slides ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the subject material is taught in a relatable way, and it's a quick overview of things we wouldn't learn otherwise. Weaknesses are that even though the slides are provided, they're often presented very quickly and it's difficult to take notes. When the subject matter makes sense it's relatable, but it doesn't always make sense. ",
            "\u00a0Very difficult to learn anything. Half the class time period was taken up with an unstructured \"in class exercise\" for which we received almost NO guidance, we were just thrown into the deep end of the pool and expected to swim. The TAs didnt help and the instructor didnt either. We were supposed to get help from each other, but if you were sitting next to someone who was slacking off or also confused, that was hopeless. In such a large room with such a variety of people, it was very chaotic and difficult to concentrate or work. \r\nThe materials for us to learn from were mostly just the instructor's powerpoint slides, which had typos and errors. A lot of time was spent on Investopedia trying to get the full story on things that were not clearly explained by the lectures or readings. In addition, the instructor seemed disinterested while lecturing and was hard to hear. \r\nI think the way to improve the course would be to hire someone to teach it who actually WANTS to teach the material implied by the course title and who has the skill to lecture in an engaging fashion. Have the \"in class exercises\" be in small breakout groups with a TA leading them, instead of a big mosh pit. Assign homework and reading that have some relation to each other and to environmental management. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Got the notes for future reference. In the future, if I forget a term, I can refer to these notes for backup.\r\nWeaknesses - didn't get much feedback on homework, so don't know what I did wrong. ",

            "\u00a0More designated time outside of class for review would have been helpful, like TA sessions. \r\n\r\nLectures and assignments were good. \r\n\r\nAlso, would be great if this was at the beginning of the year to help with other classes and projects that happen later in the year. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the exercises that we did because they were very well designed. However, the professor spoke really fast and the class exercises were even faster. I wish that we could have had more time to discuss the exercises in class. ",
            "\u00a0Maureen's lecture notes are excellent! ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though lectures were a glossary of many topics, which I probably could have gained from online research or reading a book that is an overview of finance and accounting. It would be helpful for this to be full-length semester course that allows students to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts. ",

People would often call out answers, which couldn't be heard at the front, which discouraged participation. Also, splitting into two smaller sections would encourage more discussion / questions, I think. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class makes engaging difficult. With a two-hour nighttime class, the powerpoints should be more engaging. The in class exercises helped a lot, but it was difficult to pay attention in all other parts. ",

            "\u00a0The lecture notes are very helpful. Maureen was kind and learned everyone's name. The TA sessions were very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were dry and unengaging. I often felt lost during the practice time in class. It would be helpful to go over the in-class work step by step rather than running through the answers quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course could be improved by using more excel from the beginning. I was confused as to why we were only using word documents for the first three classes. ",
            "\u00a0Very efficient, and incredibly useful information. Maureen walked through some of the exercises or content very quickly at times. The powerpoint decks have good information, but felt quite outdated. ",
            "\u00a0The course flies through a lot of information very quickly. I found the in-class exercises to be very helpful for working through new information and referring back to during homework assignments. However, we often went over the answers quickly, making it difficult to follow the numbers/math/answers on the slide deck as we went over the solutions. I appreciated the notes provided on class lecture topics, though sometimes those could be hard to follow. Nevertheless, they area very good resource, especially to review information later after the course ended. "
