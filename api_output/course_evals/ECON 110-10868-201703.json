            "\u00a0I gained a very strong understanding of microeconomics, and this was after taking one year of microeconomics already in high school. I definitely learned a lot of new content. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding a intuition for microeconomics, as advertised in the course description. I better understand rationality ind decision making and gained skills that will help me analyze and understand decisions much beyond economics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about microeconomics and how the economy works. It was a great introduction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think rationally as an consumer and I also gained a better understanding of economics. I also gained great life advice and received motivation for how to push through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory knowledge of market structure and consumer/producer behavior. Also, a lot of life tips from Tolga. ",
            "\u00a0This course reaffirmed and deepened my knowledge of many microeconomic concepts that I had been superficially exposed to in high school. The application of these concepts in the problem sets was especially empowering, as we could see just how practical and applicable what we were learning is in the 'real world'. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good class overall. I learned much more about many economic concepts (I took AP Micro, and we covered a lot more). ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I learned how to approach real-world problems with a more practical and useful mindset. For instance, although I remain a strong opponent of gentrification, I learned that implementing rent control laws is not the smartest way to solve the problem it poses. More generally, though, I learned to reach out for help, acknowledging that my own efforts sometimes are not enough to help me succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned various aspects of economic theory such as market structures, production functions, consumer theory, economics of information, and game theory. Overall, I have a more practical view of the world, and I learned how economic concepts play into everyday life seamlessly. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to microeconomics, with which I had no prior experience. Now I understand the basic economic theories about consumers and firm behavior. ",
            "\u00a0Basics of econ, how to read a textbook, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0By being in this course, I felt like I gained a huge amount of knowledge about how the world works.  Thanks to the textbook we used and the professor's own examples, I could use econ to explain things I saw in my life and trends in the world.  This is something that students in other intro micro classes have told me seems special about my class, and I definitely believe that is the case. "

            "\u00a0The teacher goes over the p-sets every week, so it is very easy to score highly on them. Also, the lectures are engaging and really help you understand the content without you needing to go home and teach yourself. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent; Tolga is a great teacher, the material was interesting and presented well, and each student was listened to. The weaknesses were that the end of the course felt a little rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Strength-- gain a strong understanding of the material and Tolga is always there to answer questions\r\nWeakness-- if the textbook could be more directly referenced in class so that those who are following know where they need to be. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is, most importantly, that it is taught by Tolga. The material can be dry at times, but Tolga finds a way to always keep it interesting. Another strength is that the problem sets and exams are always very fair -- no surprise questions on never-before-seen topics. ",
            "\u00a0Course was smaller and provided a more in depth understanding of the course material. Used real life examples and took time to effectively answer questions during class. ",
            "\u00a0The class moved through concepts very quickly, so it was difficult at times to fully grasp content matter before we were introduced to the next thing. I found that the course required a great deal of revision come examination periods. ",
            "\u00a0My only advice for this course would be for the answers to the textbooks questions to be accessible to students. ",
            "\u00a0The class is marketed as a seminar, but lacks the small class feel. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is an amazing instructor. The p-sets and classes prepare the students well for the exam. You have a lot of support as you take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely helpful lectures, notes, and problem sets. The professor made himself available so much, and there were many opportunities to get help. The information was conveyed logically, and the material was captivating when substantiated by real world examples.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was unclear how the textbook should be used. I never used it and did just fine, but the professor strongly encouraged the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about the course was well tailed to help students learn and succeed. The small class size made it much more easy for students to ask questions during class. The professor also made himself incredibly accessible after class and during office hours to help students with the problem sets and the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is a wonderful lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely does a thorough overview of microeconomics. However, the course is introductory and does only give an overview -- there are moments during the course where the textbook goes more in depth in certain concepts by providing applications etc. while the content of the course does not cover them. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was teaching us how to use econ to describe the world and people's actions, as opposed to just solving equations and graphs (which was useful in its own way).  \r\n\r\nI think it could be improved by leading the teaching with the explanations of trends in peoples' actions and then learning the numbers and equations after.  (We did it the other way around.) "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is a very interesting course taught in an engaging setting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Economics is critical for understanding the world, it was too difficult of a course, and the teacher was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, economics is just a great class to take in general, and this class is great for it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to understand microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is infinitely better than the lecture. The material is actually learned, the exams accurately reflect the problem sets and in-class work, and, most of all, Tolga is an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they do not enjoy lectures. Great way to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially over the lecture format of Econ 115. I found the class to be engaging and it was fantastic to have the opportunity to clarify the concepts covered by asking questions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be wary of the curve. However, it's much better to take a seminar versus a lecture class ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As a student who had no prior background in economics, I found that the the instructors were willing to explain material in the simplest terms. ",
            "\u00a0This class is designed for students with a strong math (and alomst all students will have some Econ background). You have nothing to prove, if all you want is a n into to econ, take the lecture. The curve is kinder and the course materials are more user friendly. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend! Take intro as a seminar and with Tolga! ",
            "\u00a0YES. To anyone. These basic economic concepts are important for anyone who wants to be a smart consumer or worker in any field. In order to be successful, we need to understand economics because its how money works in this country; and, unfortunately, money does make the world go round. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would! Not only would I recommend Econ 110 for its smaller class size but I would also highly recommend the class because it is taught by Prof Koker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student -- even though it is a prerequisite/requisite for many majors, if you are interested in developing a solid foundation in economics and would prefer to not sit in a 400+ person lecture (Econ 115), I would definitely recommend Econ 110. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course.  I think that this seminar was interesting and engaging in addition to obviously providing useful information to have about the way the world works (not just economic graphs/ formulas). "
