This course was one of the most relevant to my PhD studies and will remain a set of statistics skills I will bring forth in my career forevermore.  I've also had my linear algebra and math skills refreshed, which help me to better understand what underlies each of the statistical tests. ",

            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material very quickly. It gave me some insight into what options are available for multivariate analysis in statistics, but I think more depth would have helped me to choose when a particular method is most appropriate and  the results of a given method. In effect, I have a broad understanding of the concepts but not mastery of them. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really good at teaching a variety of multivariate methods. It struck a perfect balance between digging into the methods & proofs just enough to have a basic understanding of the underlying mathematics, while also focusing on the practical application of how to carry out the methods in a variety of computing environments. JRS also provided example scripts that helped us figure out how to start on the analyses\r\nA huge strength was the recorded lectures. I had a conflict every Thursday with the class time and was only able to take the course because everything was recorded. I'm so glad I had this opportunity because I would have really missed out if I hadn't taken this course.\r\nThere were very few weaknesses. The one thing I can remember is that there wasn't a good example of how to do multivariate or univariate contrasts in R. I know JRS said there weren't any packages that did this, but when I was googling around I seemed to come across a few that purported to offer multivariate contrasts. Unfortunately, when I dug into how to use those packages I quickly got lost because the documentation went over my head. Maybe this is something for JRS to take a look at again and see if he can write a brief example script for multivariate contrasts. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: This class was engaging and designed in such a way that demonstrates a commitment to student learning. I never wanted to miss a single lecture, but on the occasions when it was inevitable, the video-recordings of the lectures proved invaluable. I appreciated the applied nature of the assignments as well as the thoughtfulness of the professor, who provided sample data sets to use for those who didn't have access to one of their own. I really enjoyed how the assignments were structured and the opportunity to work with a team on them was helpful in truly understanding concepts rather than just regurgitating what was said in class. Dr. Reuning-Scherer is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure of taking class with and I not only learned a lot about multivariate statistics from him, but also about how teaching should be done in general.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had gotten feedback on assignments sooner.

            "\u00a0The only major weakness in the course was not getting homework back in a timely fashion and, when we did get grades, we got them with little to no feedback.  Some of us were working with data of importance to research groups here at Yale, so it would've been nice to have gotten more feedback on our homework assignments. ",

Jonathan was amazingly flexible about his class structure and took ample time to come to office hours (especially towards the end of the semester)\r\n\r\nWeakeness- not enough feedback on assignments to know how you are doing throughout the course. This class may need more TA's. ",
