            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about the processes on the surface of the planet, carbon systems, ocean systems, mountains, this course covers it all. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty early on in the course, you learn how to identify various sedimentary rocks. For the remainder of the term, you have to take a rapid fire rock-quiz at the beginning of each meeting. Also, silicate weathering is what keeps Earth inhabitable. "

            "\u00a0This class was incredibly disorganized, bouncing between not only the two lecturers, but between subjects with virtually no connection between them. It was very difficult to keep up with the material or to walk away with an understanding of what was important to the professors. There was absolutely no feedback on how we were doing in the class (only 2 homework assignments in the first weeks of class which were not graded until after spring break when we asked for grades), and \"rock quizzes\" which were not returned to us so we couldn't really see how we were making progress. The midterm was sprung on us in April, which also was definitely non-ideal and made it very difficult for people who were considering a credit/D conversion or dropping the class in general. It just didn't seem like the professors were on top of their work enough to get us grades, which makes taking any class very difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were subjects which were discussed in class that you could tell the professors were passionate about and that made it somewhat more engaging and worth the effort. Overall, I just wish there was a bit more structure in the course so that it didn't always feel like you were drowning or confused. ",
            "\u00a0I am still a little confused about the structure/organization of this class, but because this was a very small lecture I felt that the ability to have discussions and ask questions really helped me to be engaged in the class and deepen my understanding of the concepts.  Both Noah and Mark are great teachers, engaging lecturers and incredibly knowledgeable.  However, I feel that both of their lecture slides could be improved, a lot of the slides were just graphs or photos with no captions which could make going back over them a little confusing if you didn't take good enough notes in class. ",
            "\u00a0Wildly unorganized, but that made the course more exciting. "

            "\u00a0I would, if you're interested in the material because there isn't really another way to get this material while a Yale undergrad. However, brace for the confusion, disorganization, and in class debates and bickering between the two professors. ",
            "\u00a0If you aren't a G&G major, I would probably take the course with a G&G major you're close to. It was a manageable course, but all of the students were equally confused on the same topics, so if a hardcore Geo kid is in the course then that could be a nightmare. "
