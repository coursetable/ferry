            "\u00a0I got a good understanding of the theoretical and mathematical side of elementary physics. It was nice to see all the derivations in detail and learn how to apply them. ",
            "\u00a0As you would expect, introductory physics. Pretty much the same content of mechanics, Lagrangians, special relativity, and electromagnetism, but with more emphasis on derivations and proofs. Which are not needed for exams and doing problems anyway so it is really for interest. ",
            "\u00a0You'll pretty much do a full year of AP Physics and more in this class. Very fast paced, but Baltay is a wonderful man. ",
            "\u00a0Very fast paced course through mechanics, E+M, special relatively (yikes), EM radiation, and we even got to optics. Practiced a lot of multivariable calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an insight into relatively and the unifying theory of electromagnetism, Maxwell's equations, which I had not known before. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Newtonian mechanics, a bit of Lagrangian stuff, special relativity, and electricity and magnetism. ",
            "\u00a0I understand derivations of mechanics, special relativity, and e&m much better now. It's really quite cool to see how all the different concepts presented in a high school physics class relate and derive. ",
            "\u00a0Extensive knowledge of topics in Mechanics (Newton's Laws, rotational motion, harmonic motion, momentum, work and energy, Lagrangian mechanics, special relativity) and Electricity & Magnetism (electric fields, magnetic fields, induction, electromagnetic radiation). An overall deeper understanding and appreciation for physics. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 260 taught me to be a better problem solver. It developed my ability to \"think physics,\" both in terms of visual intuition as well as in terms of mathematical rigor. Professor Baltay is an experienced expositor and his lectures are clear and inspiring. His love for the subject shines through in his lectures. The course covered all of the Advanced Placement C (both E&M and Mechanics) syllabus as well as special relativity, electromagnetic radiation and Lagrangian mechanics. All in one semester! While the course moves quickly through this material, I found myself understanding the topics covered in depth. The books used (Griffiths' Electrodynamics and Taylor's Mechanics) are excellent. The perspective provided is dual: Prof. Baltay lays out the physical and geometric intuition in lecture. The mathematical detail then becomes apparent in weekly problem sets. The course does lean more towards theoretical physics than other similar introductory physics courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a brief overview of most of mechanics and E&M. I didn't feel like I developed insight beyond those skills in terms of physics. I developed MANY insights however about my expectations of Yale, its professors, and its resources. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me understand physics to greater depth than my high school class. \r\n\r\nThis course also strengthened my algebra/vector calculus. \r\n\r\nProfessor Baltay also showed us interesting derivation of phenomena and ways of thinking about physics. ",
            "\u00a0Reviewed main concepts from AP Physics C, but with much more mathematical rigor. Also covered some additional interesting topics (Lagrangian Mechanics and Special Relativity). ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about problem solving in problems modelling the real world. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a very fast-paced introduction to many topics in physics; PHYS 260 has gone through all of classical mechanics (up to Lagrangian formalism), Special Relativity, and Electro Magnetism up through waves and matter (we covered all of E and B fields in a vacuum, and did all of Maxwell). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply multivariable calculus to physics and the natural world -- which showed how so many complex equations/ideas can be derived from a very simple basis. ",
            "\u00a0Not many - I learned special relativity and practiced the calculus of electrodynamics. By and large, though, this class was a waste of time. It's positioned awkwardly as both an intro course and an advanced course. It covers stuff that we'll see again in more depth, and since its a first year course, we aren;t expected to do anything advanced with what we're learning (what's the point, for example, of learning the lagrangian but only using it to solve problems that are more easily solved with newton's laws). It should be more clear that taking 410 as a first year is an option (and it would have helped if the physics DUS had responded to my email at the beginning of the semester concerning which physics I should start with). Having taken classical mechanics at a college last year (and using taylor's book), I know I would have done fine in 410 - I wish I hadn't wasted my time in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Physics, lots of proving ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my understanding of Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism, and I incoporated more advanced math than I had before with physics. ",
            "\u00a0The first semester of this course was largely a review on mechanics and electricity and magnetism, but our classes on relativity were particularly interesting and eye-opening. We also learned a lot about applying mathematical concepts to real-world forces, in a way that helped us understand them better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the development of the theory of modern physics. Lots of derivations of key equations and concepts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I guess it could be made clearer what is on the test and what is not, e.g. how much of the derivations do we need to know, considering that we don't ever have to re-derive some famous results like Maxwell's equations or Lorentz transformations. That is, how much of the lessons is for interest and how much is really important for us to know. ",
            "\u00a0Baltay is great. The class can move a little too fast in my opinion though. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures often went too quickly and over my head with convoluted proofs that we did not need to know. Exams were easier than what we learned in lecture. Very interesting stuff with special relativity too. I would probably have enjoyed the course much more if it was slower, however this is technically an advanced intro course so this should be expected. ",
            "\u00a0The course has just the right amount of workload and a great introduction to the world of physics. ",
            "\u00a0Baltay's lectures are very cool and interesting and well organized. Sometimes he goes a little fast (although he does ask if he should slow down and no one speaks up). \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is the support. While many math / computer science classes have a strong tutoring staff and form a community around the classes, this class does not. \r\n\r\nWe had one TA with office hours who was great and hosted problem sessions, however his office hours were the day after problem sets were due which made it hard to ask for help if I was confused with concepts on a problem set.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if there were some peer tutors who students could go to with questions later in the day / evening (not during times other classes meet), and to do that it would likely have to be undergraduates who have also gone through the same class. I don't know if that's feasible but it would be great to have more people / more times when one can ask for help. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Baltay is a great lecturer, and the homework assignments and assessments were fair. The problem sessions were useful as well.\r\n\r\nThe class moves a little too quickly, and I wish we paused more often to do example problems in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength is in its breadth and depth. This is, as the course title indicates, an introductory physics course. However, it is incredible in what it achieves, in terms of the material covered and also the detail with which it is covered. Be prepared to work hard, particularly if you do not have detailed physics experience prior to taking the course. That being said, the workload is completely manageable. If you love physics you'll very likely love this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course had many, many weaknesses. It was not engaging. There were no peer tutors, accessible office hours, or ways to get help. Physics 180 and 200 both have HOURS of peer tutoring and office hours available for students to practice and master material. Physics 260 is still considered an introductory course, and this is Yale. There should be tutors available for the course. There should be resources, this institution CAN afford it, and simply because 260 is intensive doesn't mean that its students wouldn't need or benefit from actually having the resources to be taught. Furthermore, the exams were so incredibly small in question number that I never felt that I was being tested on what I taught myself. More frequent quizzes or exams would be much fairer and better reflect the content of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the fact that though the material was learned quickly and intensively, the problem sessions facilitated analytical and hands-on learning of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught. However, Professor Baltay sometimes made algebraic mistakes on the boards, which sometimes made his work a bit hard to follow. On the other hand, I think this helped me improve my algebra. \r\n\r\nThe course was scheduled right at lunchtime, so I was often hungry during class. This sometimes made concentrating a little difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Covers a lot of interesting content and topics.\r\nWeakness: Lectures can sometimes be hard to follow as it progresses very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Introduces topics that are not usually seen before college such as special relativity and Lagrangian mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: doesn't require you to toil over mechanics, especially if it's stuff you're already pretty comfortable with. Baltay is a great professor, he really knows his stuff and can explain things pretty well (which also requires you be in class and alert, because if you miss the explanation, you can't really find it in a book anywhere). // Weaknesses: the difficulty ramps up significantly once you get into E&M, and I wasn't really prepared to put in the extra work in the second half of the semester, especially since I had other finals/stuff for clubs/etc. coming up, which really made me feel like I was falling behind in the course. I ended up dropping the course on the last day of the semester and taking a W, since I wasn't sure if I'd be able to sufficiently catch up over reading period and relearn everything. So basically, be ready to really grind when it comes to E&M. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was very interesting. The material covered is really intriguing, and Baltay is very clearly passionate about Physics in a way that is inspiring to the class. The workload of the class is very reasonable (the psets can be completed in one to two afternoons of work) and are a very good review for the midterms. Although the exams can feel kind of brutal, the grading is pretty lenient (I was shocked at how many points I got on my midterm, compared to how poorly I thought I did), and so you don't need to worry too much about the exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is really disorganized. The biggest problem is an utter lack of communication between the instructor and the TF (as in, I'm not quite sure if they've every spoken to each other). Each on their own is a fine teacher, but that starts to become a real problem when it comes time to review for exams. To start with, Baltay seemed suprised that we wanted even one review session for the exams (the chem classes my friends are in have like 5 review sessions), and because it was led by the TF, not the teacher, the review for the midterm was kind of useless; we 'reviewed' material that we hadn't covered in class and which wasn't on the test. Secondly, Baltay is a very old school lecturer; this isn't inherently a bad thing, but it means that his involvement in the class ends when the class period does, so there is no outside help or support for the class the way there is for many of the math courses. I really wish this class had 1) more involved TFs, 2) MORE TFs, one was not enough, 3) More communication between the instructor and the TFs, 4) more review materials. ",
            "\u00a0There was minimal support offered for the course -- few office hours, no peer tutors, etc. However, it was very intellectually stimulating, and I would not have opted not to take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course needn't exist. It really serves no good purpose other than wasting the first year for physics majors. This beginning impression of the physics department is disheartening, I can only hope it improves in the coming years. ",
            "\u00a0Please add more sections ",
            "\u00a0The course moves quickly, which is a lot of fun. Sometimes, particularly towards the end of the semester, classes were moving too quickly for my taste, but there are effective resources that allowed me to stay on top of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is interesting, but the lecture format is often dry. I think if we did more practical demonstrations or problems in class then it would be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the problem sets force you to learn the material throughout the semester, and prepare you pretty well for the midterm and final. A big weakness in my opinion is that a lot of the math is glazed over in lecture. I ended up having to read the textbook a lot in order to figure out how to do the problem sets. There are lots of derivations in class however, so if you can follow the math he puts on the board it might be a lot easier for you "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It is a difficult class, but Baltay makes it as interesting and easy to learn as possible. If you are interested in the math and the theory behind the physics, then it is definitely the best intro physics course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yea. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0This class may be much easier than you expected and many touted if you already have a lot of experience with college-level physics, and understandbly Yale so since Yale does not attract too many science-focused students, but it is worth pointing out. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But only if you took at least AP physics E+M in high school (I only took E+M and was mostly fine with the mechanics). If you have never seen E+M before, you will probably need to spend a LOT of time understanding the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who likes physics and would like to go a little beyond the AP physics curriculum from high school. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 260 was a very enjoyable physics course! The lectures were informative and interesting (though a bit fast a times), Professor Baltay was a very engaging lecturer with lots of little mannerisms that kept the class entertained. The exams overall were mostly fair (testing on material mostly covered on the lecture). The problem sets felt useful and also not too long (probably 3 hrs per pset). Baltay brings in not just the standard equations, but randoms facts and stories behind the physics that make it really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the time to really work through the material outside of class, then yes. Otherwise you will just feel lost and won't get much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have taken any physics courses in high school before and have an interest in physics, I would definitely recommend that you take this course. It's not as hard as people seem to think. The class moves really quickly, but the homework assignments are very manageable and the exams are fair. As long as you go to lecture and review the concepts at home, you will be fine. The problem sessions are good practice, and the review sessions before exams are great for telling you what to study. Professor Baltay is a great lecturer and makes the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, but only if you are interested in physics as an end in itself. The course provides an excellent grounding in first principles: the things you learn in this course are foundational, lessons for life. Even for people who are not intending on a major in physics, if you want a rigorous understanding of the subject from the mathematical and geometric perspectives, take this course. The workload may be a bit more for those who haven't seen AP physics, but it is certainly manageable (and there are some who do manage). Baltay is a fantastic lecturer and he is very approachable. Throughout his lectures, he periodically stops and checks in with us, to make sure everyone is following along properly. A great class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. I don't feel like it really teaches. It gives such cursory overviews of topics, although very familiar to most students, that doesn't allow for mastery of the material. There are no resources to ask for help or get feedback on PSETS or ways to further master the skills on the PSETS. The problem sessions for the class were on Fridays at noon, which made them incredibly difficult for most people to attend, and furthermore, for those who did, they were mostly unhelpful because the material was blown through without actual explanation. The majority of students in the course I spoke with found that they were relying solely on their high school knowledge and otherwise didn't learn much beyond it. You might as well just pick up the books and teach yourself over the summer... You'd have just as many resources. It is absurd to me that students could be paying exorbitant amounts of money to this institution only to not have any help or teaching. They don't need to pay money for that. Purchasing the 50 dollar textbook would've been enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, professor Baltay does a great job in explaining things to his students, with his own charm and wit. Students taking this class should, however, go to the problem sessions in order to really get a firm grasp of the material, without this the class would be magnitudes harder. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the course covers many interesting topics in physics to greater depth than other introductory physics courses and shows many interesting derivations of equations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone who has taken AP Physics C and knows multivariable calculus, this class is the best intro physics class to take. If you do not have a multivariable calculus background tho, this class will be a struggle for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\n\r\nThe course provides a good introduction to mechanics and E&M, as well as topics most will not have seen before. ",
            "\u00a0If you had a lot of preparation in physics in high school but aren't sure if you want to continue, then yes. That was me, and after taking this course I realized that I don't want to do physics. It's nice because you don't spend too much time on reviewing mechanics and can get straight to some of the harder E&M stuff first semester, so you get to see test the waters of E&M first semester instead of having to go through two semesters.\r\n\r\nAnd then, obviously, if you had a lot of preparation in physics and are SURE that you want to go into physics, then 260 is nice because you can skip over the mechanics and do some E&M. Basically, if you're at all considering physics and you feel prepared, then take 260. That said, beware that the difficulty increased significantly after the midterm once you go into E&M, so be prepared to put in some work if you want to do well. ",
            "\u00a0If you are thinking of pursuing math or physics, absolutely. The material is so interesting and you will feel really accomplished at how much you understand. I've heard that Baltay won't be teaching it next year, so if he isn't, don't let anything you've read (good or bad) about his teaching influence your decision. The class is phenomenally interesting and if you get a good group of people from your class together, it can make doing the work really fun (don't just copy stuff down though, or you will have a bad time on the exams). Also, if you do take it, REVIEW the homework for the exam; the midterm was basically lifted from our psets, which would have been nice to know before we took the midterm. The final was very heavy on derivations, so know your vector calc derivations and practice anything that begins with the phrase \"Prove that...\".\r\n\r\nIf not, that makes the question a little harder. I do know quite a few people who are dissatisfied with the class, and may drop it at semester. If you are taking MATH 230, the workload will seem really light; if not, you may find the workload to be fairly heavy, so consider that. Also, side not about the 'requirement' for MATH 230: It's not a requirement. Baltay put that on the syllabus to scare people off who don't want to do math. In all honesty, MATH 120 is probably more aligned with PHYS 260, since we don't cover integral analysis in 230 until second semester. It's entirely possibly to take both, but you don't have to. Also, the same goes for high school preparation: a 5 on Physics C isn't at all required, my school didn't offer calc-based physics, but I've taken a fair bit of calc (up through multivariable in high school) and I did fine in the class; just be prepared to learn as you go. Also, I can't recommend enough buying a copy of the Exercises for the Feynman Lectures, which are really useful for studying and practicing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they have the proper foundation in mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0No; if they are a non-physics student looking to take an interesting science credit than 200 does the job. If they are a physics major with a strong background than 410 is the place to start. Classical mechanics is what naturally follows AP Physics C - I don't see the need for any of this in between stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Cuz baltay is okay, the material is not bad. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was an exciting and effective introductory physics class. ",
            "\u00a0I would, with caution. I think you really need to be interested in physics to do this course, and you have to be willing to move quickly through loads of material. But I think that it is worth it because the material is so cool. ",
            "\u00a0If you like derivations, take this class. If you're just trying to take a higher level intro physics class because you've already taken some physics in high school or something, don't take this. You don't get much new out of it in terms of physics knowledge (until maybe the second semester, cuz you go into general relativity, but I wouldn't know yet). But you do get a lot better at the math. Vector calculus and all that jazz, yike.\r\nProf Baltay is pretty fun and endearing at times, but make sure you give him feedback or he'll kinda do what he wants in lecture. "
