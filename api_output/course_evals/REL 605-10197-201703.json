            "\u00a0I think Wendy's strengths were absolutely the amount of comments and the attention put into grading our weekly papers. I was able to improve my writing over the course of the semester by taking into account the comments. I also appreciated Wendy's reasonable availability in meeting with Students about the course readings, progress, or anything else that came up over the duration of the semester. Additionally, I thought Wendy's lecture was well done and very helpful in contextualizing the readings for that week. One way that Wendy's teaching could have been improved would have been during the small group discussions in terms of moderating and getting more students to participate. I think that by calling on particular students or facilitating a more deliberate/higher stakes discussion would have been helpful. Sometimes participation in the sections was pretty lacking and relied on a few, consistent students. Since this is not been uncommon in my experience, I don't think it necessarily resulted from Wendy's leading of the discussion, but I think there are probably some ways a moderator can help mitigate that experience? ",
            "\u00a0(Future professor) Wendy Mallette did an excellent job in her role. When Wendy facilitated classroom discussions it was done thoughtfully and respectfully. The lecture Wendy provided was very informative and engaging. In addition, Wendy went way above and beyond in providing detailed comments on our writing assignments. I received very thoughtful and thorough comments. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was an exceptional TF. She was clear and meticulous in her feedback, and facilitated discussion well. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was very organized and accessible ",
            "\u00a0Wendy was a fantastic Teaching Fellow. She provided detailed and helpful comments on our short essays, and made herself available to students. Given the high number of assignments students were given, Wendy did a phenomenal job of grading and providing thorough comments. She was superb. ",
            "\u00a0Toughest grader I've had in three years at YDS!!! But the comments on my papers were thoughtful and all very helpful. Wendy's also very flexible in working with students and I appreciate that. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy is very thorough and organized with her teaching and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy is extremely knowledgeable AND approachable. Her lecture and comments on my work have been superb ",
            "\u00a0I thought Wendy provided valuable feedback on papers and helpfully engaged students in discussion after class. Her class lecture felt more like an academic conference presentation than a lecture, and I think there was room for improvement there in order to make it more engaging for non-experts in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy Mallette was good at giving feedback at the papers during class. It was clear in arguments and in response. Wendy also did a presentation during class that was interesting and well-thought through.

            "\u00a0Wendy is a very smart and approachable TA. She was a nice balance to Dr. Turman and very available outside of class times to meet. I found her advice and guidance extremely helpful and she helped me to grasp information I was struggling to wrap my head around. I think she was a wonderful TA. ",
            "\u00a0Wendy did a wonderful job of answering questions and concerns. She was intimately familiar with the material and did an outstanding job on the lecture she provided. "
