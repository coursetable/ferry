            "\u00a0I learned the difference between direct, indirect, and disjointed pronouns. I learned how to listen to different speakers and become better at holding a conversation. I also learned how to pronounce different types of vowels and words that sound the same like Lui and Louis. ",
            "\u00a0French is hard and requires a lot of time and dedication. I have learned much more french than I initially thought I would and now I know how important time management is. I need to set aside about 3 hours a night for french homework and I must review the videos regularly throughout the week. Tutoring is nothing to be ashamed of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic French and also struggled a lot through the semester.  I learned what it takes to succeed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Since this is my first formal introduction to the language, I learned an immense amount of knowledge from this course.  I have learned the basic grammar skills of French, and also some form of conversational French due to my teacher's focus on teaching us relevant French words. ",
            "\u00a0Listening, speaking, reading, writing French through pronunciation, conjugation, grammar, vocabulary and expressions. "

        [
            "\u00a0Although I learned about the pronouns, I still feel uncomfortable with the topic and I still need to improve my listening skills because its still difficult for me to understand when people speak fast. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very effective way to teach french. Engaging and fun.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it wasn't so test based. I get really anxious during tests and I do not perform well. I'm not sure how to fix this. My prof suggested I get a tutor, so I signed up for one. My tutor and I could never meet. I would email and she would take a week to get back to me. The last time I emailed her was about two weeks before finals and she never got back to me. It was terrible. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class discussions were great.  The video lessons were relatively engaging.  The long workbook assignments tended to sometimes not correlate with the test material, which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the videos may be a little outdated for current French speakers because it includes words and phrases that are no longer relevant. However, the video/class format was very helpful in setting up the week's topics and then flushing them out in class during the rest of the week. ",
            "\u00a0Since this course has been taught for a very long time, it has undergone many revisions to reach its current form today. Its current form is a refined and successful pedagogy of teaching French that works extremely well.\r\n\r\nThe courses structure of using Pierre Capretzs French in Action series is its strongest point. Using the video series allows students to learn French through a very personable and engaging manner. Furthermore, the French that is taught is not pedantic French that begins with alphabets, phonetics and tenses, but commences by throwing students into learning everyday French. Thus, students are immersed into working French from the first day, and so a working ability of French is expanded from within, rather than strung together from disparate concepts of grammar and vocabulary. \r\n\r\nOther than its video pedagogy, classroom pedagogy follows a weekly cycle that begins with the video screening, proceeds with classroom conversations and application of grammar/vocabulary, and culminates in a weekly examination. This weekly process keeps the rigor of learning French up and maintained, and is also where individual professors teaching style can shine (in particular, Prof Julie Hugonny). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the course staff as a whole (Prof Ngame, Prof Hugonny and Prof DeVos) is very personable and approachable. They bring the video series to life. Their adaptability to student needs is very successful too. Recognizing that the student cohort as a whole was struggling at the start and would be left in the lurch if the course continued its rapid pace, they slowed down the pace of syllabus to allow students to consolidate learning without compromising on the content of the course. \r\n\r\nOne small area of improvement is in providing answers to course packets throughout the course, so that the course packet can also be used as an individual resource for learning (if materials in the course packet were replaced by classroom-specific materials).

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who are looking to speak French because I think the program does help you learn the language at a quick pace. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a test based type of person because the majority of the grade was the weekly quizzes. I also wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to dedicate about 16 hours a week on the homework. It's not too bad if you have good time management and it's great if you have a tutor to help you with speaking and other stuff, but I didn't have that and I sort of got burned out towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0I would if they have a background in and care deeply about French, otherwise I might suggest they choose a different language unless they are willing to devote a lot of time to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course for any student who at all wants to learn French. The French Department here in Yale is known for being one of the most well organized and on the ball, and my experience in this course does not disappoint. Granted, this course will take up a significant amount of time with weekly video viewings, daily workbook exercises, weekly compositions, and weekly tests. However, if you want to learn a language properly here at Yale, this is the class to take. No pain, no gain. "
