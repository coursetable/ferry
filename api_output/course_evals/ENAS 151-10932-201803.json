            "\u00a0I think the structure of the class was nice and the work load was manageable; however, it felt as though we were rushing into many new topics towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0It was overall a pretty good course with good teaching and problem sets, but the pre-class quizzes were not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: So many opportunities to get help, great textbook, engaging class, fun topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets could be a tad easier. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the pace of the course and because of Prof. Ozolins's teaching method, much of the learning is done outside of the classroom (i.e. lots and lots of textbook reading). I wish there was a better and less grueling way to learn the material ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness of this course was the design of the lecture. The lectures were not very engaging, and many times, they were hard to follow. Frequently, the class would have to stop Professor Ozolins to have him repeat a point or show all his work and mental steps that he took in solving an example problem. I wish that the lectures could have been better structured to add more clarity. The strength of this course was the workload and the grading system. The quizzes and the problem sets were perfectly designed to help us understand the concepts that we were learning and how to apply them without overwhelming us with work. The grading system allowed us to make mistakes on some assignments and still do well in the course if we improved upon our errors. ",
            "\u00a0This class is taught so much better than MATH 120. The material is presented in the same logical order as the textbook allowing for connections to be made between each new section and the older ones. The course was also very fair in preparing students for the exams. Numerous different practice exams were provided on Canvas, allowing me to get a good understanding of how the questions are worded. The exams themselves are noncumulative and focus on the topics corresponding to their respective chapters. Because of this, the course really challenged me to not only understand how the theorems are used, but to also be able to connect their applications to other theorems. The problem sets were also worth doing as they provided good practice for the exams. Overall, a very fair and rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small class; good pace; tests are reasonably difficult and definitely test what we learn in class\r\nWeaknesses: flipped classroom\r\n\r\nThere should be more of a focus on doing example problems rather than the derivations. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe lectures could teach something. Maybe not quizzing students on the topics before they're taught in the lectures. Maybe make the pets and tests doable. ",
            "\u00a0It is strong because it does give a more applied approach to multivariable calculus in the sense that they give you equations and you apply them to problems rather than just doing proofs; however, this course was not smaller than Math 120 courses, the professor was okay most of the time, and sometimes great and sometimes bad, and a lot of independent learning was required. ",
            "\u00a0It moved very quickly, so there was a lot of self teaching involved. However by the end I did feel pretty confident on all the topics. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved if more emphasis was put on examples rather than proofs when learning concepts.  Also if professor office hours were more accessible to all students, learning concepts would be a bit easier. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of material available to study for each exam, which helps tremendously if you do them. However, we still had psets due the day before exams and doing them didn't guarantee success. The grading is a blessing, especially since the three lowest psets are dropped and each exam in noncumulative. be ready to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the material is explained in great depth, other than the last unit when it felt rushed. The weakness of this in-depth explanation is that the professor often spent time proving theorems whose proofs we did not need to know, leading to added confusion on what material we were responsible for. ",
            "\u00a0Vidvuds is a great professor. He's so witty and relatable in the classroom, and he is very helpful in office hours. The TFs are also extremely helpful, and they also have study hall hours which is a nice way to bond with the class too. \r\nI was confused leaving most of the classes, but that got cleared up after watching some youTube videos. ",
            "\u00a0Moved at a slightly high pace, I felt that Green's/Stokes'/Divergence theorems were not taught well - content was derived from a proof, but I never received a solid explanation for when to use each theorem and had to learn how to use them from the book/problem sets, as opposed to the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught and highly organized. No complaints. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very frustrating for me because I felt like it was catered toward people who have already taken multivariable calculus before and had at least seen the majority of the concepts we discussed (which was definitely not a prerequisite for the course). The pace and the way things were explained was not conducive to someone like me who had just finished calc II (i.e. AP calculus BC) in high school. I did quite well in that class and have enjoyed math, but I left this class feeling generally incompetent and stupid for not being able to catch onto things as quickly as people who were more familiar with the material. Because I felt like I was always needing to catch up, I rarely found enjoyment in the work and struggled just to get through the PSET every week. This is because I had to re-read everything on my own after class, not having time to process everything that was said during class and therefore having a lack of understanding. Our prof would often say things like obviously this is what you should do or this is very simple about things that were definitely not simple or obvious. I talked with several of my classmates who had the same frustration. But this kind of attitude from a prof made me feel discouraged from asking questions about things that were supposed to be obvious and simple. I think this class would be exponentially better if our prof approached the class as if we had never seen the concepts beforebecause many of us hadnt and I was placed into this level of math by Yale College. I think the level of stress and outside work I had to do for this class, compared to the amount that I actually grasped in class, was unfair and probably the most stressful part of my college experience this semester. ",
            "\u00a0the course just moves at a fast pace in general, which can be a challenge sometimes when moving through difficult topics. But I did appreciate how we did have a buffer at the end of the semester from when we stopped learning new material and when reading week / studying for finals began ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that the material was taught via lecture and writing on a chalkboard as opposed to just reading lecture slides which helped the students learn better. Another strength is that the Professor brought humor into the course making it very enjoyable. One weakness is that not many engineering applications were taught for how to apply the math being learned. Another was that there was never enough time in class to do all the examples the students and professor would have liked to do. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that I believe the class covered all the material necessary and there are very helpful study sessions twice a week. With that some weaknesses are that the engagement was often minimal in class and sometimes some topics seemed to be rushed. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend! Prof Ozolins is a good professor, although he does move through material VERY quickly. If you don't already have a pretty thorough understanding of the topics before the lecture, it's extremely difficult to know what's going on during class. This means that a lot of the learning requires you to read a textbook from cover to cover, which is never fun. \r\nIf you put in the effort, you will love Prof Ozolins (he's an incredibly interesting guy and has an awesome sense of humor). If you don't, then you probably won't. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for engineering students needing to take a multivariable calculus course. The material is presented in a more straightforward way than MATH 120 and the problem sets and practice exams do a much better job at preparing students for the exams. Additionally, the intimate setting of having only one section allows one to better get to know the other students in the class. In comparison to MATH 120, I was quickly able to form a study group with others. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you take it with the right professor. As much as I love Vidvuds Ozolins, if you are someone who needs good explaining, he isn't your guy. The other professor who teaches this, I hear, is quite good though. Still worth taking if you feel comfortable with independent learning. ",

I did below the average on my first two exams and did relatively better on the final and ended with a much better grade than I would've in 120. The exams are each weighed differently, depending on how you do relative to the other ones and the psets are also very generously weighed. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course - it teaches multivariable calculus very well to those who do not particularly prioritize a proof-based education. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. WAY better than math 120. Much better teaching, more skill-oriented mindset. The only thing is that it meets during reading period and the pace of work is a bit relentless. Would recommend though, you learn a lot and it's more manageable than math 120. Also Professor Ozolins is awesome! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS OVER MATH 120!!! As someone who took both MATH 120 (and did horribly) and this class (and did well), I would strongly recommend this class. First of all, Vidvuds is an amazing professor who is good at teaching, makes himself available, and is also generally a fun person to learn from. Also, the material is much easier to grasp in this class and the fact that you get a formula sheet during exams makes it so much better than MATH 120, which makes you memorize tedious formulae. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not for the frustrations I had as stated above. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for students which have a strong interest in engineering, and a background in physics. I had never taken a physics class, even in high school, and definitely struggled to keep up a lot in this course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes because it teaches topics that multivriable calculus in high school doesnt teach and is a very informative class that engineering students need to form the bedrock foundation of their knowledge as they proceed forward with their studies. ",
