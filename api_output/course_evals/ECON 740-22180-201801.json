            "\u00a0The course can be characterized as a series of fruitful discussions with the class on our replication studies on the climate impacts literature, direct feedback from professors Mendelsohn and Nordhaus, and lots of independent problem solving/research experience. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of climate change economics, and much better understanding of the methods and pitfalls of economics research papers ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic course in climate change economics with two of the defining figures in the field, be sure you understand the project of Econ 740. Basically, the course and its first-semester equivalent (Econ 739) assign a year-long investigation into a particular area of evaluating climate change impacts. This usually involves the close examination of a major research paper, from which a Econ 740 student pair will reproduce and replicate the results, re-consider every aspect of the original economist's argument, and develop new directions for evaluating the relevant impact. In the case of flawed or mis-understood papers, the students offer corrections, reformed results, and potentially contributions to the field. (Final papers may be considered for collective publication in some years.) Do not be mistaken in thinking this is a generalist course or a course into the broad scope of climate change economics; moreover, it is not a course in exploring generic methods and literature. Instead, it is a very deep dive around a particular work and all the economics, econometrics, and intricacies therein. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the climate change literature, some best practices in econometrics, and more about the programming techniques used in writing an actual paper. "

            "\u00a0See internal feedback forms ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--independent work with direct applications to graduate school and future economics research. \r\nWeaknesses--more lecture and methods teaching would have improved overall understanding and learning ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the ability to rigorously examine a particular aspect or paper in climate change economics with two of the field's finest minds. (Indeed, one of the absolute best qualities of the course is the interaction of Professors Mendelsohn and Nordhaus.) The course develops around this special project. The weaknesses might be that, especially early in the course (perhaps back in Econ 739), there might be need for greater framing and context. Some of the most useful seminars involved lecturing on methods and general approaches taken by the literature. I think then some more lecturing would only improve the main thrust of dissecting, then recreating and improving a major climate change economics paper. ",
            "\u00a0Could have been more organized with clearer deadlines and expectations. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but with a very crucial qualification. This is a singular opportunity to work with Mendelsohn and Nordhaus, but you must understand what you are signing up for. It is more a colloquium-style course that gives a sense of how to work with a major paper; it has much the more feel of a research working group (and a very rigorous one at that) then the usual seminar. For most undergraduates, this would be well outside expectation. In short, undergraduates should consider taking this rare opportunity if (a) they are assured of having the requisite experience especially in econometrics (which will not be provided during the course) and (b) what the graduate school experience of journal-worthy paper work. But be bold-- give it a shot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great to hear Mendelsohn and Nordhaus's perspective on the climate change literature and learn this literature in a more in-depth way- actually programming the results. "
