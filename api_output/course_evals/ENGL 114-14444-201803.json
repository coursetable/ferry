            "\u00a0I developed skills in writing, analyzing written works, citing different sources, and elaborating in my english language. I also developed skills in communicating with my professor and classmates, as well as working in groups, collaborating for group activities or projects, and presenting to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Even if it isn't this specific section, I would 100% recommend taking an ENGL 114 course during your first semester as a first-year. I learned so much about writing in college, and this didn't involve smothering my own voice as well. The professor works with you on technicalities of writing an argumentative paper or a research paper, for example, and at the same time gives you enough freedom to find your voice amidst these technicalities. Plus, the subject of family is so interesting I learned not only about how family defines me but how I define family, specifically how my environment and the world in which I grew up has shaped my conception of family. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like in this class I truly improved as a writer and, at the same time, I really got to learn about other students' families and cultures, because of the topic. Also, Professor Coleman is great about connecting us with a lot of resources within the Center for Teaching and Learning and beyond (like that one class we had volunteering at New Haven Reads, reading to kids). ",
            "\u00a0I think that I learned a lot about constructing an argument for an essay. I think that in the past I have struggled creating a concrete argument and the this course has lead to become more confident in this procedure. I think that quantity of writing and the way the class was structured forced me to practice my writing skills until I became a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0My writing and drafting process strongly improved!!!!! We also delved really deep into the definition of a family and what that means for each of us. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze various types of writing and use them as sources for my own writing. I was able to develop my own skills to describe and support my arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Practice writing a variety of different kinds of essays, personal, analytical and research based. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop my research skills significantly. The experience that I obtained through the various assignments is invaluable! I feel much more confident when crafting papers, and I will definitely use this knowledge in future courses. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great way to start off my first semester at Yale because it really helped me with my academic writing. I was already a fairly clear writer, but this class pushed me to make more bold claims with less predictable arguments. "

            "\u00a0The professor is amazing. She is so eager to work one-on-one with all of her students, and she is always willing to explain instructions to assignments or how she graded a certain assignment. Her teaching style, as she mentions herself, is very dependent on the students, so she tries to get the students to lead the discussion after she opens it up. The only weakness is that the course only lasts for a semester! I would really love to do more readings related to the topic of family. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how we had deadlines for a full draft (ungraded) before the final draft, because it really kept me on track. One thing I felt like I really learned to do, as a result of that, was editing and revising. I did some of that in high school, but never on the scale that I learned to do it in this class. Professor Coleman also has us read passages from Booth's \"The Craft of Research\" and it was surprisingly very helpful. Also, I learned to really enjoy the weekly course blog, because most students end up writing about their own families, and it is incredibly enlightening to hear the stories from your classmates of where they come from. \r\nOne thing that I personally struggled with was the paper where we connected two very different pieces of media, a photograph and a piece of writing, that were not intrinsically related themselves. I did wish that we were given some more freedom with choice of evidence, because I felt the connection I wrote about in my paper was a bit forced. I found it difficult to make a central claim and put the two \"in conversation.\" One thing that really helped was Professor Coleman's feedback on my initial draft and going to the writing tutor at the CTL to rework my paper. The resources here can really help with the challenges of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think a big strength of the course is professor Coleman who is a very engaging and thoughtful professor. I also think the structure of the course is excellent; I would not change it at all.  I think the weaknesses were the topic given that there really is no concrete answer to the question what makes a family and it is entirely subjective. Additionally, I think that there needs to be more feedback given on the assignments even if they receive good grades: writing can always be better. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course so I can't think of many weaknesses.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Prof Coleman stressed the importance of the writing tutors and she was also very approachable (we had one on one meetings with her). We also would have draft deadlines and she would give notes on the drafts and we'd also have class workshops. All of these were super useful to my writing. We discussed for a lot of our classes and we had a weekly blog post that would begin the discussion of what a family is. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing class with an intriguing topic that was great to write about. The biggest weakness would just be that it goes a bit fast so the writing assignments dont have too much time between when they start and end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor was very engaged in the material and chose pretty good readings that related to the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Conversation was sometimes stagnant, I think having more defined topics of discussion might have helped. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really good at teaching the basics of how to craft an academic paper. If you do not feel confident in your writing skills, this is definitely the course for you. One downside is that you do not get to peer review your essays as much as would be ideal. Maybe one or two of your papers may be peer reviewed or just a few paragraphs. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the clear deadlines, the manageable workload, and the emphasis on improving writing. The blog posts were fun at first, but they got pretty repetitive by the end of the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it was very informative in improving my writing skills, as well as very intellectually engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely yes! Having draft deadlines that weren't graded help you in setting your own deadlines for essays in other classes. And because there is so much leeway in what you can write about, I felt that I was able to bring in a lot of what I was learning in my other classes and either talk about it during class or write about it in my essays. But because the topic is so broad, the class really depends on how much the students engage with it. Overall, I would recommend taking an ENGL 114 course during your first year, even if it is not specifically this topic. But if you want an engaging and challenging but chill course about something interesting, then definitely consider this section. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I especially that the topic of family is especially relevant for us as students in college, moving away from our families for an extended period of time, and getting to reflect on the background we came from. I love that I got to learn about where my classmates came from in our blog post discussions at the beginning of class. Moreover, the assignments were spaced out enough to give us time to really work on our writing and the units were organized really well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great first writing course at Yale, and Professor Coleman is a good professor to have. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! My writing process has changed completely for the better. There's so much less stress associated with essay writing now. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor Coleman was amazing and organized a class that I know helped my writing, was intriguing, and made me look forward to discussing every time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provides good practice writing and isn't too much work or too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It helped me get over my fear of articles and research in general. It is still a daunting task, but I know that I am much better equipped to craft a great research paper. Overall, the course was very interesting! I am definitely much more cognizant of the value that family brings to my life, and I have never been more grateful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Coleman really cares about her students, the course is very well organized with clear deadlines (and rough drafts to make the deadlines less stressful), and the topic of family was very interesting and applicable.
