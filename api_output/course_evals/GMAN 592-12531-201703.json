            "\u00a0Very well structured course for closely analyzing films; light reading load, but high level discussion ",
            "\u00a0I got a much better grounding in not only Fassbinder's and Herzog's careers, but in German film more broadly. We didn't talk much about Haneke's relationship to Austrian cinema, but perhaps he's working more in the Franco-German mode. I definitely developed the skill of better articulating my ideas--Brigitte really engages with student comments in class discussion, and she does not hesitate to disagree with students or reformulate their contributions. I received many insights into the work of these filmmakers--and European cinema more generally--but all of those insights are open to revision. Brigitte shared her interpretations without insisting that they were conclusive. ",

            "\u00a0The format of the course worked very well. Each session was lead by Brigitte in collaboration with another student who responded to the readings and discussed the film with the help of clips. The conversations developed organically, but were always sustained at a high level of discourse, while engaging with the nitty gritty of each film's narrative and visual style. The readings were almost all very good, and the amount of reading was very, very reasonable. We managed to engage the readings in class without allowing them to dominate our discussions. My only concern about the course is that some of the questions Brigitte asks are very complicated and specific. This might alienate some of the students who don't have a lot of experience discussing film in an aesthetic, theoretical, philosophical, or technical way. About one third of the class never or almost never participated in class discussion, but this may have been due to shyness rather than the types of questions being asked. ",

            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course to any student interested in film or art history. Professor Peucker structures her course around the films by means of close, in-class textual analysis. Very productive for both graduate and upper level undergraduate film students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The format is ideal for a film studies course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very helpful introduction of three interesting German/Austrian directors "
