            "\u00a0You get good at holding complicated themes and threads in mind as you read long works and bodies of work. There's something amazing about diving deep for several months into one person's work  you start to gain an appreciation for the interplay between a person's life and the thoughts they have. ",
            "\u00a0Writing and critical reading somewhat improved ",
            "\u00a0I become more skilled at reading, interpreting, and analyzing poetry. I developed an appreciation for the life and impact of John Milton. I broadened my knowledge of Christian theology, and acquired an interest in religious study. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the poetry, politics, and thought of John Milton. I also thought a lot about how to engage with a writer from a historical perspective, since that was definitely an important part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Since I initially only signed up for this course to fulfill the pre-1800 requirement, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this course. You write two essays and take an exam, so it's overall not a difficult course, but I learned a lot more about Milton's historical and literary context. ",
            "\u00a0Milton was at once a challenging course and one that provided a driven and distinct insight into many of the John Milton's major works and less known works.  If you are taking the course after ENGL 126, it can provide a more nuanced and specific focus on Milton, both of his life and oeuvre. Fascinating class in general. "

            "\u00a0John Rogers is a kick-ass professor, and the Teaching Fellows were awesome. I think a major strength of the course lies in the teaching team's high expectations of us students. We're expected to show up to lecture and section having put a lot of thought into the reading we've done, and so discussions happen at a pretty high level. You feel like you're being trusted with big ideas and encouraged to make intellectual leaps that make you appreciate the texts even more. ",
            "\u00a0Magnificent course! If not the greatest poet in English (almost though!), his corpus lends itself better than Shakespeare to a semester of study. Changed my life lol. Insightful, dense, ingeniously structured lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course complete with incredible lectures, fantastic readings, and helpful TA's. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. John Rogers is a phenomenal lecturer, and his bold claims are highly engaging. The only weakness with the course is that it has both a final and a final paper, which is a little bit overwhelming. I would rather have a second, longer paper that is due sometime during the last two weeks of class perhaps. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly it was really great, I wouldn't change much. As someone whose only experience reading Milton was Paradise Lost, this was a great survey of his work. "

            "\u00a0This has got to be one of the best literature classes offered at Yale. Every lecture, you come out with a new reverence towards the texts you read. You laugh a lot and get much better at reading complex works of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Rogers is an outstanding lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am a graduating senior History major and I can say with certainty that this is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Professor Rogers is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would if they wanted to engage with Miltons work.  Professor Rogers is also a lovey lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Magnificent course! If not the greatest poet in English (almost though!), his corpus lends itself better than Shakespeare to a semester of study. Changed my life lol. Insightful, dense, ingeniously structured lectures. ",
            "\u00a0YES! It was one of the best courses I've taken here. I found the lectures mind-blowing and the readings really engaging. John Rogers is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE. The class is a phenomenally engaging analysis of John Milton and his beautiful and shocking poetry. John Rogers makes bold claims every lecture that engage his students at the highest level. You will leave the course with a sense of the truly radical nature of Milton, and the profound effect he has had on literature, politics, and even religion. \r\nIt also isn't that difficult  a normal amount of reading (25-40 pages per class, twice a week), section (with brief 150 word reading responses), two papers (5-7 pages, and 6-8 pages) and a final (quote IDs and essay). The only downside, in my opinion, is that there is both a final paper and a final. \r\nIf you haven't read Paradise Lost before, it will be a bit of a whirlwind, since Rogers doesn't spend as much time on the more basic things have to do with the poem, but I would absolutely recommend taking it no matter your level of experience with his poetry. You will spend about 5-6 weeks on PL, but then also read some of Milton's other (mostly) incredible poetry. My section was fantastic, with a thoughtful and engaging TF (David DeLeon). It was also small, which made for flowing, energetic discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Take it even if you don't think you're interested in Milton! Professor Rogers is great and makes it seem relevant. Obviously if you don't do the readings it won't be interesting, but the workload is totally manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Milton was at once a challenging course and one that provided a driven and distinct insight into many of the John Milton's major works and less known works.  If you are taking the course after ENGL 126, it can provide a more nuanced and specific focus on Milton, both of his life and oeuvre. Fascinating class in general. "
