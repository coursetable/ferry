It gave me a great insight into how and why certain diseases present themselves and how we can treat them. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about some of the common afflictions of to different organ systems; how and why they develop, common and emergent treatments, some of the history (med/research). This felt like a preliminary outline of the shape some courses in medical school might take. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the mechanism of pathogenesis of various diseases, with focus on blood-related, kidney, and neural diseases. I gained insight into the qualitative observations made from tissue slides that contribute to diagnosis and aid the doctor in predicting the prognosis of a disease. ",

            "\u00a0Some of the lectures are kind of disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses are that it is taught by different lecturers for each unit, so each teaching style is different. Also, it is not a comprehensive introduction, it only covers 3-4 areas of pathology. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the different lecturers and how knowledgeable they were in their fields. It was definitely a strength to learn it from the individuals who see these types of cases every single day. Sometimes their lectures were a little bit too dense, but the exams were never really too bad so it was overall a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the material itself and section, but weaknesses was the presentation of the material. Most of the professors taught far too fast and at a level that made it difficult to understand the first time. It could be improved by providing clear, organized notes and slowing down the lectures a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the course went in-depth, and how the lecturers were knowledgable and passionate about the material. Kavita was one of the main strengths of the class. She was a fantastic TA. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: non-cumulative exams \r\nweaknesses: each module is taught by a different professor so some are better taught than others ",
            "\u00a0I thought the expectations of the professors varied wildly when it came to tests. I think they should have to collaborate more and make themes from the first section more apparent in disease processes of the next four. I also believe that it is better to learn from simple slides with many examples than endless amounts of texts which do the job of lecturing. That's just a personal opinion though. \r\n\r\nI also think the amount of information that we have to learn is vast and it was rare for a professor to be clear about what was important to test on, and what were cool details about research they have been apart of. The differentiation is important as students studying for a test, but I understand that professors are trying to inspire future academicians and researchers.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the first section of the class had handouts to go with each lecture. Future sections did not do that. Future sections should make concise handouts of the same quality because they're very useful for learning. ",
            "\u00a0General pathobiology was well taught, with clear content outlines and organization. Other sections were also well done. Sometimes it was not clear to what depth the material might appear on the exam in other sections.\r\n Far and away my TA was the foremost strength of the course, she presented concise and engaging outlines of the content and was extremely responsive to student questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its outstanding Yale School of Medicine professors (who are also practicing doctors) and its emphasis on providing pre-meds with a detailed understanding of topics relevant to medical school. A weakness of this course is its partitioning into five sections, each of which is taught by a different professor, which makes the class feel a bit disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0The review sessions are a huge help to the course. It would help to perhaps save some time to synthesize all the info in a given module. ",

            "\u00a0More consistency from professor to professor ",
            "\u00a0I like the set up of this class and how we can get professors from different departments and fields to teach each section, but it is a little disorganized and communication is often dependent on the TA and not the professors. ",

            "\u00a0If you are Pre-med, you need to take this class. This is all the stuff you will be learning in med school at some point anyways and it can really give you a sense if you are actually passionate about it. It is easier than almost all MCDB classes I have taken here and very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in medicine, pubic health or a related field, this is a really cool way to apply your biology knowledge to something super tangible and interesting. Be prepared to feel overwhelmed in class and then put in a lot of work studying for the exams. But the TAs are super helpful and if you study, the exams themselves are not that bad. Definitely not hard to do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a pre-med it was very interesting to get my feet wet by taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Be prepared to learn a lot of information (do not skip lecture). You won't have that many notes (the first section's handouts were amazing though). Time management is huge, go to section, if Kavita could continue teaching section forever you'd be so set. ",
            "\u00a0Take this if youre interested in becoming a doctor / medical research scientist and want an interesting/relevant course! While the exams are frequent they dont individually cover an extensive amount of material, so you should be able to have a fairly thorough understanding of each section. Also, my TA (Kavita) was one of the best Ive had in my four years at Yale, if shes TAing for this course your year try and get her section! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, my favorite MCDB course so far. It was interesting and the different sections kept you on your toes. The exams were fairly often but besides that there was no work, so show up to class, which I know can be hard, but lecture is actually interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, fantastic class with fantastic teachers. Not too much of a workload; I definitely got the sense that the purpose of the course was to drum up interest in some fields of biology/medicine that aren't talked about much in other classes. "
