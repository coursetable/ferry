            "\u00a0The most valuable skill I acquired was developing a research paper. Though there was not an incredible amount of structure as to how we should go about writing our cumulative essays, I learned how to use Yale's resources and better integrate these sources into a cohesive argument. ",
            "\u00a0- Haitian history\r\n- Writing at the College Level\r\n- Sustainability ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned how to better understand a culture different than my own and additionally more about the history, daily life, political problems, and sustainable development possibilities for the future of Haiti. Moreover, I was able to learn about how to effectively write a college research paper and further develop an interest of mine by relating it to Haiti and doing research regarding it.  Lastly, I developed more confidence in my speaking skills (given that daily each person had to speak in front of peers in the seminar style course and give a presentation), better writing skills (through short papers and our final research paper), and how to teach a class (since each student had one topic to lead one of the seminar classes on). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to lead a presentation and participate more in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Haiti. I also learned some facets of Haitian culture as well as the struggles the country is going through, though I don't feel that I can really picture a typical Haitian's way of life.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of foreign aid improved, and I feel that I can more critically look at aid efforts toward any developing nation. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to gain a better understanding of Haiti from historical and cultural perspectives. We had several discussions of the complexity of both past and present relations between developing and developed countries, and how the legacy of colonialism has impacted culture and zeitgeist.  The course also gave me insight into college-level research paper writing as a First Year. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new knowledge about Haiti and Haitian culture and learned interesting things about many different parts of Haitian life. The individual research that students did was very helpful for me and it really created a stimulating learning environment that I believe benefited everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Haitian history, current events, culture, and values. I also learned valuable writing skills, as well as speaking skills throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of Haitis history that helps put its current state into perspective ",
            "\u00a0This class helped develop how I think about aiding developing countries in general. Through the weekly discussions, I learned more of the nuances around aiding a nation like Haiti. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course encouraged active participation in discussions, and we were able to formulate an idea of what life is like in Haiti. However, we used very few first-hand sources, and therefore our image of the nation and the way of life there may be tainted. This is hard to circumvent, however, without actually traveling there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Student-centered\r\n- Discussion-based\r\n- Talking to \"real\" Haitians, like Ralph and Gary\r\n-Classroom culture \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- None ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include the quantity of knowledge learned about Haiti and college life in general (such as writing papers and speaking and presenting).  Another strength is how kind and understanding Professor Geballe is to issues that come up in life that may conflict with coursework. \r\nWeaknesses of this course include the rush to read the history novel and fiction novel (although the second is much shorter).  Overall, though, there are not really any weaknesses, as the course is really set up to see students succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The amount you learn depends of how much research is done by the student leading the discussion, which has its strengths and weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the guest speakers and diversity of classmates were strengths of this course that exposed me to perspectives that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the format of students leading seminar discussion. Our discussions never probed deep enough that I felt that the seminar style really aided my learning. I never did many of the student-assigned readings because I was skeptical that they aided my learning, I rarely saw them incorporated into class discussion, and I worried that students were just choosing sources so they could fulfill the requirement of doing so. I know that, as a first year course, this class is meant to teach us how to engage in material in new ways, and leading discussions certainly does that. I just feel that, for every student not in charge of leading a discussion on a given day, more direction from the professor may be to their benefit.\r\n\r\nConversely, I was most engaged during the history portion of the course. The Dubois book that Professor Geballe chose was very interesting, and I really felt my knowledge expand during this more-structured period of the course. I was actually surprised by getting excited in history for the first time in my life! A focus on modern implications made the past much more interesting.\r\n\r\nI feel that titling the course \"sustainable development\" is misleading. Despite the concept of \"sustainable development\" encompassing more than the environment, I believe the common association with the term is environmental, leading many of my classmates to enroll expecting environmental sustainability to be the focus of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course did not aim to teach us the entire history of Haiti. Rather, it gave my peers and I the flexibility to explore different concepts within Haiti's complex and vibrant history to gain insight into the present. This flexibility allowed for fascinating discussions of the present and even future of Haiti. \r\nI do think that the course could benefit from more discussions with people who have direct experience growing up in Haiti. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the only weaknesses were that there could've been a little more direction with the prompts of the paper. I believe the strengths were in the independence and individualism of the learning, which was really cool to have. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interactive. I never felt bored. We were always talking and discussing different events, including debates etc. I also learned so much about writing and the course was designed to emphasize revision and reflection. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was student led and discussion focused. The course is a bit misleading because the class is focused on the history of Haiti so it would be nice to include more elements that focus on sustainable development because thats why I was interested in the class. There wasnt enough constructive commentary on the papers to support the claim on the syllabus that everyone will become a better writer. The comments on my paper were always only about proper citations and not using the word it ",
            "\u00a0I thought the weekly discussions were good at getting us to think critically at how a nation like Haiti should be helped. However, sometimes the discussions got really reptetive. It isnt as deep of a dive into how to development as I wouldve liked, but it was a good introduction. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to incoming first years. Professor Geballe promotes the idea of focusing on your passions, with an example being the final research paper. I was able to choose a topic that I found interesting, and further analyze its implications in Haiti, as well as in the developing world in general. This course is a fantastic transition into Yale, and exposes students to the resources available on campus, as well as the broad, recurring skills needed for success here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good introduction to Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to others, as it really helped me develop both in knowledge of the course material and in personal college and life skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very helpful in learning about Haiti. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking for an easy A. I would also recommend this class to students who are interested in the modern consequences of history. Lastly, I would recommend this class to someone looking to learn more about Haiti. Although there are areas for this course to improve in this regard, I did see my knowledge of this country and my perspective on its current state of underdevelopment broaden.\r\n\r\nI would hesitate to recommend this course to anyone looking to seriously engage in the topic of sustainable development, for I don't feel that my knowledge on this topic improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Initially, I picked the course just because I wanted to discuss sustainable development. However, in learning more about the history of Haiti, I think that everyone should strive to learn more about it, in order to better understand the lasting impacts of relations between states, the importance of environmental justice, as well as religion and its role in social life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It is a great introduction to the seminar format and just to Yale in general. It is really cool to have a small circle of interested learners, which is what Yale is all about. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the course was so interesting and engaging, and it taught me many great skills. A great transition to college as a first-year. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in gaining more knowledge about Haitis history and arent taking the class because they want to improve their writing ",
            "\u00a0I personally took it because I am interested in economic development in struggling countries and felt that this class was a decent introduction into thinking critically about this issue. However, I dont think it was anything profound or eye opening and would recommend shopping it to see if it really excites you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A great start to my Yale career. Gordon always gave timely insightful feedback and the course material was thoroughly engaging. "
