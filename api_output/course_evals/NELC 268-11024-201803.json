            "\u00a0as the title suggests, i had assumed this class would be an overview of global environmental patterns, laws, movements, etc. throughout history. instead we talked about agriculture in ancient mesopotamia for the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class was not well organized. It would have been beneficial if we had received more material. A strength would be the passion of the Professor who did everything in his power to show us the importance of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a real grab bag. Certain lectures are clear and relate well to the materials, while others follow from nowhere and don't relate to the overall narrative of the course (specifically the transition from feudalism to capitalism). When the lectures are on topic, the course is fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Weiss is a very good and knowledgeable lecture and a lot can be learned from him. However, this class was not about global environmental history and should not be a core course of the environmental studies major. It was about mesopotamian agricultural history and various societal collapses due to megadrought, which seems to mirror Weiss' other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Kind of a weird class but it was sort of interesting by the end. Professor Weiss has a funky way of lecturing that involves him just asking a ton of rhetorical questions. I would say the essence of the class is that there was a drought, farming failed, and people habitat tracked. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: assessments are relatively straightforward and the workload is low - a lecture with no sections and readings completely optional (I never did any and still did well for all my exams and assignments just by going to lecture). Prof Weiss is a nice guy who is really passionate about his work and the class and can be quite funny. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the material to be really disorganized especially towards the end of semester. It was alright for the first half of the class before the midterm because Prof Weiss really knows the content well, but the second half of the class was so confusing. Topics seemed disjointed (e.g. one lecture would have slides jumping from medieval climate anomaly to the intensification of agriculture to the transition from feudalism to capitalism?) and Prof Weiss didnt smoothly connect between topics, making lecture + studying for the final really confusing (and yes I paid attention during lecture, wasnt using my phone or anything!) Everything also wasnt in chronological order so even doubly hard to follow. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, he just chucks a bunch of words up to the powerpoint (entire paragraphs copied and pasted from journal articles) which makes it hard to study because you dont know which are the key points, and this is from someone who goes to lecture. Didnt really make me excited to go to class at 9am up on science hill. ",
            "\u00a0Could be better organized, especially when giving directions ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the semester was very interesting. The second half of the course got a little confusing and shifted mainly to bashing on capitalism and many of the arguments the professor presented were very unsubstantiated and highly controversial. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very straightforward class, and I think that made it excellent in achieving its goal. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was very thorough and powerpoint presentations were made accessible to students. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of potential--heck, it's the history of the world!--but it really, really fell flat. Weiss spent far too much time on ancient Mesopotamia and his own archaeological findings, and not enough time on other parts of the world. I think a world map appeared a total of six times throughout the semester. The lectures were highly unorganized and were mostly tangents that Weiss went on about the synchronicity of societal collapse with environmental change. Don't get me wrong, that is important, but it would have been so much more interesting had we had compared the transition of feudalism to capitalism in Europe to say, China. But no, we only talked about Europe and the 19th century theories behind our concepts. ",
            "\u00a0There were no strengths. The course was extremely disorganized, confusing, and badly run. The first half revolved around one small time period in ancient Mesopotamia, but the second half jumped around obscurely to random time periods such as WWI. It was so bizarre. There were 6 parts of the world identified as having importantly early civilizations, but we only talked about Egypt and Mesopotamia, and barely touched on Latin America. It was easily the worst course I've taken at Yale. This was confounded by having the absolute worst TA I have ever had in my time at Yale. Vivian was extraordinarily condescending, unhelpful, and made it exceedingly difficult to ask questions or schedule office hours with her. She also put out instructions that consistently contradicted those of Prof Weiss, which made assignments extraordinarily confusing. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture could be a bit boring, especially since it was a trek up to Kroon at 9 am, but it took me until the end of the course to realize how everything he taught tied in together. Essentially you just have to know that megadroughts led to collapses, and the strength of the course is all the tidbits of knowledge you gain that you can interject into conversation or help in other courses.

Also because realizing that you are nothing more than surplus keeps things real and can be quite humbling. ",
            "\u00a0Please do not take this class. I'm sorry to all of the EVST majors who might have to take it for a Group A requirement, and it doesn't have much of a workload at least, but for me it didn't even feel worth it to take a gut class like this because the content was so skewed. ",

Understanding how human societies have adapted to climate changes is very important as we move into the 21st century, and this class provides that in a format/workload that is easy to deal with as a 5th class.
