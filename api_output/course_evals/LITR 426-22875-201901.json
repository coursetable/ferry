            "\u00a0A survey of a lot different key feminist and queer theoretical works across intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0As regards skills, this class focused on close reading. It was helpful to have this skill actively engaged in the classroom setting, though arguably this kind of skill should be taught in first-year rather than in a junior seminar. I learned a lot about whitestream US feminism from the 1890s to the 1980s, but relatively little else. ",
            "\u00a0I know more about feminism and queer theory! I've gained the vocabulary to engage in these debates and to do further reading. understand the different waves of feminism and why the wave model is problematic, understand the different strands of feminist and queer organizing, different projects and perspectives within feminist and queer theory. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a solid background knowledge of Feminist and Queer Theory which I can now build upon with more specific, in depth studies. I also have the framework and language to understand my other studies (literature, writing, art) through a queer, feminist lens. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the structure of seminar, how it was incredibly engaging and always invited student participation. It was also the perfect amount of weekly reading in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None :) ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus incorporated a range of texts with various tones, which was a definite strength. Reading primary sources was unusual, and I found it helpful thinking about thesis preparation. However, my main critique is that this class's syllabus was so focused on white feminist history in the US. We spent very little time on queer theory, and trans theory was thrown in for a week. This glossing is an issue with every survey course, but having only one week and selections from one book on women of color feminisms is a dramatic whitewashing of feminist and queer history. Each branch of feminism has a rich and complicated history rife with internal differences and nuances, but this course really glossed over those nuances particularly when it comes to the works of feminists of color, even though there are so many different types of women of color feminisms across time, each of which deserves at least the time we spent on white feminisms. Also, why read Freud *again* in a junior seminar in WGSS? ",
            "\u00a0Great discussions, super interesting readings! \r\nLots of reading though, and you need to do it in order to get a lot out of the class.\r\nBut, there are only a few informal reading responses that you have to do, which is nice. Only one midterm and one final paper. So lots of reading but not too bad on the assignments front. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion in this class was always extremely well facilitated and productive. I loved how collaborative the course was  I learned so much from my classmates as well as from Professor Richards. The readings were well chosen in the sense that they gave a solid historical overview of queer and feminist theory, although I do wish we'd read more by women of color/about women of color feminisms. Most of the authors we read were white. That said, I know that historically, theory has been very white, so maybe this is a historically realistic syllabus. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a really great introduction to a lot of different key feminist and queer theorists! ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course simply because the syllabus was so whitewashed but I hope that, as the class returns to in-house WGSS teaching, this will improve. The evolution of white US feminism is a legitimate field of study, so take this course with Prof Richards if you want to take that class, but not if you expect to learn about other topics. If you're a WGSS major, consider all the other materially grounded classes in the major before this one, which focuses a lot on abstract theory rather than theory grounded in material realities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you care at all about feminism, queerness, or intersectionality!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Jill is great and this is a great and engaging introduction to feminist and queer theory. Everyone was committed to the course and Prof. Richards facilitated great discussion ",
            "\u00a0Yep ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Having a background, language, and historical understanding of feminist and queer theory gives you the tools to experience the world you're living in and the life you lead. It can inform the way you think about everything. I learned so much! "
