            "\u00a0This course is really amazing for encouraging students to increase the volume of work that they are reading and exposed to in Chinese. I learned a lot of formal language, and my reading skills improved dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at reading Chinese articles and learned new vocabulary/idioms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of useful specialized vocab about certain topics like government, environment, and various social issues. I also was able to improve my speaking/presentation skills in Mandarin. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some major concerns in Chinese society, namely environmental damage, senior homes, male population surplus, and STDs in China. I also learned numerous idioms in Mandarin. I improved my ability to speak using more advanced vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more advanced essay-writing structures and idioms for Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0A better grasp of formal Chinese and deeper understanding of limited current issues in China. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very valuable insight into contemporary China, from the lens of well-chosen articles and insightful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: contemporary issues in Chinese society\r\nSkills: speed-reading and writing in a formal or literary style,\r\nInsights: this class confirmed my professional interests related to China! ",
            "\u00a0Improved reading skills a bit, through weekly readings. Learned some new vocabulary. Gleaned more knowledge about Chinese viewpoints on contemporary issues in society. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is very interactive, which is great for encouraging students to actually read the material learned, consider the topics, and then share their insights with the rest of the class- all in Chinese. It is a great class for promoting reading and thinking in mandarin. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting content (reading are all articles), engaged teacher, workload is what you make it - while you have to read a few articles before each class, you can usually skim for meaning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more English than your usual Chinese class (especially after a summer language pledge, it is a weird adjustment), not as much material covered ",
            "\u00a0The class teaches a lot about issues China is facing, but I wasn't super interested in some of them which made me feel that it was difficult to speak in class because I had very little to say. If the content were a bit more relevant to me, I would have spoken more. I also feel like opportunities to speak were less than what I had hoped. The daily vocabulary homework was helpful in a way, but it soon became more of a chore than a learning opportunity. The readings were a little too long at times. ",
            "\u00a0The homework is busy work that I would often do the morning of. Also, I wasn't called on very often for the daily quizzes, which negatively affects your grade. ",
            "\u00a0Zhou laoshi is extremely committed and a very generous teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Broader scope of topics (and perhaps more student freedom in picking topics to discuss). ",
            "\u00a0I can't speak highly enough of this course. The workload is manageable, and there is no busy work--everything contributes to language learning, which is more than I can say for other language classes I have taken. Discussion is interesting, and the topics are very well chosen. I feel like I understand issues facing China much better after this course, and can talk about them comfortably in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Zhou Laoshi was one of the most amazing and caring professors I've had at Yale. Through our reading list, Zhou Laoshi presented many perspectives on contemporary issues facing China, which I really appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses: If the class were smaller or if there had been TA's, I would have appreciated more detailed feedback on my presentations and essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings are taken from periodicals and are extremely relevant to contemporary Chinese society. Words used in readings are at the level necessary to communicate in China.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some units ran too long, so the topics got boring after a while. Perhaps think about packing in more topics. Overall, the readings were too easy. Every time I was making a vocabulary list, I struggled to find words that I did not know. I also found the homework to be \"busy work\" and less helpful. Perhaps thinking about how to make it more \"practicing\" rather than checking boxes. For next time, add some more difficult readings, perhaps academic papers as well. Although I appreciated having the NYT and foreign sources, there should be more readings from Chinese sources than American or other foreign sources. This will help to get a more authentic viewpoint.

            "\u00a0Yes- especially for students who are not only looking to improve their Chinese but also to learn more about current issues in Chinese society, this class is a great choice. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted a course where I could maintain my Chinese without having to put in large amounts of time, since I was taking 5 other classes. CHNS 167 fulfilled that goal. The workload in 167 is fairly low, especially compared to the 153 and 163 type classes. You don't learn as many core words, but you do become more comfortable with reading Chinese. The levels of students in the class vary a great deal, so Zhou LaoShi grades based on individual progress. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to those who have an advanced knowledge of Chinese and are interested in learning more about social issues in China. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student already has an advanced level of Chinese and is looking to bring more professional vocabulary into their vernacular. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- this is a must take. This directly prepares you for using Chinese in \"real-life,\" and teaches you how to study on your own--a valuable skill for after graduation. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! You'll gain deeper knowledge regarding contemporary Chinese issues, as well as a wide vocabulary and greater confidence to discuss these issues. The workload is very manageable, only 4-6 hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students wishing to use their Chinese in a practical way, to get experience reading and speaking, which is most important if you are looking to live and work in China. There is not so much emphasis on writing in this course, so if your goal is to improve writing, this is not the best choice. "
