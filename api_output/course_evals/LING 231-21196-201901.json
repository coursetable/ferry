            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the revised models of brain-language relations across several decades of history, and through this, learned a lot about linguistic theory and how the brain processes language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of neurolinguistics and how the theories about brain-language relations have developed since the 1970s. I have also learned about the parts of the brain associated with the brain's language faculty and how they affect the linguistic processing of people with brain injuries. ",
            "\u00a0I started this course not certain what I was going to learn in terms of subject matter. By the end I learned a lot about not only the potential structure of language but also about brain-language relations. It was difficult at times to grasp the difference between what is a (potentially) artificial linguistic framework, and what is meant by psychologically real - however the distinction was much more clear by the end, which was incredibly rewarding to realize.\r\nFurthermore, although the course's focus was on language, I feel that I have learned many approaches and tools to approach cognition as a whole, which was my intention in taking the course as a non-linguistics major. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a strong understanding of the history of neurolinguistics and the ways the field has evolved since the late 20th century. One of the ways it does this is by teaching several theories for how the brain handles language (mostly through the lens of aphasias) and making us compare and contrast the strong and weak points of the theories. The course also teaches how to look at a neurolinguistic study and gauge its value as a study. "

            "\u00a0I quite enjoyed the structure of the class in that it was an almost-chronological exploration of the ever-changing brain-language model. I enjoyed that we tackled the material head-on by reading only the primary research articles (there was no baby-ing the students; we were expected to be able to understand the raw material, and over time and a lot of guidance, we became a lot better at this).  I also thought it was cool that we were able to explore our own area of interest through the pilot and then final research paper. \r\nThe only weaknesses I can identify are that a lot of the material we covered felt rushed, especially by the end. Oftentimes, we would not get through an entire paper in class (because students would end up asking questions that led to a lot of tangents), and also we did not get much classmate feedback on our projects, as our presentations were very limited in time. Perhaps the beginning of the class should be sped up a little bit, students should be restricted to asking questions only at the end of every class and/or have a time limit to the number of questions we can indulge per student per class, and more time should be delegated to the end for project presentations and going over the last set of papers. ",
            "\u00a0I think Maria is an interesting professor, but sometimes she can get distracted and will start heading in a different direction than where she was originally headed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the instructor is very enthusiastic and knowledgable about the subject matter, and that if you find it interesting you will be fascinated after every lecture. The main weakness of the course is that it is hard to see the road ahead, especially since the topic is niche and it is likely that the students have very little, if any, exposure to the topics that are studied.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I feel that having a more clear feedback system earlier on in the semester with regards to the final projects would've been helpful. And although the workload is already not small, continuing the weekly Q&A/reading response type assignments for the readings of the course would also help increase student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a strong narrative sense to it. I really liked that we could trace a line back through the content we had learned, all the way back to the WLG model, and see how each theory we learned built off the previous ones, or departed from them in some major way, making it notable. This made the content more interesting because what we were learning didn't feel irrelevant but part of a larger story. Professor Piango's lectures were generally really interesting and they included the class in a lot of discussions, which was a really good way to teach the class, in my opinion. One weakness is how the class is structured in terms of assignments and exams. There were 3 exams (including the final) in the 5 weeks or so of the class. This felt a little overwhelming, but the exams were manageable, so it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It was also a little overwhelming because the final part of the class involves you conducting a pilot study and then proposing a neurolinguistic study based on the results of the pilot. This involves a lot of work and planning, so it was difficult to juggle everything the class required in addition to my other courses, especially given Prof. Piango's strict adherence to deadlines. It felt like a lot of stuff was shoved into the last few weeks (mostly evaluative). That being said, it was still a great course. "

            "\u00a0I would if you are mostly interested in the linguistic aspect of neurolinguistics, but not if you are looking to learn more specifically about neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0It's interesting subject matter, but is more work than you think it will be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It is organized very well, and it becomes extremely satisfying at the end to say that we have mastered all the material and really gone in depth into this problem across 20+ papers. I will say that the class is very niche, in that the subject matter all falls under a very narrow umbrella: building an accurate model of brain-language relations. At the very least, those interested in taking the class should be interested in the brain half or the linguistics half of this topic; the entirety of this class is not catered to those without much background or interest. Immediately from the first day, we start off diving into the deep end, and though there is room for many questions and catching up, the class moves fast enough that you need to have personal interest in the topic or else you will quickly fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0If you are very interested in linguistics, then yes. This class focuses a lot on the linguistics side of neurolinguistics, rather than the euro side. The blurb for the class is not totally accurate to what the class actually entails. For example, we didn't really talk much about degenerative diseases, mental illness, or music. We did discuss neuroimaging a lot towards the end of the course, but not as much neurophysiology (we only read one paper about this that really discussed neurobiology). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who find the subject matter interesting, but you should know that it is not easy - and that the homeworks and projects take up a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0This is not a class where you can sit back and enjoy the ride  you are in the drivers seat. It is involved. It is nuanced. It is rigorous. Its A LOT, but in the best way possible. If this is the type of class that makes you tick, I think youll have one of the most rewarding experiences of your Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in linguistics or cognitive science. The course does kind of a deep dive into the brain and theories of the brain surrounding language, so if that sounds interesting at all, you should definitely take it. The workload rating on Coursetable said it was a 5 for work but that is not true; it's a more work than most of my other classes, but definitely not a 5. Maybe a 4/3. It's a pretty satisfying class to take and I feel like I've come out of it with an understanding of something I never would be able to understand without taking a class on it, which feels really good. It was frustrating at times and Prof. Piango can be difficult to work with but she only wants the best for her students and it shows in her teaching. "
