            "\u00a0I developed lots of knowledge of phage, viruses in general, bacteria, and lab techniques and etiquette. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH from this class! From general lab protocols, sterile technique, and facts about phage/bacteria to (more importantly) how to set up and perform a full, five-week experiment. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of experiment design, technical lab skills, and a much better understanding of what lab work is really like. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the tools and techniques used to study phage in a lab.  I also learned how to create and perform an effective and informative experimental protocol and keep a lab notebook.  I came into the class with no prior knowledge in this area, and by the end of the semester I created my own experimental protocol to research a topic of my choice.  It was an amazing course! ",
            "\u00a0I learned technical biology research skills, how to design and conduct a compact research project, and how to design and present a poster of my work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned valuable skills to use in laboratories, not only procedural techniques such as pipetting and serial dilution spot plates, but also how to design and execute a successful experiment. ",
            "\u00a0Some DNA/bio basics, a lot of new information about virus/bacteria interactions, a lot of insight into what it's like to do research at the undergrad, grad, and professional levels, and a lot of skills related to developing original research/experiments. ",
            "\u00a0Basic lab skills, poster and presentation skills, research skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to design an independent project, troubleshoot experiments, discuss science with colleagues, and present my findings in a formal professional environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible for learning basic lab skills as well as designing experiments. It offers an opportunity to learn the process of real scientific inquiry and presentation of new scientific knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a full research experiment from beginning to end, as well as the basics of phage microbiology. ",

            "\u00a0Overall, I don't think there are many weaknesses. The strength is learning how to design and complete a final project with support from the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the amount of independence it gives students. I honestly think its only limitations are practical in nature, like we can't do PCR/flow/any sort of advanced molecular biology techniques in our experiments because these things are super expensive. The course is set up as well as it possibly can be given the number of students and time we have. ",
            "\u00a0This class is perfect!  The only thing that could make it better if there was a similar next level class to take after this one so that I could take it again! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. Best biology lab Yale has to offer. Truly no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It's a small lab course, which is super cool; the mentorship from the professor and TAs is individualized and very helpful; getting to create and carry out your own experiment is awesome, and the class is really well-resourced. I was attracted to the class because I was an underclassmen who hadn't done any college-level research (to some degree who the class is geared for), and at times I was frustrated because I felt really unprepared/not anywhere as knowledgeable as upperclassmen STEM majors who were in the class. They probably added to the class because they knew a lot and were willing to share their knowledge, but it was at times really frustrating to feel like they could get better grades/design more in-depth projects/have more to talk about with teachers because they'd already done research and were starting off with a lot more information. If there were enough underclassmen to fill the class, I think that would've been cool and maybe would've created a more balanced environment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the TF, Ryan, and the ability to learn about research and lab work in a more monitored classroom setting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that there is definitely pressure to stay late even if it is said that its not required; Dr. Burmeister once said to a student that she notes who stays late, which to me creates pressure. Also, while Dr. Burmeister is super smart and clearly VERY passionate about the class and the subject, she does not come across as a warm person and I often felt uncomfortable when approaching her in class. ",
            "\u00a0It was an amazing class and nothing I'd change! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is quite fine tailored to everybody's needs since it's small and you can really go at your own pace in some instances. There are a mix of activities and you won't just be doing experiments every week. You will read papers, talk about project design with instructors and classmates, and practice important skills like giving chalk talks about certain topics. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great introduction to biological science. However, many of the students in the course did have research experience, which can sometimes be intimidating for students who do not. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There were many opportunities to seek extra help during office hours and during class, and it was a challenging course that encouraged me to work hard and dig deeper in the research to figure out a gap in the research that I could investigate in my project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because the different parts of the project took varying amounts of time, we would often stay after class to finish up our experiments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because it was designed to help students learn about a research setting. The instructors were inviting and willing to help. It made research approachable. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a great way to test out if research and science is for you! It's lots of fun and your progress and learning is concrete. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely, 100% recommend this course to any student who thinks they might be interested in research. It's a great lab experience, you literally don't need to know anything coming in to the class, and you learn so much about what it's like to design and perform your own experiments in a very comfortable, low-pressure environment. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Dr. Burmeister is fabulous, the content is interesting, and you will learn how to be a virology scientist. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class at Yale.  I would love to take it again if I could, so I would definitely recommend it to someone else.  I felt like I learned so much, and I had a ton of fun going to lab every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a very interesting biology lab that is designed for people who have no experience with lab bench research. It is a steep learning curve, but if you put the work in you will get a lot out of it. Like most labs at Yale, it is more work than a half credit. However, the work was more interesting than most other labs. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Truly one of, if not, my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - great support from teachers, super cool topic, very hands-on, all-around great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good lab if you need a bio lab and its an interesting subject area. Dr. Burmeister is clearly passionate, but I wish she had been a little more warm and welcoming in a classroom setting, although one on one was better. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if you want to gain wet lab skills and scientific research skills! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another students, especially first-years and sophomores who would like to gain hands-on research experience before joining an actual lab. This class will really help acclimate you to real research and all that it entails. It is not a typical lab class where you go learn a method and then do an experiment and no one cares about your results. You will actually develop a new independent project and generate novel data that could be used further in actual scientists' projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a fantastic introduction to research. However, the workload greatly increases the second half of the semester when independent projects begin, so students should not take it with a very high courseload. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a challenging microbiology research course. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. Dr. Burmeister is amazing. The class is really designed for students who don't have much research experience, and does a wonderful job introducing you to and immersing you in a research setting. "
