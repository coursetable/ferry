            "\u00a0This is the most detailed math class I've ever taken because the way it was taught threw a lot of concepts at us on a daily basis. Due to this, however, there was not a lot of practice in class. The only practice was on psets and WebAssign which were for grades. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the broad range of calculus topics it covers. I think it gives a very good introduction to the subject of calculus. However, I don't think every student is on the same level. For example, many students have already taken AP Calc but as someone who has never taken it, a lot of the concepts presented were new for me and I don't think it was taught in a manner that benefitted students who were learning things for the first time. Also, the p-sets were considerably challenging and I had to go to office hours often to figure out how to solve the problems. This was really time-consuming, and it was difficult to manage spending so much time on math given my other classes. I think the p-sets should model more of the kind of questions we will see on exams. Also, I think more time in class should be spent on how to approach problems and using calculus in a practical manner. There were so many tips and tricks I learned from other people that helped me solve and understand problems and I wish they would have been taught in class. Overall, I was disappointed with the way Math 112 was structured for students who have never completed a formal introductory calculus course. ",
