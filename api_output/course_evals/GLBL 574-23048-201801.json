            "\u00a0I was a great opportunity to become familiar with the basic rules and literature of the International Human Rights and the implication of them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about human rights law and the problems in the field as well as the hopes for the future of human rights. The course was very thought provoking and it helped me think about the law, which prior to this course I knew nothing about. "

            "\u00a0I adored everything about this class except for the time it was held. 8am is for coffee, not class. My brain is not awake. I am unable to function as a human being at that ungodly hour. Im sure you didnt pick it, but I just thought I would register my displeasure. Please tell the registrar that 8am classes are unacceptable.\r\n\r\nOther than the time I loved the class. It was great. I did think that a lot of the same people talked over and overthey had good points, but I would have liked to have heard from others too. I think this problem would be solved by a class later in the day. Also more cold calling, but thats not as fun as an afternoon class.\r\n\r\nAlso, I really, really, really appreciated the way you organized the readings on Canvas. You made it super easy to find all the readings and to know what I was supposed to do on what day. Most other professors are not so considerate.\r\n\r\nAlso I would have appreciated more grades. Maybe this is a law school thing, but I like to measure my learning before its too late to do anything about major gaps. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. It was a fantastic course-- very intellectually engaging, and quite enjoyable at the same time. I would recommend it without reservations. "
