            "\u00a0100% recommend this course. I wanted to take this course to increase and improve my Korean ability and reconnect with my heritage. By the end of this course, I can safely say that I'm able to write very strong and complete sentences, understand and speak Korean well. Professor Choi is a loving teacher who really cares about you even more as a student - she was like a second mom to me, always being very thoughtful and caring for me. ",

            "\u00a0I improved my Korean speaking, reading, and listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to refine my understanding of the grammatical structures and writing styles that comprised the Korean language. I had been familiar with a lot of words and phrases in Korean as a heritage speaker, but had lacked the foundational education that I needed to detect the nuances of the language. This course was immensely helpful to learning the differences between certain word and style choices. ",

            "\u00a0This class is really unorganized. Compared to what I've heard about other languages L3 classes, there doesn't seem to be a lot of structure. Oftentimes it was very confusing. That and this is a heritage class but they suggest that anyone who's complete a summer abroad also goes into this class. I don't think that really works, unfortunately. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you really have a lot of interactivity in this class and you must participate. You really get what you put in, and if you want to learn Korean, you definitely will. The course did seem unorganized at times, but Prof. Choi does a really good job of teaching the material and making sure that you really understand concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - Horribly disorganized, especially compared to regular L1 and L2 (which was taught by the same professor). I'm incredibly disappointed at how poor the instruction was compared to the previous Korean classes I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Choi was very encouraging and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0A good class to beef up on certain vocab for non-heritage speakers. Grammar was for the most part simple and taught for hertage learners to understand. Speaking practice is limited. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very disorganized, and it was often unclear what we were supposed to do for many assignments. In terms of class content, I wish that we had more speaking practice. This class could be most improved if people at different levels were more accurately separated into appropriate levels! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fun and interesting way to learn Korean. Weakness: course was a little bit disorganized so sometimes the assignments were confusing. ",
            "\u00a0This class needs to be separated into heritage speakers and light fellows to facilitate proper learning and teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that we are able to learn Korean and not be afraid of making mistakes during the process. I wish the course was a little more structered at times, however. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall a great learning experience because it was able to engage students without overwhelming them. It progressed at a pace that was conducive to fully grasping different aspects to the Korean language. This course was also well-organized in that it introduced material in order of increasing difficulty. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it has helped me become much more comfortable with Korean. ",
