            "\u00a0I gained a more worldly perspective from all the traveling. I also learned a lot more about film than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Czech and Czech films. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of conversational Czech, Czech history and how it persisted in Czech film and fiction, as well as most aspects of making a short film (screenwriting, producing (planning shots, acquiring props, scouting out locations, etc.), directing, camerawork, and editing). The also learned a surprising amount of European history during the last week of travelling through four countries (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Italy) by visiting their museums and monuments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to immerse myself in a different country's culture, while learning that country's language and studying that coutnry's film and literature. "

            "\u00a0The professor did not give clear feedback, and, when she did, it was neither constructive nor helpful. She did not give us due dates for assignments, and then was frustrated when we failed to comply with the due dates she had in her head. She was poor at leading literature seminars, as she spent most of the time talking and wasn't open to hearing new opinions. When a student did present a new and interesting opinion, she tried to homogenize it into her static perspective of the book. She also was pretty poor at teaching us Czech, as she tried to give us all the cases at once, instead of, as any reasonable professor would do, teaching us cases slowly so we can learn their specifics.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did still enjoy my time in the course because the literature was actually incredible and I think everyone should read the books we read in this course. I loved discussing the books with my classmates outside of class. I also did grow a lot from the film program. However, the film program was broken up a bit unevenly because some students had much more responsibilities while some students had almost none. It would have been nice if everybody had an even amount of work so everyone could grow equally.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a very well-run course if run by a different professor. The subject matter was super interesting, and my only regret is that I couldn't have gotten a deeper insight on the literature and films. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nReadings/Films - I really enjoyed the selection of works\r\n\r\nFilmmaking - it was so fun and made me really appreciate the work put into films. It made me consider film as a major and I regret not taking more film classes. \r\n\r\nTravelling -Best part of the program! We went to amazing places!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nCzech - I felt very little motivation to learn Czech because most people knew English, we had to start speaking English at the beginning and it was a difficult precedent to break, and Czech isn't spoken very prevalently outside of the Czech Republic. Once we learned enough Czech, we were already leaving for other countries, so it felt rather useless. It was nice to have a foundation for other Slavic languages though. \r\n\r\nFilm schedule: it was weird because we were told to have a script done by a Monday but we were doing story writing exercises that day. I would suggest having story writing exercises, then having more time to brainstorm scripts. It would have also been nice to have more time to plan the films, but it was a valuable experience to have such a tight deadline. ",
            "\u00a0A definite strength of this course is the fact that we are fully immersed in Czech culture by being in Prague. However, the professor is the weakness. I greatly enjoyed this study abroad experience, but I feel I could have learned a lot more if the course had been organized better, if the professor had been able to answer questions (or even provide any kind of useful feedback on writing assignments or Czech dialogues), or if the course had a clear aim with more clearly led discussions.

            "\u00a0I would not necessarily recommend this course. If there had been a different professor, I surely would recommend it. The subject matter and literature of the course were super interesting. However, in its current state, I would say that people should probably not take it unless they come in aware that most learning will happen outside of class. You do get to travel to a lot of cool countries and do get immersed in Czech culture, in addition to learning about film, so if you're willing to put up with the professor then by all means take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! The readings and films were incredibly engaging, and although filming requires long hours, it was fun and rewarding. The last week is like a free vacation through amazing places in Europe and learn about their histories and lifestyles. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this excursion to anyone interested in studying abroad and not doing much work. I had an amazing time, but I did not learn near as much as I wanted to. This course was more like a Yale-funded vacation than a class. "
