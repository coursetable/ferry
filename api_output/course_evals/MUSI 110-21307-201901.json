            "\u00a0You learn the basics of music, from sheet music reading to harmony/melody to basic music analysis. Really gives you a better understanding/appreciation for music to listen to/play in day-to-day life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of music theory and composition. ",
            "\u00a0I developed basic music theory knowledge and became somewhat proficient with music making software. ",

            "\u00a0Major minor keys, chords, chord progression and song structure. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses are that each section has a different instructor that does things differently- my class only got to do one composition during the entire semester. However, it is also nice that each instructor can tailor the class to their particular interests. ",
            "\u00a0Begins very basic, so I felt like I had a foundation to build upon. It was a little quick towards the middle of the semester, but slowed down sufficiently so that we could go over everything we didn't know. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is a small class and so you are able to engage better with the material and the professor really is understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Good selection of material. Could have spent more time on developing melody lines. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't pass the placement test to get placed in higher level courses, but the first half of the course was too easy. I wish there would be more ear training and less going over the principles mechanically because a lot of them were just simple calculations of the same stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The course is intro level but there are people who take it that know more and make the pace a bit fast. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great class to take even for people with no musical background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes i would, music surrounds us and plays a big role in our lives as human beings and it is important and interesting to understanding how this almost mysterious concept works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Nice intro to music theory that will prepare you well for higher level classes. ",
