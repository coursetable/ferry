The weaknesses of this course are the fact that the problem sets can be very difficult.

The class isn't that difficult conceptually, but its like trying to eat 3 loaves of stale bread--easy and doable if you need to but absolutely disgusting. \r\n\r\nThe content is somewhat of a mixed bag of different concepts in economics and tying them together is very difficult until you reach close to the end of the semester (which I feel that the big thematic idea is trying to find optimal choice and using calculus to find that). The concepts and examples are too abstract and arbitrary. Although the professor told us to review the data prior to making any judgments on the theory, these utility and production functions seemed too artificial and not applicable at all. There is little explanation why we should take these theories as models for the world, and less explanation why they prove useful in higher economics. The professor defers these questions to later economics courses, but this class makes me question whether or not I should even take those future courses. To make these worse, the material is not very inspiring, and can get really dry. A common sight (which I feel bad for the professor) are students falling asleep in class. Professor Borgers is a very smart and very kind man, and this kind of disrespect is unacceptable. However, even he could not redeem the material as it drags economics to a pseudo-science/pseudo-academic subject. The material is just not that relevant and contradictory. ",
