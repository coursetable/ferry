            "\u00a0I expected more of a \"deep-dive\" into the different qualitative methods. I felt that the focus could have been more evenly distributed between learning about the ethics of research and the methodologies of qualitative research. The course felt overly weighted toward ethics. I think this was visible at the end of the class. Student presentations were weakest in the methodologies sections of their proposals. Everyone used the same set of methodologies: interviews, participant observation, questionnaires...Overall, I would have liked to gain a better understanding of why a researcher might use one methodology over another or why they might take a phenomenological approach versus an ethnographic approach versus a case study approach, etc. etc. ",

            "\u00a0The strongest part of this course is ample time for workshopping and feedback of research proposal components with peers and the instructor. The weakness was that sometimes classes were too packed with activities that we would be rushed through our reading discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course surveys different qualitative research methods, the lectures are very informative and Amity allows for a lot of in-class discussions. However, this course is heavily ethnography -focused (most of the reading materials). ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was overall great, but sometimes the group discussions on peoples'  papers were only mildly helpful, or we didn't get to everyone on time. Maybe more meetings one on one with the professor? ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course provided more opportunities to learn about mixed methods. I also wish there was less emphasis on indigenous studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would make several changes to this course: \r\n1) I would prefer to have more frequent and firm deadlines for submitting pieces of the research proposal. These could begin relatively early in the semester. This would ensure that students get feedback throughout developing their proposals. Also, ongoing deadlines prevent students from leaving everything to the last minute.\r\n2) It would be better to have the guest lecture about research funding much earlier in the semester (like, in September) so that students can process this information and apply it to their proposals. \r\n\r\nBest thing about this course: Amity does an excellent job of facilitating engaging and lively group discussions. ",
            "\u00a0It provided practical skills in social science. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the students who take the course. The people in this class are some of the brightest people at FES. \r\n\r\nThe in-class workshopping of the projects always felt a bit forced and unproductive. I'm not sure how it can be made more productive. Perhaps have students share their work with each other outside of class might be more productive. It could be a bi-weekly assignment or something...All I know is that it wasn't a good use of class time. \r\n\r\nI felt that the assignments and readings weren't always that helpful in creating the final proposal. I would have liked if some of the assignments had been to actually read proposals and analyze them. The comparative analysis paper came closest to this, but I think it would have been more helpful to analyze proposals rather than fully published papers. \r\n\r\nI thought the class suffered from not have stricter deadlines. \r\n\r\nAlso, forming the research question remained the hardest part (and still does!). I would have appreciated more guidance on how to form a research question. I think a lot of people struggled with that. ",
            "\u00a0Good class participation.  Energetic lectures, \r\n\r\nmore peer to peer interaction is always good.  Those were some of the best times. My final project was not as ready as i would have liked, and I cannot figure out what i did wrong, or didnt do.  Perhaps more specific instruction to students/ more tight deadlines would help us in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't a big fan of the readings and didn't feel like I came out of the course with a set of new skills....\r\nOne book that I found helpful in interviewing was: Fujii, Lee Ann.  Interviewing in Social Science Research: A Relational Approach. Routledge 2017 ",
            "\u00a0Strength - engaging in deep analysis of real cases.\r\n\r\nWeakness - not much research seems current, favorite students were catered to. Mixed-methods were grazed over. Many assignments felt like undergraduate theory or busy work, not professional skills for applied field work. ",

The reason one might take this course is to take what would otherwise be a somewhat lonely and isolating endeavor and to do it with 15-20 peers. It makes the process more fun. You get out of this class what you put in. It's pretty loosely organized. ",
