            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to discuss across different texts' take on histories and what to focus on when thinking about themes of movements across time. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course to expand my notion of feminism and the feminist movement beyond the prevailing whitewashed, middle/upper-class norms; to learn how people at the grassroots level take political action and effect institutional change in small yet meaningful ways; and to practice studying social policy through a historical lens. The course helped me make progress toward all of these goals and more, including how to conduct primary source historical research, which I found valuable even as a non-history major. More specifically, I learned how women, both in the mainstream and at the margins of society, have persistently and collectively struggled for economic and racial justice and substantive equality ever since they gained legal suffrage in 1920. I learned about the gendered and racialized barriers that stood in their way, the clever strategies and impressive determination they used to overcome them, and the challenges that obstinately remain. I learned how a historical lens helps us understand how seemingly gender-neutral policies can be either radically sexist or feminist in conception and/or impact. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to research archives and cite in Chicago. I think it is important for people who aren't history majors to learn the skill of researching, and Jennifer is good at helping individuals learn how to research. "

            "\u00a01. Although many of our readings were, on a week-to-week basis, very strong, the connections between weeks' readings were not always as explicit as they might have been. Sometimes it felt as if we could have had a certain week's discussion the week prior, or vice versa  the logic of the order was not always obvious. Greater guidance by the instruction during discussion, bringing students back to themes from previous weeks, might help remedy this.\r\n2. Although we did engage in very limited instances with historical episodes involving lesbian women, we never read about trans-women, and our overall consideration of the analytical frameworks of gender and sexuality were, in general, lacking. I appreciated the week of readings about masculinity, which seemed to represent a tacit acknowledgement of the fact that gender is, on some level, relational, but... more could be done there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the precise choice of the readings. However, I wished we had connected the readings to the present moment a little bit more often. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are interesting and the use of archival material for essays is engaging. The final paper on a topic of your choice allows you to delve into a topic that is important to you. There is a lot of reading, and it is important to do most of it to participate in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Klein has curated a fascinating reading list and does a good job of opening class discussion with key questions and themes from the readings and filling in gaps in students' historical knowledge. She is sharp as a tack and offers extremely comprehensive summaries and explanations and incisive critiques of the historiography of any given topic. You can learn a lot by listening to her, however random and tangential her comments might be sometimes. She also makes herself available outside of her class for extra academic support and further discussion about the course material, which I highly recommend taking advantage of, since she can come across a bit intimidating in class but is super friendly, sensitive, and approachable in one-on-one meetings. She also gives really thorough feedback on your papers, which is useful when writing subsequent ones and learning how to write and think like a historian. The assignments, although awfully time-consuming, are interesting and valuable learning experiences if you give yourself enough time to complete them with care. The progression of them is nice, too, because they help prepare you with the research skills and mental fortitude to complete the final primary source research paper, which can be a hefty undertaking for students who haven't conducted original historical research before.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't get much out of class discussion. In my opinion, our class tended to over-intellectualize people's individual histories and historians' narratives and arguments, whereas I would have preferred to talk about concrete connections between past women's social movements and present ones, which I had hoped the course would emphasize (it didn't as much as I expected it would). We also went on a bunch of tangents that didn't seem important to me or to understanding the week's themes. All that said, the quality of conversation probably depends a lot on the group of students who take the class, both in terms of interests (i.e., which parts of the readings pique their interest) and personality (i.e., who dominates the seminar and who stays quiet). So my experience does not necessarily say anything about what future students' experiences will be like. Another weakness might also be that the volume of reading each week is incredibly high, and the reading itself can be very dense. Start the reading earlier in the week rather than later, and read for big ideas, not small details. ",
            "\u00a0Jennifer Klein is good at teaching her students how to research and is good at breaking up the syllabus so that you can manage the amount of work she asks of you. However, the course can be boring and the feedback takes extremely long to get back, which is frustrating for students. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a ton of work, which caused a tremendous amount of stress but didn't actually lead to greater engagement with the course. I found that there was too much reading week to week, which led students to come to class underprepared (having obviously not read all of the material), to the detriment of class discussions. There were also too many assignments over the course of the semester -- weekly reading questions, an analysis paper, an archive-based research paper, a podcast, several iterations of final paper outlines, and the final paper. The preparatory assignments for the final paper were helpful in kicking us into gear and getting us organized, but the three other assignments, in combination, led to near constant stress over the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nClass discussions were also variable in quality. Some days were very engaging and exciting, but other days we jumped haphazardly from topic to topic, unable to flesh out each strand of conversation fully, and often failing to discuss overarching points or themes.\r\n\r\nThat said, the syllabus for this course is excellent, and the class's focus on gender and organizing is very exciting. Yale could use more courses that consider gender and women in the context of history and politics. Prof. Klein is very knowledgable, and assigned texts that covered women's organizing across a wide variety of contexts. There could have been another couple texts on Asian American feminisms, but other than that, I was very pleased with the diversity of the syllabus. "

            "\u00a0A solid history seminar, but not the best one out there. I learned a lot about particular moments in U.S. women's history, but discerning overall themes or through-lines was not always facilitated well by Klein. Prof. Klein is very helpful in guiding students with their final projects, though, so you might find this course attractive as a vehicle toward completing a research project you're interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I think it's an incredible look into this period and focuses on many groups that are most often underrepresented. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have the time to dedicate to it. It requires a lot of time (out of class movies, readings, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you have the right intentions and ample time and energy to invest in the course. This class is tough in terms of workload and intellectual challenge; Professor Klein expects consistently high-quality work and participation from her students. I wouldn't recommend the course to students who just like to dabble in history for recreation. History seminars are much different from history lectures. I entered this course having taken two history lectures (for additional context, I'm not a history major), and then got thrown off-kilter by the demands of a departmental seminar. The pace is much faster and the analysis much deeper. While the rigor was rewarding overall, at times the course asked more of me than I was willing to give it. So I would take this course only if 1) you'll allot the necessary time to do this subject justice, and 2) you want to learn how to do your own historical research and writing and delve into historical thought deeply and longingly, rather than consider it lightly with only fleeting attention. If you meet these conditions, then I am confident that you'll have an immensely positive experience learning with and from Professor Klein. She has a wealth of insight about women's history, will compel you to clarify your convictions about social justice and equality, and then inspire you to act upon them. She might not be the most approachable or smooth in seminar, but get to know her one-on-one and you'll find that she is kind and sensitive and thoughtful in addition to being brilliant. She wants the best for her students and works hard to help them find their way in college and in life. Be patient, take initiative, and ask questions to get the most out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend it, but potentially as a cred-d class for a student to learn how to do archival research. It is, however, a lot of work if one person simply wants to cred-d it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely great course to take Cr/D. The information is extremely interesting and everyone should learn about grassroots and women's movements in the 20th century. What I learned in this class fundamentally changed how I understand US society. Unfortunately, there is too much reading and work to keep up with. If you are going to take this class for a grade, it should be your one hard course for your semester. ",
            "\u00a0Check out the syllabus, and see if the readings are sufficiently interesting to you to make the assignments worth it.\r\n\r\nAlso, Prof. Klein has an annoying policy during shopping period: \"if you read the book and show up next week, you're in the class.\" I was put off that she wouldn't send out a class roster or waitlist, and didn't want to read the book for Week 2 only to find there wasn't room for me in the class, but there ended up being something like 12 students the second week (after a very full classroom on the first day), and everyone got in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about the history of women's grassroots organizing in post-war US history, and are comfortable with a heavy reading load each week. "
