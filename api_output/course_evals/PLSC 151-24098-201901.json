            "\u00a0I wouldn't say I developed new skills in this class, but there were definitely the beginnings of topics that I'm interested to explore more. ",
            "\u00a0We spent a lot of time talking about current events (Brexit) and interesting speculative questions about the future of Global Economic Governance. I developed a better knowledge of the major international economic organizations and the major debates in political science today. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new knowledge of current global economic issues as well as the infrastructure of international economic institutions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better grasp of global economic governance and how to analyze current global trends and events in this field. ",

            "\u00a0It's a very interesting, complex topic and the professor seemed to be rather engaged. The structure was a big issue, mainly that there wasn't much. We spent entirely too much time on current topics, which would have been reasonable if they were better tied into the theme of the weekly class. Unfortunately, they were not. The readings varied in approachability, quality, and relevance. Few students had any background information on the various institutions we discussed and it would have been more productive and engaging if the readings had been better tailored to address this. One article or synopsis with an overview and two or three readable articles that are more closely aligned with one another would help students prepare for a more robust discussion. Many of the assigned readings were extremely opaque, which is a feat when most in the room had perfect reading comprehension scores and are accustomed to heavy reading loads. The result was painfully low levels of participation in what should have been energetic discussions. Most students were on their laptops throughout class. There was no clear tie-in to previous classes or a linear progression of understanding. A wrap-up would have been helpful each week, as I often walked out not able to articulate what we covered (again, better, more connected readings would help). Also, it's very frustrating to spend so much time on 4 or 5 readings and only one is discussed. Why bother? (again, I have a feeling most students didn't do the readings because of this). The professor clearly wanted to spark bigger discussions in class, but the material didn't prepare students well and the questions asked were not always clear or broad enough to allow that to happen. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like Keohanes Hegemony was a little dense, and felt like the ideas could have been explained on the board during class (before the reading). The discussion and debates during the class were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Many of the class discussions did not require much knowledge of the readings, since we would talk about current events as much as the literature. We would often have class debates like \"What is the future of cryptocurrency and how will it affect international governance?\" which everyone could easily engage with regardless of how much they read. This was enjoyable, but I fear that I did not improve my ability to synthesize academic writing. \r\n\r\nCourse readings were split between academic articles and magazine articles for popular audiences. It didn't take much time to prepare for class. I wish more of the articles were geared towards academic audiences.\r\n\r\nI felt the paper assignments were unimaginative. I would have preferred if Prof. Pratt had just asked us to come up with a question to answer or provided more prompts. Instead, both essays asked us to evaluate the performance of an international organization and make policy recommendations about it.\r\n\r\nWe had in-class debates every week between 2 people which would have been fun except that the topics were simplistic to the point of banality. (Think \"Should the E.U. exist?\") I would recommend that Prof. Pratt require more creative debate topics in the future which are more directly derived from course readings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pratt was very flexible in regards to weekly readings and making sure they were keeping up with the current changes in international economic conditions. ",
            "\u00a0The course attracted people from very different backgrounds and levels of understanding of global economic governance. I think an important improvement would be ensuring that the basics are covered even if there are students with a more advanced understanding. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but it would depend on the class makeup. We didn't have the right balance of students and some weeks were painful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! A must take for anyone interested in learning more about international institutions and economics! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a relaxing and enjoyable course to talk about current events. Professor Pratt seems like a very good conversationalist in the sense that he asks questions you might talk about with your friends. Discussions were often lively  although rarely very academic. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if you want to keep up with current international economic headlines. The readings are engaging and I came to each seminar excited to learn more about the ever-changing conditions of political and economic policy and cooperation. ",
            "\u00a0When taking this course, make sure you are comfortable approaching most themes/topics from the perspective of institutionsit may or may not be your cup of tea, but it is certainly the angle that grounds all of the material covered in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a really solid course with a really good professor, and I'd recommend it to folks interested in learning more about economic institutions! "
