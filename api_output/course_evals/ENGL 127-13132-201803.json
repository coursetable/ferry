            "\u00a0I learned a lot about American authors and works of literature from all different time periods. ",
            "\u00a0When I took this class, I confess that I felt a little discomfited. At first I felt like the political over-saturated our discussion of the literary - we spent a lot of time talking about race, class, gender, and sexuality from a liberal perspective - and I feared minority tokenism on the syllabus. \"I signed up for an English seminar, not an ER&M class or a WGSS class! I wanted to talk about not just identity politics, but meaning outside of them!\" said my reactionary self. However, this class has challenged my assumptions about what constitutes \"American\" literature. The formation of a canon inherently has to do with political and social forces, and I cannot fault this class for including these forces in our discussions of poetry, novels, and plays. (I also didn't read the syllabus carefully enough at the start of the class; it mentions that the course will consider questions of identity, not just questions of literary merit.) In terms of skill improvements, I improved at textual analysis and writing in general. I also feel like I have a better, broader sense of what constitutes \"American\" literature because the texts on our syllabus represented a good mix of canonized works and newer or less famous texts. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to read, connect ideas, listen to others, argue for my thesis ",
            "\u00a0This course challenged me to look critically at American literature in a sociopolitical context. We considered various essential questions about what it means to be American and why each piece was significant in the American literary canon. I also learned a lot about engaging with secondary sources of literary criticism in order to enhance my own arguments about literature. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to communicate my ideas improved immensely, and I absolutely loved class discussions about the texts we read. I liked some of the texts more than others, but each one was valuable in its own way and had so much to offer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only about literature but also about American culture's development through the centuries. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely got better at close reading, and I learned how to handle larger amounts of text than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0This is a superb class. You learn how to flesh out your ideas and push yourself in your writing. There were only three papers of about 4-6 pages each but they are graded quite strictly and you get a ton of feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a foundational cultural literacy of several movements, 'great texts,' and influential authors in American literature. I improved my written literary analysis, my ability to contribute to and help build/advance a seminar discussion, and my efficiency at high-quality annotation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about American literature with particular regard to social, racial, and colonialist contexts, and was exposed to a variety of voices that, historically, have not been included in the definition of what \"classic\" American Literature means. I learned to think more critically about what it means to be an American, to be part of the American literary tradition, and to be part of American history. ",
            "\u00a0The most important thing I learned is that American literature is not and should not be defined by traditional standards. I learned to redefine and challenge what is considered American lit and that was very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Hickey challenged me to think differently about American Literature, making me question what it even means to be an \"American\" author. Through fiction, I got a better understanding of Native history and Native American Literature. Hickey's research focuses a lot on Native American Literature so you should definitely take this class if you want to learn more (or even if you don't know anything about Native literature but would like to). The discussions were pleasant, often centering around race and sexuality, both in a modern and historical context. Hands down one of my favorite literature classes I've taken at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings are really interesting and provide a surprisingly diverse survey of the American canon\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions usually revolve around similar topics; it would be refreshing to bring in new ideas ",
            "\u00a0I think the syllabus design was very effective in getting us to think about how these works related to each other and what made a work of literature \"American.\" I also liked the more open-ended essay prompts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great flexibility for students to express thoughts, amazing professor who gives clear feedback on each students comment in class, good selection of texts ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was a great overview of American literature, and it forced me to think a lot about the social context surrounding each piece. Everyone was always super engaged in discussion, and we were often able to dig very deep. If I had to point out a weakness, I would say that we often got carried away in discussion, and I didn't always feel like we hit all the points we needed to in regards to a certain piece, but I feel like this was just a product of everyone's enthusiasm. ",
            "\u00a0As a seminar, the discussion-based class sessions were such a pleasure to attend. You get to know your professor and your classmates well, which makes talking about the books we read really exciting. The only weakness is that there isn't enough time in the semester to fully unpack everything on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have appreciated more work on writing in class. The class handled the reading part very well, but the writing felt like a very small part of the class, despite being most of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was great all around. Reading Moby Dick is a pain, but it also seemed necessary and I think the course would suffer without it. I'm not sure, though. Maybe more texts by female authors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths : Prof. Hickey is a fantastic seminar leader. I never got the impression (which many other professors cause) that there was one right analysis of a text towards which she was pushing us, and the class rose to this with intellectual enthusiasm and vigor. She also really cared about making this course somehow productively representative of American literature. This was especially evident in our non-central texts -- as an example, we read Apess's Eulogy of King Philip next to the Whitman, and we ended the course with essays and poetry by authors like Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Zitkala-Sa, Gloria Anzaldua, Ocean Vuong, and more, and then There, There by Tommy Orange. Her research interests in indigenous literature and history definitely enriched the course. I also enjoyed the general course's shared texts -- the Whitman collection, Moby Dick, Autobiography of An Ex-Colored Man, Father Comes Home From the Wars.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is probably the impossibility of its promise : to endow students with a foundation in all of American literature. This class, though I loved it as it is, could productively be broken into two. ",
            "\u00a0This course did very well with including diverse voices in the second half of the semester, which spurred engaging and necessary conversations that I have not found in courses more \"classically\" based (read: white men of the past only). Essay prompts and guidelines were also open enough to allow for students to have an enormous amount of agency and choice in that which they chose to research and write about, which I loved and learned from immensely. \r\n\r\nI didn't feel that reading Moby Dick added as much to my understanding of American Literature in a wholistic and relevant context in the way that the other texts  it took up a great deal of space that I feel would be far better used by other, more engaging texts. ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading selection is very diverse and u like that we have discussion posts every week. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes - it serves as a good foundation for future English studies ",
            "\u00a0Yes - the literature is good and the discussions were fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, especially with Professor Hickey. Shes great in every way possible caring, knowledgeable, enthusiastic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it is important as an American to consider the literary pieces throughout the nation's history, and I think the course does a great job at highlighting pieces that are not necessarily considered classics, specifically by women and people of color. So, I think this course gives an important look at America, not only through a literary context, but also through a social one. The papers and discussion board posts are in no way overwhelming, and they helped me think critically about the pieces, and the discussions are always very engaging; I rarely felt any boredom. Overall, 10/10 in terms of subject matter and workload ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Even though you have a lot of readings, they're so much fun that you'll actually look forward to doing them, and you still gain so much out of the few tedious ones. Whether or not you plan on going into writing or becoming an English major, every voice has a place in class discussions and everyone can benefit from them. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. I loved the reading list, all of the class discussions were great, and Professor Hickey was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you're willing to really work quite hard on your papers and the readings. It's definitely not an easy course, but it is really enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. And take it with Prof. Hickey!! It's an opportunity to build your cultural literacy (a real cultural literacy, that depends not only on dead white men but also on the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and thinkers that have always contributed to American culture) as an American citizen, sharpen your scholarly skills, and have a wonderful seminar experience. It's a foundational English major course, but many nonmajors (including me, a STEM student) took (and loved) it. However, shop it before you take it -- the group of students will influence your classroom culture will influence your experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely  it's a survey course that covers lots of ground in a short space of time, but leaves enough room for discussion, and provides context that I believe is essential to understand when studying literature and writing in this country. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to read good books take this class. "
