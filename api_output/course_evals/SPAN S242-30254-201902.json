            "\u00a0Developed speaking ability, how to critically read texts ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about Spanish history, specifically the civil war. More importantly, I just learned Spanish, both through the class and readings and conversations with peers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about various readings and aspects of Spanish culture. Improved grammar via homework review. ",
            "\u00a0I drastically improved my Spanish skills in many areas, and also learned a lot about Valencia and Spain in general. I was able to improve my language skills in a pressure-free environment which helped me. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish oral/aural skills, Spanish history/culture/politics, Spanish literary analysis ",
            "\u00a0I gained deeper knowledge on the culture and history of Spain as well as improved my Spanish immensely. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved, and I learned quite a bit about Valencia and Spanish history - my other responses are quite lengthy and should give you all the other information you need. ",
            "\u00a0I gained invaluable experience speaking Spanish as well as learning much about the history, politics, and culture of Spain. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very much information about the Spanish culture, history, and society during this course, as well as better developed my spoken and written Spanish. By living in a native-speaking country for Spanish and abiding by the language pledge, I learned how to navigate daily life in a different language. I also gained research skills in Spanish thanks to the final research paper that my class had to complete.  Lastly, I gained confidence in myself and my speaking abilities by stepping out of my comfort zone and inquiring about the culture and lifestyle of Spain through impromptu conversations with locals. ",
            "\u00a0I am improved as a Spanish speaker through practicing with students, teachers, my host family and locals while learning about the history and culture of Spain and Valencia in a classroom environment. We had online grammar exercises every weekday which covered a wide variety of basic grammar topics covered anywhere from L3 to L5 courses. We gained further practice reading and comprehending in Spanish through class readings and discussions. We spoke to people in numerous settings either on tours, excursions, etc. where we practiced listening and our conversational skills. In the end, we prepared for a debate which allowed us to do research on immigration in Spain and practice speaking and arguing in Spanish against students from the local university. ",
            "\u00a0What I learned was incredible. First, Pilar was a great teacher. However, I think some of the content of the program wasn't always engaging (we had a couple short stories that seemed to tire and repeated on similar themes, during time that we could've been learning other things). I'm so grateful to have learned about Valencian culture through both experiencing the city and through guest lecturers, learning about el ro, el Mercado Central, and la Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias. I also improved my Spanish tremendously, which I'm so excited about, and I think the combination of Pilar teaching us so enthusiastically and setting up the class in a way that enabled good discussion and learning from our peers (and always learning new vocab) coupled with the absolutely incredible experience I had with my host family, really lent itself to a phenomenal learning experience.

            "\u00a0Debate activity could be improved/ more relevant to coursework ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more quizzes so that the questions and vocabulary that accompanied readings were more rewarded. I often crammed for the tests which isnt the best for long term memory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the Professor, the excursions, the readings \r\nWeakness: a lot of work during the last week ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor and the utilization of Valencia and its surroundings. The variety of assessments. \r\nWeaknesses: The fact that all of the work is piled onto the last week makes the last week very stressful. For example, a recording, essay, debate, exam. ",
            "\u00a0Host family was an absolute strength, as well as the excursion. More in-class emphasis on grammar and vocab could have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of homework, however it is not graded, so it feels like the amount of time you spend on it is not rewarded, and you can only prove your knowledge of it on the test. I felt that the grades are so heavily concentrated on in class essays and tests that it is very stressful, especially because they are graded toughly. In fact, I felt frustrated a few times by the way tests were graded because they felt very subjective even if the teacher and I agreed my answer was correct, it was not good enough for her. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was fantastic. Motivated students can put in a lot of work in the areas that interest them. I spent a lot of time focused on anthropology, religion, and history. A student interested in improving their grammar may invest time in that, or students interested in improving their conversation skills can go out an talk to people. The Spaniards tend to be really chatty, and there are a lot of students and student hang-outs in Valencia. There is a lot of unscheduled time, which means that motivated students can pursue what is most interesting to them at the pace that they want. I personally took advantage of it. \r\n\r\nI will say that it would be great to do more coursework with Valencian students. I know it's their summer, but if they have summer courses, it would be great to have an option to sit in on class with the UCV students. Since our class was Yale-only, the standard for conversation and comments were different than being in a classroom with students working in their own language at a high academic standard. Having our class was great because we could go at our own pace and the topics were flexible each day, but to also have the opportunity to test my abilities in a Spanish-speaking university would have been awesome.\r\n\r\nMy one other suggestion is that those students who have home placements more than a 25 minute walk from campus be subsided for a bus pass. For me the walk to class was around 35 minutes; because I am a fast walker, I could make it in 25 if I hustled. For the first two weeks, I varied my routes every day so that I would always be walking a different way each time. After that, I wanted more time to explore the farther areas of the city and going from class to lunch at home each day (the standard cultural practice) and then back to the city took a large chunk out of the day. I started taking the bus to and from class, which cost around 45 euros on bus passes, which was the majority of what I spent out-of-pocket.  I noticed all the university students and professors in the area used university bus passes; perhaps being able to get the student discount would be helpful. The homestay and meals each day are provided for within the cost of the program; I think it is reasonable to also consider subsidizing public transport for those students who do live far away from the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is the homestay program.\r\n\r\nOne weakness could be not having excursions every Tuesday and Thursday. ",
            "\u00a0I really did not see any weaknesses in this course. The material was well facilitated for student learning; everything (assignments, excursions, and due dates) were outlined in the syllabus prior to the start of the program. Specific and important information was also posted on Canvas, so that all would know what to do when. The professor and teaching assistant were extremely encouraging, cared about all in class,  and worked hard to ensure that students were learning the information and had a safe trip. If anybody had a question, both were quick to reply and very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the strengths of this course are that it is complete immersion in Spain through everyday life, in the classroom and at home, which forces us to practice and think more in Spanish. We gain exposure through class but our best learning moments our when we are together on excursions or out in the city. It allows us to keep speaking to each other in Spanish and soon enough it becomes easier to converse with others. I think that the class readings were mildly difficult later on in the course which made class discussion difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I loved pretty much everything, especially the home stay. One thing I'd fix is the debate. I wish we all got to participate, as only half the class was able to, and it also seemed like a lot at the end of the fifth week. It would've been nice to incorporate the theme of the debate into the whole class (also, I'm not sure if pro/against immigration reform is really a great topic for debate). I think the debate could've been a lot more engaging had we covered another issue, like that of week 1 with the water crisis in el Mediterrneo. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Incredible experience. One of my favorite things I have done at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a wonderful way to learn Spanish. Works better if the group is willing to commit to speaking out of class. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome program. Definitely would recommend. Not too hard and an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Great way to engage with a country and fully develop your language skills. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, an amazing experience that will take your Spanish language skills to the next level. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good program for improving spanish, but I found it very frustrating and felt there wasnt enough room to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to self-motivated students with a lot of personal discipline OR to adventurous students who are comfortable traveling alone. Because there is so much unscheduled time, it is up to you to make the best use of it. If you are a student who likes to have homework and assignments to keep you on track, this course likely is not the best for you. But if you are a student who can put your mind to something and follow it through on your own, this program gives you the time and the space to do that. And, the final paper topic is extremely flexible, so you are welcome to write about your personal adventures on your own. \r\nAlso, if you are an adventurous student, you would benefit greatly; the unscheduled time means that you can travel on your own. To go to other cities via the train can be as little as 4-10 euros, and to traverse the country (via BlaBlaCar - a ride sharing service) can cost around 25 euros. Food is really cheap - a fresh sandwich at a local bakery can be around 2 euros, and an Air B&B can be highly economical also. The catch is that you must be self-motivated to do this; your classmates, in the typical Yale fashion, will likely dither about traveling independently and then flake at the end. You have to be comfortable to go alone. I was really lucky and near the end of the program, I went on two great trips with a classmate. Otherwise, I typically went out alone. It depends on who is in your program. In the end, you must be organized, self-motivated, and adventurous to make it happen. Otherwise, it won't. \r\n\r\nI will add, that for women, Valencia and almost all of the Spain I saw, always felt to me really safe; everything is well lit, and there are always people around. I also felt comfortable traveling on my own; people are really friendly and happy to help out should you need directions or anything. I never had any problems being cat-called, followed, threatened, or anyone trying any inappropriate behavior - it's actually really lovely, and there's a noticeable difference. I'm also quite tan, and I had no problems with race - no one talked down to me, made underhand remarks, followed me in a store, flagged me for security, etc. After the first two weeks of being treated how I should be made me realize how badly I'm actually treated in the U.S. and how much I tolerate in the U.S and at Yale by comparison. I know Spain has its own problems; if you're observant and listen carefully, they're there. But really, to live for a month in Spain was a novelty for me. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. There is no better way to learn and master a foreign language than to study it intensively in a completely immersive program. This course offers that opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course (and already have!); the course not only focuses on academic growth in knowledge and Spanish skills, but also on personal growth. Everybody needs to have a chance to step out of their comfort zones and explore unknown parts of the world on their own. I have greatly enjoyed the places visited, the course itself, and the friendships cultivated during my program abroad. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that this course and program are an excellent opportunity to improve your Spanish between classroom and out-of-classroom experiences. The class itself wasn't overly difficult. It had components of an advanced grammar course but also of a course from about the L4 level or maybe a little higher. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend. Studying abroad was incredible. If you're looking to improve your Spanish, this is how to do it. The experience has motivated me to continue taking Spanish classes (currently trying to refine the grammar that I've forgotten from high school Spanish) and definitely aim for a Spanish certificate. But if you're not interested in learning Spanish and only going for a fun vacay, this program probably isn't for you. "
