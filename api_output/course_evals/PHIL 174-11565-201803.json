You learn all about what metaethical ideas are out there, and what philosophers think about what morality \"is.\" It's not necessarily information you use on the street, but it's very interesting and makes you think a lot. I think the biggest strength of this class is it really makes you consider arguments and logic and figure out what ideas can make sense. It really is valuable in that sense. ",

            "\u00a0This course was extremely strong, in terms of content I have no suggestions. From everyone who I have talked to who did the reading, the reading was really high quality. Unfortunately, there was no incentive to do the reading in terms of the course (the lectures didn't respond to it, and it was seldom brought up in section) so with a busy course load, I didn't ultimately do the reading. I would love to see the readings more emphasized in section so that there is an incentive to do them. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is that Kagan really knows his field and give a stimulating lecture. His manner is extremely natural and conversational, yet he always knows exactly what he wants to say and can defend his points. And the material is interesting, especially when you think about it more. My section was interesting and genuinely fun too.\r\n\r\nMain problem of the course was that it was hard to follow the broader arc or outline. The assignment for the final essay listed a dozen questions we had supposedly discussed -- I couldn't remember anything we said about most of them. Readings were left almost completely unused (even though they were interesting and could have added a lot!) \r\n\r\nI also wished I had a better idea at the outset what we would be discussing. I thought we would discuss the question \"why be moral\" -- but actually, the class was about considering (and usually rejecting) as series of specific skeptical attacks trying to prove that objective morality can't exist. Even rejecting all of these attacks, I was still left without any positive reason to \"be moral\".\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to take this opportunity to continue what I'm sure is a decades-long tradition of complaining about Prof. Kagan's grading scheme. As is well known, Kagan grades on a completely different scale from the rest of Yale college (median on the first essay was a C+). This has the predictable effect that a majority (or at least a very large plurality) of students either drop the class or take it credit/D, as I did. The fact that I knew I wouldn't get a grade inevitably sapped my motivation  especially on the essays (I could have met with my TA to discuss and improve them rather than writing them the night before, but I had to prioritize other work). The ironic part is that I would have been willing to work hard and risk a mediocre grade if the curve were merely very difficult, as opposed to unreasonable. The end result is that the students learn less. The only good motivation I can think of for grading this way is to identify the small minority of students who are truly gifted and committed to philosophy and separate them from those who are merely smart, or have a passing interest. This is a worthwhile goal, but not in a 100 level course. I hope you don't dismiss me as a bitter or grade-grubbing as I said, I came into this simply because I liked the material and knowing ahead of time that I would credit/d anyway-- I'm only saying I would have gotten more out of the class had I seen taking it for a grade as a realistic option. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness of the course is its absurd grading scale, which serves a demoralizing purpose more than any other. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kagan's lectures are always engaging, clear, and given with enthusiasm. He actively encourages students to voice questions and doubts during lecture, which I found incredibly beneficial. Sections are engaging, and having a good TA reduced the initial anxiety I felt about the strict grading system for section participation. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be better organized to begin with basics of epistomology and metaphysics as a background and that the reading list could include some more important, pivotal works of philsophy ",
            "\u00a0This has the potential of being a strong class. It is different from a typical philosophy class at Yale because of its second-order nature. I do not think that the course was not designed with growth in mind, regardless of whether it is considered in the calculation of final grades. I appreciate the enthusiasm Shelly has and the knowledge he has, but I believe that there was a serious disconnect between him and the TFs when it comes to the structure of the course and what students should be getting out of it. My section was dominated by students who consistently provided hot-takes (sorry for the colloquialism) about the broader themes without displaying any serious engagement with the true material whatsoever. What is disheartening is that they were rewarded for this mode of behavior due to a lack of intervention from my TF. In order for philosophical discussions to be productive, open, and understanding, everyone should have the opportunity to engage with the material, not something that another student has simply pulled out of thin-air without seriously considering. I believe that the fact that many take this course Credit/D creates this unfortunate consequence as they simply try to get their participation grade without considering how such laziness affects others. ",
            "\u00a0Good lectures, interesting topic for the class.\r\n\r\nSection could have been a bit more organized and readings seemed incidental/were barely brought up in lecture/section. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate the honesty of the grading, but I think that if there were more assignments throughout the semester that I would have seen more development in the skills that the course focuses on. ",
            "\u00a0It's professor and materials were great. The engagement of students during lecture was also good.  Given the tough grading, I think a clearer outline of the expectations would've been benificial. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic foundation of the strengths and weaknesses of moral realism and skepticism. The largest weakness was that we never actually made any headway into the content. Because there was so much to learn we were only able to scratch the surface. Moreover, we never actually figured out if moral skepticism was or was not a valid point. In other words, we learned individual theories but not how they overlapped and which position (overall) was stronger. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter is interesting, the lectures are engaging. However, I feel like the way we cover material is sometimes superficial, or sacrifices breadth over depth to an excessive degree. We tend to go over broad controversies in many of the areas we are discussing, and when we start analyzing arguments, we usually reach a point of \"eh, this looks very complicated, so we will not go into it any longer, but here's a brief outline of what some people think\". This class is great at showing how to get to those complicated points in metaethics. It is lacking in its ability to show how so solve those complications. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear, interesting lectures from Kagan; good TA'ing. Course is mainly episodic but there are themes and ways of thinking that permeate the course and tie it together nicely.\r\nWeaknesses: Slow grading. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the discussion section. Thats where you really get the opportunity to explore these ideas yourself. The weakness is that its not really organised in terms of learning. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting although it gets a bit predictable. The greatest strength of the course are Shelly Kagans engaging lectures and his high standards for writing. It is only because has high expectations that I was forced to try and meet them. In his class the grade you receive on a paper actually holds meaning and is not inflated and the feedback on the papers is invaluable. Also meeting with the TAs is extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are interesting, but for people who have never had any exposure to ethics/philosophy, the class is by no means an intro class. I had to seek a ton of outside help on my own and the TAs were hard to reach/inaccessible, and also just very busy. Philosophy writing is VERY different and the class is graded EXTREMELY harshly, so without a proper foundation and a lot of outside help, the class is very difficult, even if you put a tremendous amount of work in.

            "\u00a0Strengths: the class covers a lot of material so it feels like you get a survey of the important arguments about morality and it encourages people to come to their own conclusions. Also, if Shelly Kagan is teaching, the lectures are incredibly animated. Additionally, the papers in the class provide great feedback on how to write philosophy well.\r\nWeaknesses: some of the reading is not entirely helpful and the structure/order of the lectures can be confusing.

Professor Kagan is an engaging if exaggerated professor, and the course content doesn't presuppose any knowledge of philosophical literature, which is rare among Yale courses. (I'm not sure it would even help much.) \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the workload of the course consists entirely of three papers, and the grading and feedback is so awfully slow that you're pretty much on your own for every paper, despite Professor Kagan's emphasis on improvement over time.
