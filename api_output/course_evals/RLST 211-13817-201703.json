            "\u00a0I learned how to read philosophical texts, pick out common threads across very different texts, write analytical philosophy papers, and discuss these ideas during our class time. Thinking about the questions that medieval Chinese scholars were grappling with at the time helped me gain a new perspective on modern questions. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about philosophy in Medieval China. Really solid mix of majors and background in the room, but also lots of section a-holes. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I gained not only a fair amount of knowledge about medieval Chinese literature, but an appreciation for a different world of thought that exists outside of anything that I have studied. ",
            "\u00a0Most of all, in this class I learned a skill set for writing philosophy papers. I had taken no Western philosophy courses before and in this class I was most interested in writing about philosophical texts. Because I was writing in a way I never had before, the papers were quite challenging but also very rewarding.\r\n\r\nI also learned the importance of a kind of intellectual history which focuses on the time periods in which \"classical\" ideas are canonized and the people who canonize them. These people can have as much or more impact as the writers of the original texts. This course was heavy in commentary and I always found it fascinating how much commenters were willing to deviate from the original text in order to make their own arguments. Many really just used the original texts as a springboard for their own ideas. \r\n\r\nFinally, I learned that intellectual traditions can be more syncretic than they appear. In this class, it was very difficult to set strict boundaries between Ruist, Daoist, and Buddhist material even when texts self-identified as one of the three because they influenced and borrowed from each other considerably. I suspect this quality is common to other intellectual traditions that people may think of as being different or even opposed. ",
            "\u00a0I gained some real insight into the Chinese philosophical tradition and also improved my ability to analyze poetry and other literary texts. I used close reading skills a lot and learned how to structure arguments in ways that address philosophy, history, literature and many other things. ",
            "\u00a0This is quite simply one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Bender is a dynamic seminar leader who devotes more time to his students than almost any other teacher I've had. And his students respond in kind: you'd be lucky to find a more engaged classroom at Yale. The course material itself is fascinating -- you read your way into a world of medieval philosophical debates that remain strikingly relevant today. This is not a course to miss. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to the intellectual world of Medieval China. I had not studied any of the texts on the syllabus before, so the course offered an initial look at what was for me an entirely new intellectual tradition. The variety of forms we discussed -- religious scriptures, metaphysical treatises, fictional narratives, lyric poetry, art... -- made each seminar a valuable exercise in reading for philosophical connections and contrasts across genres. "

            "\u00a0It was a very engaging class and I felt like everyone was able to contribute towards the class discussion. The texts we read were very interesting and well-organized so that each one built on the previous ones. There were a lot of readings, however, and I felt like we never got to thoroughly discuss each week's readings because there was just too much good stuff. Also, the class was pretty large, and the discussion could get scattered as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The concept of this class is really great, and read material that you cannot learn anywhere else (the professor does a ton of the translation himself!) but sometimes the readings were too inaccessible to be helpful. Continuity from week to week was sometimes lacking. It felt like the same people dominated every discussion. Best use of Canvas discussion board that I've seen in any class at Yale. The \"debate\" over immortality was pointless. ",
            "\u00a0I almost wish that we had more papers, just so that I could have engaged more deeply with more of the materials of the course, but I found that the workload of the course was sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course, I think, was the construction of the syllabus. I thought the texts were really well-selected because of how much they referred to each other and fit together. Professor Bender is also a great discussion leader. Lastly, I was really grateful to have people from different backgrounds in the class who could add very different perspectives to the texts. \r\n\r\nAnother strength, I thought, was that the required reading was enough so that I never felt I exhausted it, but not so much that I ever struggled to complete it. I also really enjoyed writing the lengthy blog posts, and I thought the weekly discussion threads were phenomenal. \r\n\r\nI didn't think there was a real weakness to the class, but I think it can (and will) improve over time. One topic I wished had been discussed a little more was how much impact the ideas of the thinkers in the medieval period had going forward. I was attracted to the class in part because it seemed to be a really critical period for establishing debates that would continue on for centuries. Though the texts we read were very rich, I did not get a sense week to week about why this period was more worthy of studying than any other. Maybe there's a reason sitting in the syllabus that I just missed. Still, I wish this had been more clear. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bender is amazing. He is so knowledgeable but also very down to earth and did a great job teaching a class where everyone's background knowledge was at such different levels. The discussion was great, I loved the material, and I really enjoyed going to class each week. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were very free-flowing, which was fun and educational, but as a result we never really got to all of the readings. Maybe it would have been better twice a week? ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was Professor Bender's command of the syllabus. The readings were frequently challenging -- most weeks, I felt as though I understood very little before the seminar. Every week, however, Professor Bender guided the discussion to uncover connections between the various texts of this intellectual tradition. Without the excellent seminar discussions, this course would have been felled by its ambitious and diverse syllabus; instead, this variety became its strength. A future version of this course could perhaps prune a few selections: we rarely had time to touch on the smaller side readings, for example. With such rich texts, however, a future class could certainly explore paths that we did not choose. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in Chinese philosophy and want to learn more in a very supportive environment! Prof. Bender will help you through these very dense texts and you will come away with a greater appreciation for these schools of thought. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to someone interested in philosophy who's curious about China. Bender is a great teacher, but the class was definitely targeted towards a certain demographic. It's really hard to tell where the class is going to go from the first two weeks, and it's cross-listed in a ton of departments. There were definitely some kinks associated with this being the first year the class was taught, and it will probably be cleaner in the next iteration. Pretty standard workload - weekly Canvas posts, 5 pg midterm paper, 10 pg final paper. No outside research necessary for either paper, which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I would recommend this course to anyone from East Asian studies majors to physics majors, as it provides a uniquely thorough window into an entire culture's worth of thought without requiring any prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This course will probably only attract a small group of students. Still, it's a remarkable class with a remarkable professor. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those with any remote interest in East Asian literature, religion, or philosophy. Bender is brilliant and a very dedicated teacher. Not a walk in the park, but this you'll learn a ton and the readings will probably change the way you think. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially a philosophy major who has mostly taken western phil courses. The class is a bit philosophy heavy, which I liked, but also has some poetry and literature woven throughout. Class discussion was excellent and Professor Bender was great at making the material interesting and bringing out our ideas in helpful ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a course that you could only take at Yale. Literally: many of the texts you read are translated by Professor Bender. If you're someone like me who hasn't engaged much with the Chinese tradition but is looking to do so before leaving college, this is the course to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for an interdisciplinary examination of the Chinese intellectual tradition. If the Chinese intellectual tradition is new to you, as it was to me, Professor Bender's excellent teaching will make them accessible. I suspect that students who have encountered some of these texts before will find new value in the varied syllabus: these texts defy easy categorization, making each seminar discussion both challenging and rewarding.
