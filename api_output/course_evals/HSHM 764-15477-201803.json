            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot of valuable things about current thinking among Indigenous scholars, as well as about decolonial efforts within and outside of the academy more broadly. It also taught me a lot about how to think about engaging with Indigenous scholarship and thought in my own work, as a non-Indigenous person. Finally, the course offered some useful critiques of and concrete alternatives to the Anthropocene concept, which I will bear in mind in my future work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various framings of the anthropocene and was exposed to so many Black and Indigenous authors working to expand and refute that space. This course was different than other classes I've taken at Yale and I am so thankful for the chance it gave me to broaden my perspective and open up context for my other studies. ",
            "\u00a0This course and Professor Todd single-handedly changed the way I think about concepts as the environment, the Anthropocene, and the climate. I am indebted to her and to the syllabus for skills to identify and hopefully undo settler colonial logics and anti-black ideologies (among other oppressive systems) that permeate mainstream environmental discourse. I learned about responsible and decolonizing citational praxis as its importance to participants in academia. ",
            "\u00a0New ways of thinking about human/non-human relationships with (and within) the environment ",
            "\u00a0My first comprehensive course in Indigenous Studies thank you so much Dr. Todd for that! ",

        [
            "\u00a0The course is somewhat eclectic, which could be seen as a strength or a weakness. On the one hand, it exposed me to a variety of theories and disciplines that I might not otherwise have been exposed to. But it also meant that the class felt much more like an exploration and growing awareness of a problem than a clearly defined course with a clear arc. In the end, I think this is a strength of the class, but it is unusual. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the format of the course, and the discussions we had in class were some of the best of any class I've had here. ",
            "\u00a0This course was both introductory and deeply engaged, and the assignments were constructive in both content and in practical graduate-student ways (i.e. a chance to work on personal research and a taste of peer review processes). I thought that was brilliant. Our conversations were fun and engaging and critical. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal classroom atmosphere. Professor Todd nourishes a dynamic and compassionate classroom. She gets visibly excited by student contributions and asks thoughtful questions that demonstrate how actively she is listening. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course! "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in decolonial thinking, indigenous studies, and/or the Anthropocene. It certainly makes you think! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Everyone needs to think through these concepts, particularly anyone who's taken one of the other \"anthropocene\" courses that are based on white colonist thought. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I wish Professor Todd was here to stay! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Professor Todd is brilliant and sweet, as are the students that would elect to take such a class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Particularly students in who are working on histories and presents of climate change and ecological science. Learning to read for the epistemic silences and sites of erasure in mainstream anthropocene discourse is absolutely imperative for developing a comprehensive understanding of why we are where we are and how we got there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! "
