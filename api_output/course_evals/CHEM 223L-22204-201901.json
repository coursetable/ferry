            "\u00a0Strengths: That it builds on skills from last semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Towards the end of the semester, some of the labs seem repetitive in the types of skills we use to complete them. ",
            "\u00a0Have a practice exam before lab practical ",
            "\u00a0I wished that we could have done actual NMR to become more familiar with it. I liked how chill it was. The grading was harsh and nitpicky but I think that was just my TA. Professor DiMeglio is very kind, welcoming, and receptive to questions. The material is easy to understand when integrated with lecture materials and it is very easy to do well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0At times it is very difficult to understand why you are losing points on assignments.  Rubrics effectively do not exist, since the standard is \"correct/perfect content, professionally presented,\" which translates to \"we can take off an unlimited amount of points for whatever we want.\"  Of course, if you get a kind TA you can get feedback and good scores, but if your TA gives above-average scores, you will be curved down at the end of the semester.  The only redeeming aspect is that the lab practical is multiple choice.  For context: I had great TAs both semesters, but I would still not recommend the course.  It is just not set up in a way that students can understand exactly what is expected of them.  Do not take this class if it is not required. ",
            "\u00a0HNMR was not as emphasized as a required skill as I would have liked, but otherwise everything was cool. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lab is not stressful every week and the workload is definitely manageable. Dr. D is also very helpful and loves to answer questions! Also you're not graded on yield, which is good, because sometimes yield would be super low.\r\nWeakness: A lot of time spent in lab was not necessarily for the reaction itself, but rather for product characterization (always TLC, mp, IR) which actually takes a while to do each time. Although useful for analysis on post lab assignments, it seemed a bit redundant to do it every week for labs that we didn't turn in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course kept me very engaged, and it also taught me a lot of lab safety skills and chemical synthesis skills. This course also helped me become a better scientific writer, especially with regards to lab notes and writing scientific reports.\r\n \r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is definitely the amount of hands on experience each student gets by working individually on each experiment. ",
            "\u00a0Course was overall well structured and experiments generally worked. Some reactions involved pretty long refluxes though, but the timing was pretty well thought out so that there wasn't too much waiting time. ",
            "\u00a0So much busy-work. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs and Dr. DiMeglio were always very helpful throughout the labs. We learned a lot of techniques related to synthesis and characterization. We also learned mechanisms of reactions that related to what we were learning in organic chemistry class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs, the instructor, and the environment of the lab! It is very friendly and allows you to be relaxed during your experiments and not be afraid of making mistakes and telling them to the instructors. \r\nWeaknesses: The rubrics for some of the assignments ",
            "\u00a0As is often the case with lab courses, the grading is fairly whack. While the grades are curved based on TF's, the entire process is still very unclear. ",
            "\u00a0one weakness is that we kind of did the same thing every week (synthesis of some compound and then maybe purification and then characterization). also the material in lab didn't line up with material in lecture, so that was somewhat annoying. ",
            "\u00a0seemed like we did reflux every week. It was applicable with what we were learning reaction-wise in class but I'd rather learn different lab techniques. also sometimes the requirements for what was needed in lab notes or on different assignments was unclear or inconsistent. i appreciate that the only major work from week to week was EPs since the course is only a half credit despite being more class time than any other course ",
            "\u00a0This course is graded harshly, but the work is definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by allowing students to experiment more instead of giving them strict procedures. ",
            "\u00a0The labs were well designed and the assignments were clear. Dr. Dimeglio was always readily available and approachable and made a real effort to get to know all of us, which I really appreciated. Grading could have been made a little clearer - it always felt like with the post-lab assignments that grading was somewhat arbitrary (sometimes I would lose points for things, othertimes I wouldn't) and it would have been helpful to have a clearer rubric rather than guessing what we had to include in order to get points. I think NMR lecture should be done by Dr. DiMeglio in a large pre-lab lecture, such as is typical in gen chem. I think I started off with a poor understanding, which really came around to haunt me by the time the final came around. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that we got hands on experience and weren't graded on yield or purity, but were just expected to put in our best effort. I didn't love how the post lab assignments were graded - I felt like I was always losing points for not putting down something that the question didn't ask for. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Dimeglio. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty straightforward. I do have an issue with the subjectivity of the grading for a lot of the assignments. Many times grades fluctuated greatly depending on the TF that you were assigned to. This seemed to be unfair to those who had a harsher grader versus those who had a more lenient grader. ",
            "\u00a0It is what it is. I think the experiments are good at showing us the applicability of organic chemistry in real life. For example, I really enjoyed the dilantin and the tylenol synthesis because they showed us that organic chemistry helps people in their daily life. Of course there are weaknesses that everybody will complain about like inconsistent grading and long lab hours etc, but it just is what it is and you likely just have to take it. One really bad weakness though, is that the instructions on the post lab assignments look deceivingly clear. Things are outlined in the guide to scientific writing or whatever, but then when you receive your grades, you realize you got points off for not talking about some aspect about the experiment, but was not listed anywhere in the expectations or the rubric/guidelines. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that its extremely organized. From day one of the course, each lab session is mapped out so students can plan accordingly for the semester. The instructor, Christine DiMeglio, is a major strength -- she is a gem who genuinely wants everyone to learn and is so sweet and helpful during lab. One weakness is the wide range in TAs - some TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful during lab, while others work more as a chaperone who are just making sure nothing explodes. The structure of Post Lab assignments could be better- they are so sporadic throughout the semester that I dont think they fosters as much learning and growth about scientific writing as they could. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I feel like the material of this course lacks breadth. Both my friends at state schools and the grad students I work with expressed surprise at the fact that we don't make Grignards, do Birch reductions (or use a -78 C bath ever), or visualize TLC with anything but UV. It's made me worry somewhat that I'm less prepared than my friends for internships or lab work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the organization. The weakness was the huge difference in grading amongst different TFs. ",
            "\u00a0Great TAs that dont beat around the bush and help to the best of their abilities. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-structured and helps students feel comfortable with organic synthesis and analysis. Dr. DiMeglio does a great job making sure that students are engaged but not too stressed out about the class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall good course, and for a lab class very straight forward and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0less repetitive techniques, sometimes it felt like we were doing similar things over and over again ",
            "\u00a0A very informative and engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0The staff and TAs are wonderful, helpful, approachable people who make the lab (which is mandatory for most things) actually enjoyable. But it is a 4 hour lab which is difficult and not always fun. In terms of improvement, one of the newer labs (I forget which but this was its second year) needed more extensive preparations so that the staff would know how to work out all of the kinks involved in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Overall good. Would be cool to learn different techniques or types of reactions since almost every week is just reflux and then the same 3 evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0I like how this course is very organized and every lab of the semester is already mapped out exactly at the beginning of the year. One weakness is that some of reactions performed in lab had not been covered in the orgo class yet, so we were learning things for the first time (by ourselves), and implementing it in the EPs without knowing if our knowledge of it was correct. Additionally, the CHEM 175 and 221 classes were also learning things at different paces, thus resulting in some students knowing the material while some students were learning it on the spot. ",
            "\u00a0It is an interesting class that is a great complement to applying the lecture material. The downside is that synthesis is long and boring, and gets repetitive towards the end of the semester. In addition, it can be physically tiring to stand up for that long. The lab benches are very uncomfortable to write on. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized, with exciting labs every week that make compounds relevant in our everyday lives.  Unlike gen chem lab, the weekly time commitment is quite fair and peaks around the 2 lab reports you will have to write. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was not bad. The only big thing I would improve is to prepare us a little better for the big post lab assignments because they kind of just pop up, and you have to do them. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized in order to promote student learning. The course materials are detailed and very informative, the curriculum follows a clear structure, feedback is given for all assignments, and the teaching staff are very approachable and involved in the day-to-day labwork. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the well-organized course packet, the pre-lab EPs, and the hands on assistance by the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0The grading for the post-lab reports could get annoying sometimes, as the directions were general but the rubrics were specific. Sometimes it felt like the work valued quantity over quality. ",

Additionally, for the post labs, the information on formatting is spread out confusingly over multiple documents on canvas and the examples of how each section are supposed to look actually don't match the instructions. This leads to great confusion over what good \"scientific writing\" actually looks like. Another weakness of the course is that what we get graded on is actually pretty irrelevant to the point of the lab course. The final multiple choice test is a hodgepodge of material that is sort of covered in the course packet but has nothing to do with our actual lab abilities. In the future, I would recommend having a lab practical as the final. ",
