            "\u00a0During the first semester of my two-semester senior thesis, I read pretty freely on moral psychology and the moral emotions. I honed skills in directing my own learning and in developing my own topic of interest, and also in philosophical researchfiguring out who to read on a topic. ",
            "\u00a0With Professor Shin and another student, I gained foundational knowledge on the philosophy of mathematics, the perennial problems it debates, and its history/context. I also gained knowledge in the specific field of my final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an insight into how in-depth scholarship within the field of philosophy is carried out. I honed the skills I have acquired in the past 3 years studying philosophy. I also learned a lot about Charles Sanders Peirce and mathematical philosophy in general. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Having a thesis advisor I could work with and communicate with well. The freedom to pursue a topic of your own interest. Suggestions for improvement: The philosophy department could consider providing more information on the website or online for students thinking of doing a senior essay, for instance, how to find a field of interest, how to develop a topic, some guidelines on timeline for working on a senior essay. I didn't have much issues with figuring this all out with my thesis advisor, but it would definitely be beneficial to students to have more guidelines from the department. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great tutorial! I enjoyed the structure of reading an overview text together and then splitting into a more narrow topic for the essay. ",
            "\u00a0This course is the best it can be. There should be more courses structured like this that one can take not only during senior year. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed this senior tutorial very much, and would recommend to other math and philosophy majors who are perhaps uninterested in writing their senior essay in one of the offered philosophy classes, and would like something more at the intersection of the major. ",
