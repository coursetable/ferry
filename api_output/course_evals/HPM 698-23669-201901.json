Maybe a good assignment would be a debate. All this being said, I'm glad I was exposed to this material and have the lecture slides for future reference. ",

            "\u00a0This course was alright. I found it helpful to review core concepts from the fall semester policy and micro classes, however lectures were a bit dry. I enjoyed when Howie shared his opinions or solutions to problems because it got me thinking about how to address challenges in healthcare. While it was ultimately an extremely helpful exercise, I didn't think that the final project was relevant given course content and as a result was quite stressful to complete -- we did not discussed company valuation or financial modeling during the course. Furthermore, the course lacked clarity -- expectations were not clear for many assignments -- grading standards were often delivered through the grapevine, which was also challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the course is interesting, but I felt like we spent too much time on things that were already covered in Micro/Health Policy. Since all three are required for MPH HCM students, I think it would be better to limit the overlap. I don't need to learn about adverse selection or moral hazard again, but I would love to talk in greater depth about physician compensation. Also, for the final project, Howie asked questions about what should the company do if the stock is overvalued. I would have appreciated if he had taught us about that before. I didn't know how to do the financial analyses that people did for their final projects and I would have rather we covered that than the moral hazard stuff again. ",
