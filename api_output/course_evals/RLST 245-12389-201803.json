            "\u00a0I learned about the Amarna period in Egypt in great depth + the religious, cultural, and societal context surrounding the era. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a historical, artistic, philological, and philosophical approach to the Amarna Period. ",
            "\u00a0Biggest takeaway: So much of what is considered to be \"factual knowledge\" of ancient Egypt is actually based on scarce archaeological evidence, and a whole lot of conjecture. A lot of pop literature I've read references Nefertiti as someone who ruled as pharaoh after her husband's death. Actually, that's based on about 3 inscriptions in which a post-Akhenaton ruler is referred to as \"Ankhe(t)perure Neferneferuaton\" - which just as easily, and possibly more feasibly, could be referring to Akhenaton's oldest daughter. We don't really know! My general point was: going more in depth in this class made me look at general historical pop knowledge more closely. \r\n\r\n2nd takeaway: Akhenaton was an overall interesting human. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a point in history which I knew little to nothing about before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the 18th Dynasty traditions and religion. I also learned specifically about the vast changes in art, culture, and religion during the reign of one particular king, Akhenaton. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Egyptian history, art, culture, and religion. I really feel like we went very in depth, which I loved. I feel like I have an excellent grasp of this time period of Egypt. ",
            "\u00a0learned so much about Egypt and the surrounding areas in the new kingdom! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Egyptology and how to critically analyze the Middle Kingdom period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an unnecessarily large amount about the 30 weirdest years in Egyptian history. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course, with lectures given in a rather narrative form that keeps students interested and engaged. Small quizzes and take-home assignments keep students up-to-date on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Attention grabbing history class! Great for non-majors and majors! Even if you're not usually into history, this class will keep you attending because the content is so naturally wild, and also the Prof is really dynamic! Very reasonable workload and mix of quizzes, papers, and a midterm! Akhenaton!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We could have used a bigger classroom - sometimes it was hard to find seats. Slides could probably be labeled better, specifically when there are lots of diagrams or photos. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was great, with the exception that lectures can sometimes get a bit repetitive, but you're still learning enough new information that it's interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a great curriculum laid out for it, but there is almost too much material to cover and some of the intended material had to be cut out to finish the course on time. The course could be improved just by laying out when the quizzes are in the curriculum so that students have some warning. They were not in the syllabus and were a surprise, which was stressful when they happened right during midterms. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible. Prof Darnell is a fantastic lecturer, and I have never been as engaged with a class as with this one. The material is engaging as well, but prof Darnell really makes it exciting. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0The professors passion for the subject was what made the class special, and quite engaging. Professor Darnell is a great teacher ",
            "\u00a0This course is very niche and covers only a very specific aspect of Egyptian history. But, nevertheless, the prof is great and the material is pretty engaging. I loved learning the military history aspects of the Akhenaten period. ",
            "\u00a0Because this course is so specific, it becomes possible to really dive deep into the topic.  This has a drawback too in that some of the information only seems to be tangentially related, and as a result, was less interesting to me. ",
            "\u00a0Great, passionate professor, who is very clear and understanding with the expectations about the course. Great communication on deadlines, due dates, changes, etc. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This course is interesting even for students who have no Egyptological background. ",
            "\u00a0PRAISE THE ATON. SPREAD THE WORD. ALL HAIL AKHENATON: KING OF KINGS, RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONARY, FATHER OF AMARNA DIPLOMACY, FATHER OF MANY MANY DAUGHTERS (AND ALSO KING TUT), HUSBAND OF NEFERTITI, THE OG REALPOLITIKER, THE WILDEST PARTY THROWER OF ALL EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY PHARAOHS WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF RAMSES II WHO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THREW SOME PRETTY CRAZY JUBILEES, AND ALSO AMENHOTEP III HAD SOME PRETTY MEMORABLE PARTIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF HIS REIGN NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, HE BUILT AN ENTIRE CITY FOR ONE OF HIS PARTIES BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE OTHER LOCATION OPTIONS, LIKE A LITERAL ENTIRE CITY AND PEOPLE LIVED THERE. IT WAS CALLED MALQATA. SO BASICALLY ALL THE 18TH DYNASTY PHARAOHS KNEW HOW TO PARTY. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THUTMOSE THE FIRST BECAUSE HE WAS TOO BUSY ATTACKING THE MITTANI AND CONQUERING THE NILE.\r\n\r\nTAKE THIS CLASS so that you too can embrace the knowledge of the Amarna Period in Egypt, and the wild 18th dynasty in general. EVEN IF you do not usually enjoy history classes, YOU WILL enjoy this one. Not only is it centered on fascinating subject material related to King \"The First Individual in History\" Akhenaton (he's actually called that a lot, look it up), it's also taught by the DYNAMIC Prof Darnell. YOU WILL LEARN. YOU WILL LEARN EVEN MORE. YOU WILL GO TO CLASSES EVEN IF YOU ARE USUALLY NOT ACADEMICALLY MOTIVATED. The material is strong. The quizzes are not pop quizzes. The writing assignments are very reasonable. TAKE THE CLASS.\r\n\r\nAfter taking this class YOU TOO, will announce the Aton to the world as: \"Re lives. Ruler of the Horizon, who rejoices on the Horizon in his name, Shu, who has returned as Aton.\" AND THEN you will announce that the Aton used to be known by a title that heavily referenced Re-Horakhty, a traditional sun-related deity, and was later changed to the more self-contained version seen above, which was possibly an effort by Akhenaton to make his religious revolution more easily digested by the masses who were used to traditional worship. ",
            "\u00a0PRAISE THE ATON. REJOICE IN THE SUN-DISK. BATHE IN ITS LUMINOSITY. LET IT CONSUME AND DEVOUR ALL YOUR BORING CLASSES AND REPLACE IT WITH ITS MAGIC. By far one of the most engaging and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale, although I do think that this is a function of how interested you are in Egypt in general, and whether your show up to every class. I'm telling you, the lectures make this course. Prof. Darnell is truly a gem and I hope he continues to spread his passion through his courses. He's also a black of hole of knowledge when it comes to the subject and one of the nicest professors I've ever had, so yeah, 10/10 recommend. Also I took this course for fun as a science major, and it is extremely accessible; the essays aren't difficult and the readings were very manageable and interesting. If you think Egypt is boring, you're wrong, and you need to take this class immediately. It will enrich your life. You will learn about all the wrong things you have learned about Egypt and numerous conspiracy theories regarding the spicy lives of pharaohs both before and after Akhenaton. This course gave me solace in the darkest of times and light in the depths of midterms and finals. GO FORTH. GO. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. Be aware that there is a decent amount of reading and work to do, but it's never truly difficult, just involved. Darnell's lecturing is wonderful, and his style orients the subject in history well. Really fun class overall, I enjoyed myself. Especially if you're interested in taking hieroglyphics, this class will be fun because the language is frequently discussed (but never tested!) and you pick up some fun words. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all my friends. The material itself was very interesting and the readings were relevant to what we were talking about in class. The class was very well taught and kept students engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! You go so in-depth to an era you know nothing about and you become incredibly captivated! Its so much fun to delve into all the aspects of one time period. Its fun and engaging and makes me want to take a bunch more egyptology classes. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to get knee deep in Egyptology, you got to take this course. Learning about Akhenaten is like learning about Jesus himself. ",
            "\u00a0Due to the divergent nature of Akhenaten's reign, it is also helpful to come in with a background in Ancient Egypt so that you can tell what is so different about Akhenaten compared to other pharaohs.  It is certainly not necessary, however.  If you have a background in Egypt, I highly recommend this course.  For others, I still would recommend it, but it will probably be a bit more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I personally was not very interested in the material, which could have made for a horrible course, but Professor Darnell is very passionate about it, which exuded in every lecture. "
