            "\u00a0I learned about my own artistic focus and ways to communicate that focus. ",
            "\u00a0This course is one that requires deep introspection and the class that has helped me to grow the most as an individual at Yale. Because the themes of the class -- archives, the family album, personal histories -- are intensely personal, the work you are required to make becomes intensely personal as well. I learned how to examine my personal life and feel comfortable with sharing it to a class that began as strangers, and this is one of the areas I grew the most in during this course. ",
            "\u00a0I got to work with software like iMovie to create short media projects. Also, I got practice with editing and refining my personal films. ",
            "\u00a0i learned so much about how film and home videos are some of the only ways that marginalized communities have gotten to share their narratives. there are so many different approaches to film and i've learned to analyze and appreciate a wide variety of styles. ",
            "\u00a0Archival research, fusion of personal narrative and communal archive, filmmaking, archives theory ",
            "\u00a0I'm very grateful to this course for giving me the tools and the freedom (but mostly the freedom) to explore a part of my family history that had been sealed off to me; to play with new creative forms; and to think through the relationship between archives, memory, and identity on an extremely personal level. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting readings and films, being able to watch other students' work is great and insightful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - discussion feels one-sided sometimes, like professor to students not professor and students. Confusion on if we are learning technical skills or not-- we should definitely be learning technical skills at least a little bit in this course ",
            "\u00a0The class is requires the filming and production of 3 short media projects throughout the course of the semester, but offers very little tools and resources to be able to achieve this. Most students used iMovie as their go-to editing software as no other alternatives were taught, and filmed on iPhones as a proctor did not come in to teach how to use the Yale-housed cameras until over halfway through the semester. I would appreciate if this course focused on more technical aspects of filming and editing in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good feedback on projects, allowed a great amount of creative license, provided opportunities for students to engage with professionals in the field \r\n\r\nWeakness: the course did not provide any foundational information about film production or camera work, which I thought I would get because it was a production course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: guest visits, movie screenings, the level of creative freedom granted to students, readings that are well paired with films\r\n\r\nweaknesses: no trainings or tips/tricks for beginners until the end of the course, engagement with professor & TA ",
            "\u00a0Amazing works, great Professor, great flexible workshop format, great artist visits, great variety of reading and film. Open ended assignments had fantastic results from all my classmates ",
            "\u00a0One of the main things that made Archive Aesthetics so special was its hybridity: part film studies class, part production seminar. But I also feel that this became its major weakness. There simply wasn't time enough to have meaningful discussions about the films we were (supposed to be) watching *and* give each student a chance to have their work seriously critiqued. My suggestion would be to either cut down on the assigned films and readings (so aiming for 2/3rds production seminar) or cap the class at a much smaller number. Probably both.\r\n\r\nOh, I almost forgot: bringing in filmmakers was a huge plus. "

            "\u00a0Yes; It helps to shape artistic focus but I  wouldn't say that anyone else is responsible for that facilitation except for the student. You choose what to engage with and that helps you. Professor and TA do help but more so with feedback ",
            "\u00a0If a student is looking to create in a personal way -- perhaps the hardest form to create in -- they should take this class. It is an extension class to the one offered by the same professor in the fall (which I HIGHLY recommend taking either on its own or before this class). It facilitates critical thought in a non-traditional way, which was extremely refreshing at a place like Yale. People interested in cultural, personal, and family stories -- regardless of major because growth will happen in any arena of study -- should absolutely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. I think the course needs to be more organized and provide more teaching of technical film production techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it was challenging in a way that was very fruitful and resulted in growth as a storyteller. ",
            "\u00a0short answer: yes\r\n\r\nlong answer: the level of intellectual rigor this course required was similar to other classes but i feel like it required much more time for film beginners. even though we were told in the beginning of the course that you're graded on effort and not actual product, for me, it was hard to see that seeing how advanced other students were. i think this is a really interesting class for people interested in the intersection of black history, film, and marginalized narratives. archives are such a fascinating thing to learn about. but it can be made much more beginner friendly from the get-go. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Such a great chance to explore deeply personally meaningful stories in a compelling way ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- given that some changes (see above) are made... "
