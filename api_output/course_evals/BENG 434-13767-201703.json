            "\u00a0This class was full of interesting information and knowledge about basic materials science, specific classes of materials that are used in the body, and the mechanical and biological impacts of each material. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the material properties and uses for polymers, ceramics/glasses, and metals. Then we explored composites, natural materials and tissue engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about biomaterials, truly understanding the content instead of just memorizing facts. I think it is quite useful as a biomedical engineer. I understand implants, the characteristics of different biomaterials (metals, polymers, ceramics/glasses, natural materials) and the body's response to biomaterials a lot more. ",

            "\u00a0This was my favorite class this year. I learned so much about all the incredible engineering picarions that exist in the biomedical world and the exciting research that is happening now. I.T is one of the reasons that I have now decided to pursue a graduate degree as an engineer ",
            "\u00a0I learned about what kinds of materials are used in biomedical engineering and why. I also learned how these materials are tested. "

            "\u00a0This class is extremely well-taught by Prof. Gonzalez and is super well-organized. The lectures are engaging and each unit concludes with a guest lecture, student presentations, and a review that really reinforce the information. In addition, some lectures include activities that help make clear the concepts that are difficult to visualize since they're on a microscopic scale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - lectures were well organized, the TA and Professor were always helpful; had a lot of student engagement\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the lectures were not completely finished during class (but only by a few slides) ",
            "\u00a0The course is built in an interactive way where the material is truly taught and not just made to memorize. We made nylon in class once, played jeopardy before every exam (which was extremely helpful to know what to study and to make sure you understood the material), and had other helpful (and fun!) class activities. Professor Gonzalez is amazing. She's an entertaining lecturer, really nice, and you can tell she wants everyone to actually learn. I highly recommend the course! One of the only things that I didn't like is that we didn't get our midterms back, we could only look at them briefly in class or go to office hours (which I couldn't make) to look at them since some of the final exam questions would be pulled from the midterms. This was hard because they would have been useful to learn better from if we had had access to the answer keys, to make sure we didn't make the same mistakes in the final. I think they should just be handed back. Another thing is that it was a bit annoying that the blog posts were due on Saturdays since they are a busy day with activities for me and when I'm most tired from a week full of deadlines. I think making them be due on Sunday night would be better. Lastly, I didn't like Professor Zhou who was the guest lecturer for several lectures. I felt like I didn't learn during his lectures, had a hard time understanding his slides and following along, which was reflected in my performance in the first midterm in the sections related to the content he taught. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught! I thought the pset/exam expectations were extremely reasonable given what was taught in lecture and covered in the readings! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gonzalez was very energetic and made the class very interesting and engaging. The material was interesting, but the pace of each class was a bit uneven and I felt like it went a bit too quickly at times, when we had to cram in material at the end of some of the classes. That being said, I really enjoyed the breadth of the material covered in the course and felt like I got a very good introduction to the materials used in biomedical engineering.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did wish was that we got our materials graded and returned more quickly; it would have been helpful to have more time to review them before the exams. I also wished that the exams had been structured a bit more evenly, so we didn't have so many lectures to cover in exam one versus exams two and three. "

            "\u00a0You should absolutely take this class. Prof. Gonzalez is the best at Yale--knowledgeable, caring, and a very engaging lecturer. The information is something that I found immensely interesting and useful. The workload isn't so little that it seems like a waste of time, but definitely manageable with a few psets, weekly blogs, one presentation, and two midterms. The work is definitely well-explained and you will not regret taking this class!! ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class was extremely well taught. The exams and the 3 homeworks were fair. There is a blog that you would also create which can be fun if you make the most out of it. Prof Gonzalez also held in class reviews before each exam which were organized into a jeopardy game where we got candy. It was always a highlight of my week. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend it! It's pretty fun and interesting. Great professor, not too much workload (only 3 problem sets that aren't too bad, 2 midterms, a group presentation, weekly blogs, and a final), and good content. The blog posts were annoying at times, but there are some weekends when they are not due and I actually learned from doing them. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially if youre a student who isnt sure about biomedical engineering or biology ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in biomedical engineering, material science, or just medicine in general. It's an interesting course, taught by an energetic, young, badass-woman-in-stem professor, which is unfortunately a rarity in Yale STEM. ",
            "\u00a0This course is less interesting than 435 (biomaterial tissue interactions) while also being graded more harshly, so I would recommend 435 instead. This isn't a bad course, but the blogs and homework assignments require more effort than you might expect, and expectations were not made clear. "
