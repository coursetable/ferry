            "\u00a0Learned so much about environmental policy and law in the NE region of the USA. Was an awesome class to learn about new and cross-cutting solutions to climate change! Would highly recommend, and was one of my favorite classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0So much to learn in this class, but its a great overview of policy and how policy can be used to create a better environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different sectors of energy policy and where they apply in real world applications. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed general knowledge into policy solutions to new threats posed by climate change and human impacts on the world. I have really developed skills in writing policy memo's and op-ed's. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the potential for amazing work to be done at the state level, which was really inspiring to me since I had always thought that meaningful climate policy needed to happen at the federal level. We learned how to think critically about the development and implementation of policies--particularly incorporating lenses of environmental justice/who wins/who loses into everything that we pitch. I also gained some policy memo writing and presenting skills which will help me present my thoughts and ideas in more concise and interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Connecticut's environmental policy and the many ways that we can create a sustainable society in the modern age. Also, I learned how to write a policy memo. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a really good in depth look at a lot of environmental policy issues - I tended to know about the problems existing but not about how anyone had tried to solve them with policy or otherwise. Generally a very helpful and interesting class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths - Learned so much about applicable policy and law, especially as it related to this region of the world. Was an awesome class!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized, but could have promoted class discussions by encouraging students to focus on specific readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the wide range of knowledge students can gain about current solutions being proposed to climate change threats. I also developed communication skills due to the class feeling like a comfortable place to express my thoughts. I think this course could have more guest speakers and a greater worldwide view on this topic rather than specifically on Connecticut. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Professor Klee is wonderful. He is so well prepared for each and every class, gave the most thorough and meaningful feedback I think I have received from any professor at Yale, and was very available outside of class for questions and additional conversations, all of which I really appreciated.\r\n- Workload is good, fairly even. The papers were manageable, spaced out, and took some time to write but we were also always well-prepared to write them.\r\n- Readings and topics are interesting, and the class is very well-organized and well-paced.\r\n- This is also just a really important topic of class to be taught, and I think it covered a good scope.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes I felt like the classes turned into lectures (super interesting lectures, but still lectures) with a few questions at the end, where it was harder to get a discussion going because we didn't have much time for that. Maybe some of the lecture material could be moved into a pre-class reading or slideshow and then open up discussion more in class, and have us press each other on our policies. I did have lots of thoughts on my peers' policy memos but didn't always feel like we had enough time to dissect them like the lectures dissected other policies and initiatives. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the latter half of the course when we discussed innovative ideas to address climate change and unsustainable living. Some discussions revealed differing opinions and values that people held, which was illuminating. This is not a fault of the class per se, but a lot of the learning was contingent on class discussions, so I feel like if the class were a bit more diverse in terms of people's backgrounds, the class could have been more productive. There were many readings provided and many of them were 70+ page documents on policy. As a college-level course, the primary goal of the course to me is not to learn all the minute details of the Clean Air Act but to challenge the way we think. Some readings were quite stimulating, and I feel like if the readings were narrowed down then I would have more incentive to read them all. Lastly, I felt that some of the things we learned in class could have been found online with some research. It would have been nice to dive deep into several prominent policies and to have a cross-cutting analysis to truly understand the intricacies of environmental policy. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course was that it provided a mix of both lecture and seminar style discussion. I learnt a lot of information but also learnt to develop my own ideas and discussions. "

            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! A must-take for anyone interested in the environment, climate change, law, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend, Rob is an incredible instructor and has a lot of real world knowledge! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed this class ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a very relaxed learning environment and i enjoyed the content. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. The subject material is just so interesting and important nowadays, and it really opens your eyes to what government CAN and DOES do when it is functioning properly and democratically. Prof. Klee is a wealth of knowledge and a huge support resource--definitely go to office hours, participate in class, do the readings, keep up on lectures, etc. Great feedback is given on all written assignments. Lots of important and practical skills developed, like policy memo writing, short pitch presentations, critical thinking about policies, and environmental justice consistently used as a lens of analysis rather than as just a topic for one class (a very important distinction from other classes I've taken). ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student's interest in Connecticut and climate policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I found it very interesting and engaging, and not an overwhelming amount of work for the amount that we learned. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this class as it was a refreshing course and unlike others that I had taken at Yale. Excellent professor, manageable workload, and engaging material! "
