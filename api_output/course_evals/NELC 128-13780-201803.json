            "\u00a0I read a variety of Near Eastern works from 2500 B.C. to 2007. I learned how to analyze a variety of storytelling methods, including epic poetry, songs, graphic novels, and prose. In addition to reading the literature, I spent time in the Yale's Babylonian Collection and learned about various aspects of ancient Mesopotamian culture, such as cuneiform writing. The class encompassed a wide range of geographical regions and languages, including the Fertile Crescent, Iran, and al-Andalus (Medieval Spain). ",
            "\u00a0I did a lot of textual analysis and by the end of the course felt that I had a better sense of the Near Eastern literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This course intrduced me to the rich history of literature from the Near East. Along with the class, I learned, read, and discussed key texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Old Testament, Pre-Islamic poetry, and recent Turkish fiction, among others. I learned how to analyze translated texts for important themes, images, and concepts. I also better understood the surrounding history and politics behind many of these texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about just how vast the Near Eastern literary tradition is and got a general sense of its most important works and its distinctive themes, motifs, features, etc. I also learned how to perform a proper close-reading of dense literary passages and how to express my thoughts about a piece of literature in a clear, concise piece of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various forms of writing, from analytical essays to graphic novels to poetry. Slanski selects a great selection of very interesting authors and works from the Near East. We learned not only about formal writing, but also about the cultural/historical development of the Near East through its literature. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great overview of 4000 years of literature in the Middle East, starting with Mesopotamia and going pretty much until the present. Students discover a wide array of texts and genres, try to establish themes that could form a literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This course was instrumental in developing a better sense of comprehending literature of the Near East. It helped to analyze the literature from a different perspective and truly get into the details. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was very well-structured, and the seminar format allowed for open discussion and lots of opportunities for class participation. The weekly reading responses ensured that assigned reading got done in a timely fashion. While the syllabus ended up getting changed several times throughout the semester, I felt that we spent an appropriate amount of time covering each time period/era of Near Eastern Literature. This was the first year this course has been offered, so I will attribute any \"weaknesses\" to structural difficulties that come with a new course. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the thematic coherence of the course. Since we emphasized themes that carried over from ancient literature to modern literature, I could situate the texts in conversation with each other. I loved the assignments because they provided a refreshing break from analytical essay-writing and forced me to think about the material differently. I also understand that this is a new course and as such, doesn't have a routine syllabus yet. However, I think the class could benefit from some further organization. We had to change the syllabus several times and sometimes I didn't know when assignments were due. ",
            "\u00a0One of the course's main strengths was a wonderfully-curated syllabus of really interesting pieces of literature. The course's seminar format I count as both a strength and a weakness -- the free-flowing nature of our class discussion meant that we got to talk about whichever aspects of the books we found interesting and dive deep into whichever themes/passages/etc we felt like dissecting, but I think that I would have maybe taken more away from the course if the discussions were more structured around predetermined takeaways for each piece of writing. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus contained practically every form of literature you could think of, which meant that we were constantly learning new perspectives and the material did not get monotonous. It was also a great way of learning about highly influential works outside of the Western canon. One weakness is that, at times, it felt that class time was not used as efficiently as it could have been, and a 75 minute period was spent on discussion of just one topic when we were supposed to cover more. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar setting of this course is really good - since there are so many different texts and inspirations, having students contribute to discussions every class, bringing their own perspectives enriches the class a lot. Furthermore, the texts are very well chosen, always interesting and not too long so that students actually have time to read them!\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved in the structure of the class was that we tended to focus a lot on a couple pages in the assigned readings, and I often left class thinking that there was so much more that we could have covered. But I guess that is also the marker of a good class! ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that it is a very interesting course that covers a variety of fascinating readings. It also is largely independent, making sure that the students work on their own and through class discussions. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether or not they have a prior interest in the subject. I, and most of the people in my class, came in with no previous knowledge of Near Eastern literature. The subject matter is fascinating, and the variety of history, languages, and cultures that gets covered in the class is very intellectually stimulating. The class was very interactive; we met in the Babylonian Collection, which allowed students to look at ancient artifacts on a weekly basis, and we had frequent visits from distinguished professors in the NELC department. We also went to the Beinecke and got to look at rare editions of some of the works we'd read. I would recommend this class to people who already enjoy literature and writing, but also to people who just need a writing or humanities credit. I think anyone would enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who feel that the Near East and its cultural emissions represent a blind spot in their education so far. None of the work is tedious and all the literature I found fascinating. On the other hand, because we kept on changing the syllabus, we couldn't spend too much time on any one work, so I would suggest taking a more specific course if you already know a fair amount about the Near East. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Though this course is new, Professor Slanski's academic focus bode well with the course she's teaching, allowing her to provide deep insight that cannot be gleaned from elsewhere. She successfully encouraged meaningful discussion. She managed to strike a good balance between letting students discuss their own thoughts and injecting her own questions to guide the conversation. This course was a non-intimidating introduction to a subject I had no previous experience with, and she made sure all students were comfortable with the pace of the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: it was a low-stress, high-reward class that introduced me to many works of literature that I'm extremely grateful to have had to opportunity to discuss in such an inclusive, student-led academic setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is a great writing credit because Professor Slanski assigns a variety of types of writing, and many have creative or unconventional options. The weekly reading responses are very manageable and convenient, and allowed us to only write 2 papers for a grade, one of which was not an analytical essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Near Eastern literature is fascinating, and there aren't that many courses that give you a solid introduction to it. You will leave this class wanting to read more! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it provides an alternative look at literature and a writing course. Rather than focusing on writing a large number of papers, it encourages friendly communication among peers. "
