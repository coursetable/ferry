            "\u00a0The strength of the courses is the blend of classic texts with contemporary scholarship. The timing of the class enabled discussion of the Midterm elections and its results using previously discussed course concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I think the one thing that could be improved would be requiring a research paper rather than a literature review for graduate students -- I feel that would help us develop our skills in not just understanding, but contributing to the body of work on American elections . \r\n\r\nThe stregnths were a clear course syllabus which clearly surveyed major theories and phenomena in American elections, and Professor Mayhew's incredible depth of knowledge on the subject.
