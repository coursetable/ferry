            "\u00a0I learned that I need to spend more time on my essays, but also that I have some skills in writing essays quickly and under pressure (and I also learned that this is not reason to wait until the last minute to start). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze literature and incorporate them into my writing. I also learned how to structure essays better and articulate sentences to improve my argument. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills developed a lot during this course. I learned that I should be very particular with my words and should not try to over-embellish my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to support my thesis more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write academic papers, a skill that I feel is crucial as a university student. I also learned how to write research papers and construct original claims. ",
            "\u00a0How to write at a basic college level ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a thesis based argument and support my claim through various types of research and counterarguments. ",
            "\u00a0It's difficult to parcel out individual skills gained but overall I feel like a much more confident writer. I've learned to pay attention to sentence and paragraph structure and also to logically sequence and connect my ideas. Great attention was paid to formation of an effective claim and also sub-claims and a general motive for my argument. \r\nIt was extremely insightful to participate in class discussions related to the topic of the course. Conversation topics ranged from feminist theory to silent protests and all enabled us to learn from each other's perspectives. Perhaps most useful for me was that arguing in class helped me to find my voice which I would then use to communicate my ideas in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to formulate an original claim, something that seems self-explanatory but was rather difficult for me when I first began this course. I am now able to read seemingly incomprehensibly complex texts and analyze them for their deeper meanings. I feel that I have greatly improved and progressed as a writer over this semester. Ive also learned a lot more about resistance movements and about notable rebels and the theory that accompanies them. "

            "\u00a0strengths: engaging class discussions, interesting readings, reasonable timelines for essays, welcoming environment\r\nweaknesses: I didn't like reading the books that we bought or the information on style/clarity ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the meetings to improve the rough draft before the final draft is due. Also, discussing the readings in depth helps students form ideas for  arguments. The weaknesses of this course include the time consumption that it takes to perfect an essay and still having to read and analyze readings multiple times a week. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the ability to open up discussion about relevant topics in modern society. \r\nA weakness was that it was difficult to engage with some texts, but overall I enjoyed the essay toward the end in which we had much more freedom choosing which readings and sources we wanted to use. ",
            "\u00a0Less readings and more editing papers to help us see what needed to be worked on. ",
            "\u00a0The class did a good job of providing feedback and learning how to improve my writing, but I think the schedule was overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 114 is a well-organized and effective introductory writing course. Students receive plenty of feedback on their writing, learn the basic foundations of strong college writing, and get to engage with their fellow students in discussion/peer conference settings. ",
            "\u00a0The texts being read are strengths. They challenge students to closely read and expand their thoughts. I personally loved reading Zizek and Albert Camus. I believe they are perfect for this class. I didn't really find any weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it has a very broad scope of material which means that there is literally something for everybody to talk about in class. Also, this allows us to learn about and become familiar with a wide range of important topics. \r\nAnother strength is that the course is well scheduled in that manageable timelines are set up for drafts and final submissions. This allowed us to manage our work output effectively. \r\nPerhaps one major weakness is that texts are not exploited as effectively as possible. Rather than analysing each text for elements like style, structure and method, it feels like we solely focus on content and meaning. This is not to say that content is unimportant (rather, the contrary) but there is much more practical value to the texts that we do not utilise. This could perhaps be looked at in curriculum planning. ",
            "\u00a0Im having trouble thinking of a weakness for the course. It wouldve helped if we were perhaps supplied with sample papers to serve as models for our writing. Even still, I feel as though the structure of the class allowed us to ask for help if we needed it but for the most part we were able to advance without being spoon fed, so to speak. I thought the writing center also helped greatly. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who has similar interests to me because I found all of the readings and class discussions meaningful and stimulating. I also learned a lot about how I can improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in enhancing their writing skills and learning how to properly argue their side of something while incorporating other works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would because I found it to improve my writing and be interesting enough for me to want to keep reading about similar topics. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would. If a student is looking to learn how to formulate claims and write these driven papers, this class will challenge them and expand your views about the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course for students who want to develop their academic writing skills and are willing to commit to the work load. However, it is my understanding that there may be other courses that would place students at a more advanced level in their writing and also that the workload commitment may not be commensurate to benefits. Nonetheless I am happy that I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course topic was fascinating to me, and I learned a lot about the history of rebellion.  I wasnt anticipating that we would examine the theoretical side of it, but Im so glad that we did. I didnt originally intended take this course, and I was placed into it last minute. It grew to become my favorite class this semester. I improved greatly as a writer and I further developed my analytical skills. The class isnt too much work, but it definitely isnt a gut. "
