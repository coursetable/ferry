            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting material. Lectures are always clear and informative. Modeling in MATlab is also extremely helpful for mastering concepts.\r\nWeakness: Problem set questions were sometimes a little vague and needed clarification. Would love to have done more advanced modeling and simulations as well. "

            "\u00a0100% to anyone interested in biology. It is great to not only know what happens in biological mechanisms but to also know the mathematics needed to model the biological phenomenon. This class teaches you just that. Previous biological classes will teach about stuff like gene regulation with activators and repressors, but this class teaches you how that stuff works on a mechanistic level. Things like the MAPK signaling cascade are not just explained using \"hand-wavy\" justifications for why the signal gets amplified. Instead, you learn how to model it and watch it happen firsthand. Even people with a more physics/engineering background are sure to enjoy this class. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone. "
