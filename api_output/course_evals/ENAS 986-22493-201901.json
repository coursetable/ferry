For anyone who is conducting research into semiconductors or using nanofabrication techniques in their research, this course offers an excellent survey of device physics and the principles of semiconductor device fabrication. The course does not dwell on lengthy derivations, but rather seeks to explain how the physics can be applied to engineering functional and practical semiconductor devices. ",
