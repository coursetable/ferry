            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the current state of American education and the underlying causes for many of the issues in our K-12 and higher education systems. I also became much more comfortable with writing and with asserting strong opinions in my writing. I've also learned a bit about what makes good teaching and a good learning environment, and now have harsher opinions of some of my other Yale classes that don't use those methods. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from debates in education policy, I learned how to write more clearly and concisely. I also got a lot better at writing more quickly, perhaps as a result of being more confident in my ability to write. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly essays were a difficult and intensive exercise, but definitely forced me to rethink how I planned my time over the course of the semester. In return for the heavy writing, Professor Hersh gives fantastic feedback.  I also worked on my ability to integrate quantitative and qualitative sources of information - normally I ignore the graphs, charts, and numbers when reading sociology texts (yikes, I know), but I found that that was much harder to do with some of the education literature we were reading. \r\n\r\nI took this seminar as a sophomore, and I feel like it was exactly what I needed at this point in my college career. I gained a fairly comprehensive survey-level knowledge of the landscape of K12 public education. But the real gem of the course, at least for me, was in the latter half when we began to explore theories of learning and development and the purpose/theory/practice/history of American higher education. My final paper for the course ended up being a 20+ page synthesis of what education literature says makes for a truly transformative college experience, written in the form of a guide to Yale College students. As much as I wanted it to be a resource for other students, I gained a lot from thinking critically, creatively, and expansively about what it was, exactly, that I wanted to get out of my Yale experience an the kinds of decisions that I would have to make (with intention!) in order to make that happen. I'm excited to follow my own advice and turn what I've learned in this course into praxis (theory in actual practice). ",
            "\u00a0This course is *the* survey course to take on education in the American context. I cannot speak highly enough of how comprehensively put together the readings are, how well each week's topic flows into the next, and how much I feel I've improved as a writer and a student learning from Prof. Hersh. This course will challenge you in a way you likely haven't been before, and you will learn to write according to his rigorous standards; coherently, concisely, and cogently (Prof. Hersh's 3 C's of writing). It's not easy but it's sooooo rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of the various worlds of early education, K-12 education, higher education, and various associated education reforms. In terms of my writing, I learned the importance of being concise, cohesive, and writing in a generative manner rather than a strictly critical one (which is extremely important, particularly in collegiate-level writing). I learned how to collaboratively write two papers (or at least had practice doing that). ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a comprehensive overview of the American education system. We learned about interesting topics from preschool to college such as the achievement gap, early childhood development, liberal education. I gained a very solid knowledge base that has allowed me to better understand my own educational journey and what I want out of it. Lastly, MY WRITING IMPROVED GREATLY. I did not see it at first, even when I started to get better grades on the weekly papers, but no doubt this class helped me become a better writer. I am much more self-aware and getting into the practice of writing something every week has helped me become more efficient in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Grew immensely as a writer. I learned how to synthesize evidence from sources to support an argument of my own. I learned how to draft and re-draft to make a coherent argument. I learned how to avoid abstraction and express my views through concrete examples. ",
            "\u00a0The most significant thing I gained from this class was writing skills, by having weekly assignments that were harshly graded and revisable. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: we covered a lot of material, but in sufficient depth to not feel like a broad survey course and to feel like we were really engaging with the material. Prof. Hersh obviously knew a lot about the developmental/neuroscience basis of what truly helps students learn, and applied these principles to the class, which was a welcome change from some of my other classes this semester. The weekly essay assignments were difficult at first, but over the semester I consciously felt myself get so much more comfortable with them and I know this course really helped me feel more at ease with writing and with articulating strong opinions. Which I'm sure Prof. Hersh knows bc he predicted that would happen with everyone by the end of the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks' readings and writing assignments felt a little repetitive (though this did help us internalize that material more and sometimes contributed to greater depth of discussion). Sometimes seminar felt a little more like Prof. Hersh lecturing for a good amount of the time, but that was always interesting too -- overall this was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course. writing a weekly paper and getting feedback was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of a single weakness of this course. The weekly papers are tough (he asks for 2-3 pages, which sounds easy, I know, until you get the first one back and see how Hersh has absolutely torn apart your writing). As he tells students in the first class, it will be a challenge to sufficiently answer the weekly prompts in two pages. He has 0 tolerance for fluff writing, equivocal language, tangential points or weak argument. It's trial by fire, but it is so entirely worth it. You *will* leave this course a stronger writer and clearer thinker. ",
            "\u00a0The constant writing requirement of the course is extremely helpful, and I appreciated the structure, regimen, and practice associated. It was so interesting to read other students' thoughts. I appreciated seminar, though I think it could have been used more productively. Prof Hersh is a terrific teacher, thinker, and speaker, but I would have loved to see more on his end to encourage and facilitate debate/discussion among students (which did happen sometimes). The course really makes you consider what you believe about higher education and consider many societal factors that may play in. It's a lot of reading, but all fairly interesting and mostly updated. ",
            "\u00a0This course has been such a formative experience for me that I don't even know where to begin. The weekly writing assignments are definitely a strength. They get you into the habit of writing frequently, and that goes a really long way for helping you become a better writer. Further, the writing assignments are very different from what you'd expect. Many of them encourage self-reflection or more vested thinking on the subject at hand, so don't see them as your usual reading response paper summaries. Others even ask you to write with other people, which was such an interesting learning experience. Most of the readings were also extremely interesting, especially for someone who knew nothing at all about the main issues in education before taking this class. Lastly, Professor Hersh is incredible. He truly cares about his students and makes every effort to make himself available to you. I would leave class frequently mind-blown at the insights he'd just imparted.\r\n\r\nI think some of the reading selection can be improved. While most of them were great or at the very least necessary to grasp a particular issue, others had outdated data despite there being more recent data. For example, while it makes sense to read Hirsch to learn about the concept of cultural literacy despite the age of the text, \"The Near-Myth of Our Failing Schools\" definitely has more updated versions that benefit from updated data.\r\n\r\nOn a side note: Professor Hersh grades incredibly fast. You will have your paper less than 24 hours after you turned it in, which is nice for actually incorporating feedback. ",
            "\u00a0High expectations and weekly feedback were the cornerstone of my learning in the class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! One of the best courses I've taken so far, and the first time in the last couple semesters that I've felt like I actually got what I wanted and expected from a class. You come away having understood so much material about our education system, and much better able to articulate your own ideas about it. This class is also a semester of real mentorship from Prof. Hersh in terms of helping each student improve their writing and gain comfort with writing. This course finally showed me how a course should be structured in order to actually help students learn. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to any student interested in improving their writing and in education policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Wholeheartedly yes, especially for sophomores. Don't let the \"preference for EDST students/permission of instructor required\" notices scare you away. This course has changed the way that I think about what education should (and must) be. ",
            "\u00a0You will have done yourself a disservice if you graduate from Yale not having taken a course with Dick Hersh. Take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would, especially if you'd like to improve your writing, have practice writing, and have an interest in education. For this class, the more work and commitment you put into the class, the more you will get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I wholeheartedly recommend this course! While it may seem daunting due to the weekly assignments, you quickly get used to it, and they will help improve your writing in a way that a less involved course never could. However, TAKE IT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PUT IN THE TIME. Professor Hersh provides ample opportunity for rewriting assignments that didn't go so well. Take advantage of this! You only get good at writing if you practice AND make it a regular habit to edit (aka scrap and completely rewrite) your papers after receiving feedback. One of my biggest regrets this semester was taking this class along with several other very involved classes, preventing me from fully investing myself. This class is worth making the time for, and I assure you that everyone can benefit from having such a formative experience. You will not only learn about education but about yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Without reservation. You will grow immensely as a writer, and, by extension, as a thinker. You will learn how to express yourself with greater clarity and precision. You will learn how to make coherent arguments and to synthesize readings, which is an essential skill to learn ASAP. You will have a much better time in your other classes because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- this course gave me a lot of opportunity to think through my own education, from elementary school through college, and really improved my writing skills. "
