It gives a much clearer understanding of estimation methods (ML, GMM) and, at least for me, it connected several concepts that were sort of divided in my head. ",

            "\u00a0The weakness is definitely the very basic level of the course material. I wish the instructor would have used his time to present and prove deeper and more complex results. The required homework take a lot of time to finish while providing no insights or learning experience at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - most of material covered is interesting - course is challenging and rigorous, definitely made me smarter\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Took up so much time compared to other courses - was difficult to keep up, material was covered at such a fast pace, that it was hard to understand and process it. I think it could benefit from eliminating some of the lectures - sigma fields, and lebesgue measure, and a few others, and covering the remaining topics more thoroughly and in better depth. Exams were so difficult - I don't understand the philosophy of giving an exam that you expect most students not to be able to answer half the questions. Then it becomes more of a test of what they already know from other courses rather than what they've learned in this course. Also many of the lectures were dull and hard to follow. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: it is very deep and is very well structured. \r\nI think it can be improved by showing in which situations all the material is going to be useful in research. Sometimes it gets too abstract and we lose perspective of what is the importance of these topics. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were mostly adequate in length and difficulty. However, towards the end of the semester, one or two problems per homework were too difficult for me. \r\n\r\nThe final was difficult but reasonable. The midterm was unreasonably long for the allotted time. ",
            "\u00a0The class notes are very detailed and extremely helpful. Everything you could ever need is in the class notes, and they are straightforward and therefore easy to understand (as easy as this complicated math could ever be). \r\n\r\nThe weakness I found is that sometimes I found myself not understanding why we were studying certain things, or the connection between the different topics being studied, which made the class a bit harder to follow. I'm also not sure how helpful many of the concepts are to PhD students who are not interested in econometric theory. ",
            "\u00a0Well structured, engaging ",
            "\u00a0The volume of concepts and the corresponding pace at times felt overwhelming. I found the lecture notes to be very good. However, I did not feel I learned much from listening to lectures, and I think it would be more helpful if the actual lectures were more differentiated from the notes. For example, the lectures could be more focused on the hardest parts of the lecture, while the notes provide a comprehensive look at the lecture as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I like how the topics are covered and how the course builds upon itself. The Lecture Notes are amazing. \r\n\r\nI do not know if there is a particular reason, but the only thing is that it would have been more natural for me that, after OLS, we would cover point estimation, interval estimation and finish with hypothesis testing. The latter topics are very closely related so I believe that would make the transition smoother. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: high quality of the problem sets, lecture notes, and the course efficiency to deliver its main takeaway: a rigorous formalization of microeconomics' foundations.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I believe the lectures can be more didactic, interactive and focus more on intuitions related to the topics of the course. The remaining details (which are on the lecture notes and on the textbook) will necessaraly be covered by students at home when they are doing the problem sets - and may not overload the amount of information given in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Andrews provides a fantastic set of notes and the course assignments allowed students to work through representative problems. \r\n\r\nWhile I found it difficult to follow along in class, I think that was more the result of my unfamiliarity with the material than through any fault of Dr. Andrews. I do think that the TA session might be more helpful if it were used to provide more of a summary of the week's lectures and focused less on covering new material. I did really appreciate the time in the TA session spent going over past exam questions and strategies for solving frequent questions included on exams. "
