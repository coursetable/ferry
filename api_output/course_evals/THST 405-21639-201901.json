            "\u00a0Emotional Vulnerability, How to unlearn societal norms to discover new opportunities in storytelling, how to laugh again, in an odd sense--freedom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself and how I approach new and challenging situations. I also learned about comedy. ",
            "\u00a0I have reconnected with my sense of childhood and play. I have the ability to be more generous, open, spontaneous, and vulnerable. ",
            "\u00a0I developed insight into how to articulate emotion and action through physicality, I learned how to let go of physical habits and freely express through the body. I learned about the connection between the mind and body, I learned about the technique of clowning and the basics of commedia dell'arte. ",
            "\u00a0Advanced knowledge of physical comedy and clown technique. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an exercise in un-learning; un-learning the need to find a \"point\" when starting a performance or experiment or just having fun. The class definitely helped me to prioritize truth and spontaneity in my theater and comedy, rather than finding a \"point\" or \"fixing\" it in advance. ",
            "\u00a0How to look for yummy treats and shiny things ",
            "\u00a0Great intro to the art of clowning. Practicing trusting our instincts, not thinking too much, finding our inner child, finding our inner clown. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is an awesome opportunity to learn from an incredibly skilled artist and teacher. It is rare that undergrads get such a studio-based, practical opportunity like this, and Chris is undoubtedly one of the best to learn from. He creates such a comforting, welcoming, and open space in which everyone can be vulnerable, embrace failure, and take risks. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Chris Bayes, Length of classes, so that everyone who wants to perform each week is typically able to. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This is more of a scheduling issue, but because of the class only meeting once a week, there are often difficulties with people getting into the class off the wait-list if someone drops after shopping period. ",
            "\u00a0Great course all around. Chris is great. More feedback on how we're doing in the class would be really helpful. You don't get any sort of progress report, so it is impossible to know how well you're doing (and I've heard the class is graded pretty harshly). ",
            "\u00a0This class is unlike anything else at Yale college. Chris Bayes is a master teacher. The one thing that was tough was how tiring the class was on the voice and body. I found myself hoarse after class. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. It was challenging for me, as the content that I learned was very new and outside of my comfort zone, however I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe that the pressure that came with my lack of comfort with the material forced me to push myself to go further with the work. A strength of this class was the element of surprise, it was helpful that each day we walked into class, we didn't know what was coming because it forced the students to remain open, loose and ready to do anything as opposed to preparing for the exercises. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful in that there is no written homework, but you have to really think about it (and will want to think about it) often if you're going to do well and internalize its teachings. The only potential weakness is that it is potentially very scary, vulnerable work at first, and some people get scared and drop the class because of this. However, I suppose that is really just their loss. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly involving and engaging from the first day. It asks much of students, but justifiably. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very enjoyable and you get to know all the other students and see them develop and grow over the semester. My one critique is that Prof Bayes sometimes made uncomfortable comments to the class about students' disabilities or generalizations about ethnicities, which undermined the \"safe space to do dangerous things\" he said he was creating in the classroom. I wasn't always sure where the course was headed, which was a strength rather than a weakness and I learned to lean in to the exercises and let go of expectations when entering the classroom, which I think is pretty central to clowning and physical comedy. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we'd gotten more individualized work time, but I think that was a function of how large the class was. ",
            "\u00a0Hard to practice what learned outside of class -- a lot of his suggestions were to enroll in his summer classes lol. But it was a really cool experience to get close (in a weird way) to a group of other students in just a semester. Nothing like stage fright and embarrassment to bring people together. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you consider yourself a performer or are interested in comedy or even have no exposure to either, the tools you gain from this class teach you a lot about yourself and how to embrace an aspect of your personality that we work very hard to repress in our daily lives. ",
            "\u00a0My advice changes depending on the person. IF you are the kind of person who is terrified of public performance, and you do not wish to change this fact about yourself, I do not believe this will be the most comfortable course for you. I think you should still take the course if you are offered the chance, but know that it will be an emotional journey. This is a course that allows for and demands emotional release from the students in their performance.If you are seriously aspiring to become and actor, then I highly recommend this course if you get in(Theater Studies majors get preference). If you are not interested in acting as a career but you are interested in becoming more emotionally available and vulnerable and becoming a better person, then you should still definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was so fun. It was great to have a break for traditional coursework and learn more about myself through this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great break from the normal push and grind that is Yale.  Chris does a fantastic job of fostering tight relationships between classmates.  In class can be challenging for some, but it will help develop one as an actor.  The major bonus, there is no homework in the typical sense.  This class reduced my stress level significantly.  Warning for sensitive students:  HE WILL CHALLENGE YOUR COMFORT ZONE.  This was a major problem for some students in enjoying the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class with free you from the stress of Yale for 3 hours a week and teaches you essential skills for acting and life. ",
            "\u00a0Take this ! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone at Yale, whether they are interested in theater of not. Not only is it a great class to learn about actual techniques for actors, it is a class that facilitates learning about the self and about people as a whole, it allowed me to see myself and the world in a new way. This class is special and unlike any other at Yale; while there is very little homework and it is not intellectually rigorous, it is emotionally and physically challenging and pushes the class members to confront a different kind of learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to pretty much everyone. Incredible experience and you will be profoundly challenged and changed in countless ways. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student-- in theater or not in theater. It is organized to be accessible to anyone willing to commit to it, and by the end I felt like we had all gained so much: how to live more fully in our bodies, in our interactions, our confidence, and our emotions.  It requires that you be vulnerable and open to 'failing' in front of your peers, but at the end of the day this was so helpful to allow us to embrace 'failure' and learn the rewards of taking risks and pushing the boundaries of rules we've been taught to internalize. Once it became less scary it was just so fun, and I feel so much more in-tune with myself and what it means to 'succeed' as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the student. The course is like probably no other offered at Yale, and represents a unique opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fun class to take in your senior year if you're not a Theater Studies major--it's three hours a week, no homework, no exams, and lot of fun when you're in class. It can sometimes be unclear how to improve in the clowning endeavors since the expectations are super changeable, but it's worth it if you have an extra spot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class (if you can get in). The levels of theatrical training in the room varies a lot, so anyone can take this class, and actually having people who feel like they know what they're doing and others who approach the practice with more humility and/or less experience allows the class to get at both some nuances and the fundamentals of clowning. It is an enjoyable class and pretty tiring. I found that the class made me more flexible and silly in day to day life, as a core tenant of the class is letting go of the need for a purpose more generally. ",
            "\u00a0YES. THIS CLASS IS INCREDIBLE. TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! There were hardly any truly uncomfortable moments (when someone went a little too far); almost always was the good type of uncomfortable that leads to growth. Super fun way to spend 3 hours every Monday. And no other assignments. Seriously. You get to play around and be goofy and stupid and make people laugh, while learning about yourself and learning better what you can do when onstage. What could be better? "
