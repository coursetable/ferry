            "\u00a0I rarely write a lot for these,  but I feel I have some form of civic duty to warn future students of this class. I was told this class enjoyable and interesting, especially for S&DS majors, but wow were those people wrong. I have never before been in a class where I genuinely do not think I learned a single thing. Professor Wu may do interesting research or something for Yale, but he should absolutely not be teaching intro probability. Quite frankly, I'm at a loss of how to even begin to describe how poor this class was. I think a good sign is that by the third week, maybe 25 students showed up to lectures because they were so unhelpful (this class was slated to be in Davies Aud, one of the largest halls on campus!). The slides were exclusively in set notation, which Professor Yu didn't even bother to explain at the begging of the course...this is a intro class, set notation is something people have not seen extensively. Further, the slides are basically a series of proofs with no context and very few practice problems to demonstrate concepts in an understandable, so for all intents and purposes the slides were completely useless. Lectures involve Professor Wu standing at the chalkboard with his back to the lecture hall, talking quietly, and writing proofs on the board. You could only hear him if you sat in the front few rows (which, to be fair, wasn't to hard considering no one ever was at class). I am thinking about majoring in S&DS but this class is making me reconsider that. We've gotten several articles from Yale this year about how they're putting tons of resources into the S&DS department, and if this is true I am shocked how this class could be so unbelievably poorly run. I had to teach myself everything in this class through watching Harvard and MIT lectures on YouTube. Additionally, we were given no feedback on problem sets and they were graded incredibly erratically. You would get one back and there'd be a couple answers circled with \"-5\" or something written on the page and you'd have not idea what went wrong since someone with the same answer got full credit for the problem.  I feel incredibly let down by the school. I could go on about this for far longer, but I'm on break and thinking more about this class is the last thing I want to do. ",

            "\u00a0This course had the potential to properly teach extremely relevant, applicable, and interesting topics in probability theory; however, it utterly failed to accomplish this mission. Lecture slides were filled with abstract calculus and algebra that was presented without justification, relevant theorems and their corollaries were rarely stated and not emphasized, and no strategy for problem solving was ever taught. Professor Wu demonstrated a clear disregard for student comprehension of the material, instead he was content with lecturing non-stop for 75 minutes, rapidly clicking through slides, disregarding crucial steps as \"simple calculus,\" and pretending as if he had taught the material. The only skills to be developed by taking this course is self-study and bravery, for problem sets rarely covered topics that the average student could answer alone or in study groups. The midterm was surprisingly easy but the final was excruciatingly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot but let me tell you that was all on me. This was the worst freaking class I have taken of all time with the worst professor. Please avoid all Yihong Wu classes. The material is interesting and not too complex, but you teach 97% of it to yourself. Most of my friends watched lectures on youtube of the Harvard version of this class because our lectures were so miserable and useless and saddening (except for the one time we had a guest lecturer). Office hours do not help. Section does not help. The professor is garbage, the TAs are garbage. I went into the final with a great grade so let me tell you this isn't even me being resentful. This is just a poorly taught class and you should avoid unless set on being an SDS major. Lecture is mostly slides of proofs that are useless when it comes to psets and tests: if i were to show you the psets/tests/lectures from this class separately you would be like: oh, these must be from three different classes! But no. This class in one word: emasculating. I gained the insight that I have good work ethic and am good at teaching myself things, that is all. ",

This course could have gone more slowly and in more detail. In many lectures we were running to cover as much as possible. It would have been better if we had discussed the concepts in depth in class. Some of the concepts that are related to mathematical analysis were not covered, but I think that is normal for the class, because it focuses on statistical notions, not analysis. The class could have gone more slowly. The book was good. It did not treat the mathematical aspects of the notions very much, however, the class itself did not seem very focused on the mathematical explanation of the notions. ",

But the lectures are extremely hard to follow and do not include enough example problems that help you tackle homework problems/exams. Lecture is not an effective way to teach math classes, they should be taught in small classes where students work together and actively learn/solve problems during class. But that's not going to happen anytime soon so this class is sort of doing it's best. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures for this class are all very clear and are posted online, which is helpful when studying for exams. The problem sets are usually much harder than the exams, although that is probably a good thing in terms of preparation. Some of the topics felt a bit detached from the rest, but those were the exception; otherwise, the class flowed well. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always taught very well and covered interesting material. They always began with a review of the previous lecture, which I appreciated. However, the problem sets were extremely difficult, so most students ended up scrambling to go to office hours or ask their peers in order to get the solutions in time for the deadline. At least there were office hours almost every weekday. Additionally, the exams were very difficult and most people struggled with them. ",

The examples he did during class lecture (most during the first half of the semester) were also really useful, but he stopped doing examples toward the end of the semester which left a lot of concepts fairly confusing. There was also not that much preparation available for the midterm or final exams, as office hours were generally limited and he did not post answer keys for the practice final exams :( ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength is that this course is structured well, with weekly psets that are always roughly the same length.  Unfortunately, everything else about this course was pretty bad.  Yihong is not a good lecturer, especially at 9AM, and his exams were brutal (the final average last time he taught this course was under 70).  I have no idea what my grade in this course will be. ",

Problem sets were too short for the difficulty of the material, and the first half of the course was much easier than the second half of the course. There are a wide range of students in the class, so class time is wasted by elementary questions while Professor Wu rushes through some of the more complicated mathematical concepts in the class. It could be improved by lengthening problem sets. The problem sets themselves varied widely in difficulty. ",

Difficult content is expected, but in the presented format the final exam was near impossible. ",
            "\u00a0Class was fair as were the midterms and homework, but the final exam was absurdly difficult to a degree I had never experienced before, as we were presented questions in manners we never learned to tackle in neither the notes nor the homework. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, organized lecture notes, problem sets were very helpful for the exams. Weaknesses: The concepts could have been explained more conceptually before diving straight into the proofs. I thought Yihong rushed through some important concepts (like transformations between different random variables, moment generating functions, CLT, etc.) so it would be beneficial to spend more time on these. Also, the final exam was much harder and longer than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Go deeper, don't learn the CLT and MGFs on the last two lectures of class, learn how to apply them better as they are the heavy-hitters of the class. Write a clear and easy to interpret final, as the questions were poorly written and vague. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be made smaller and fewer material should be covered. Lectures should focus on more concrete examples rather than proofs as the class is not a proof-based class. Psets are extremely time-consuming and difficult, tying together all material covered before the student has even had a chance to properly learn the material. The structure of huge lectures and psets, 1 midterm and 1 final is a terrible way of promoting student learning. Students stress over psets and that only distracts the students from actually learning the material. Only 1 midterm assessing an entire half-semester's worth of material is not good either. ",
            "\u00a0ULAs saved this course. They held office hours which were mostly used to work through problem sets, but they were very helpful in explaining how to think about a problem and answering questions along the way (perhaps because they have though about such problems recently, and can relate to our confusion). Yihong's slides are fantastic, but his teaching was challenging to follow. His problem sets are also fairly difficult, as was the midterm (if you haven't seen competition math and classic probability problems before) and final. ",

At least the slides (which were gorgeous and informative, by the way) were always posted. Another weakness is that I don't think any final exam should ever be that hard! I got the impression that I wasn't the only one who had huge struggles with it, so unless the averages prove me wrong, I do think that it needed to be better calibrated to the time allotted and our level of understanding. A strength was that Prof Wu was very clear in lecture and his slides, again, were beautiful and accessible, and he did make an effort to explain the significance of the concepts he was teaching. Another strength was that the TA and ULA office hours were super helpful. The problem sets could be very difficult but I knew that they were achievable if I went to office hours-- and with a bit (or maybe a lot) of help they were actually satisfying and helped me learn the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: The difficulty of the exams and some problem sets discourage people from being able to grasp the concepts of probability. There was also sometimes a lack of communication between the students and the professor, ULAs and TFs. ",
            "\u00a0Yihong was a great lecturer (for those who managed to make the 9am wakeup) and his slides covering the material were SO incredibly helpful. The tests were very difficult (much harder than problem sets) and I hear that the average on the 2016 Final Exam was a 42%. Not sure why he makes them so hard (if I were a freshman and this were my first math class at Yale, that would be an awakening and a half). The class problem sets were very helpful and the textbook was a great supplement to lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were not engaging and Yihong Wu feels like a robot. Final exam was the hardest math test I've taken in my entire life, and I think was unfair and other students felt the same. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is very interesting, but Professor Wu struggled to communicate it. I stopped going to lecture 2/3rds of the way through the course, using the slides as a resource. These slides were okay, but could have more effort put into. Alternatively, in another math course of mine the professor posts a couple pages of concisely-written notes on the topic. This would have been much clearer for 241. ",
            "\u00a0More guidance on homework ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were well written, weren't a horrible time commitment, but still solidified the skills every week.  I didn't think the lecture was super helpful.  I skipped a few times because of late nights and other homework but I didn't feel that behind.  The powerpoints from lecture on canvas were helpful, especially while reviewing for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the slides are very well organized, the psets are pretty fun and fair, very fair midterm, lots of practice midterms/finals available to study, TAs are helpful during office hours\r\nweaknesses: Moves way, way too fast during the second half. Continuous probability distributions are a lot to deal with harder than discrete probability distributions, but we moved maybe twice as fast when studying continuous probability. The course might benefit from moving less slowly at the beginning and using the additional time to slow down when covering concepts such as the CLT, joint distributions, etc. The final was also really hard. Mean squared error is very annoying to compute. Also, why didn't the practice final have solutions? ",
            "\u00a0The professor of this course clearly did not care about the learning of his students. He rushed very quickly through his poor lectures and refused to slow down even when asked by numerous students to do so. Whenever a question was asked, rather than providing an answer he made it his job to make you feel stupid by letting you know that he believed the question you asked was dumb. He was not helpful and did not teach. There are no strengths about this course whatsoever. This class is a disgrace to the classes at Yale and is a disgrace to the Yale education. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Probability is interesting, so any probability class is fun to study. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The topic is not easy, especially for those who are new to Math classes beyond Calculus and Linear Algebra. Lecture slides are not enough to fully understand the topic. You should put great effort trying to understand the topics by reading the book or searching summaries online. While attending lectures help to certain degree, they are not enough, even to understand 60% of the material presented in the given lecture. To address this issue, the Professor could put extra effort into offering books and online materials to study. The professor holds 2 hours of office hours every week, and there are some TA office hours. But not all TAs are good at teaching. In fact, it was noted that some TAs were not fluent in English and had hard time clearly explaining the topics. This leaves only a handful of office hours where you can learn the topic well. 2 hours with the Professor certainly helps, but in a class of 150+ students, it is not at all sufficient. In summary, the class did not have enough outside of lecture support, and as a student, I felt alone in my journey to understand Probability Theory properly. While I have been very passionate about the topic, I would have enjoyed my experience much more with proper care given by the Professors and instructors. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was very interesting, but that the lectures were not engaging. Lecture notes were detailed and very helpful, so it was much easier to review lecture notes independently rather than go to class, where the instructor would reiterate lecture notes. I thought the problem sets reflected what we learned in class, and that the course was very well organized. ",

All of the topics were somehow unrelated through his teaching. I saw no connections between any of the topics. He liked to jump around. His teaching style is fast and inconsiderate. His responses make you feel like an absolute dumbass. By the end of the semester, I was too scared to ask him questions because he would literally make me feel like a dumbass. Homework topics also jumped around and often would not be relevant to what we learned in class. It would be helpful to make the homeworks categorized by week so that students even knew what they were practicing. ",

He seemed as if he did not want to receive any questions. Half of the answers to my questions ended as \"But is obvious. It is clearly stated in the slides.\" when of course it was not. \r\n-It was a good thing that the home works took up such a large percentage of the grade, since the final exam was a creation of the devil. \r\n-The final exam had almost no connection what so ever with what we did during the rest of the semester. No matter how many exercised I would solve, I would never had been ready for the final. The Professor was out of his mind. What exactly was the point of having such an impossible exam? It had no learning value and it only made us feel bad for our selves. The Professor should never be allowed in the history of time and existence to create an other exam. This single exam may have destroyed my entire GPA. I was so confident for this class. I had aced all of the home works and I had done great in the midterm. But no. All this effort had to be thrown out of the window with this horrendous exam. Such an exam is probably the reason that so many Yalies every year fall into depression or much worst decide to end their lives because they cannot meet the unrealistic expectations that this society has made us live up to. I hope to God that I never have to see any of the people who designed this exam in front of my eyes. Shame on you. ",

In terms of weaknesses, I think sometimes Professor Wu's explanations weren't the clearest and that the final was unrealistically challenging (it was too long to be completed in the allotted time and had some very confusing portions). Also having more resources for the final would definitely have been incredibly helpful (i.e. extra review sessions, posted solutions to practice finals, and so on). ",

He hates his students, doesnt help during office hours, is demoralizing, and only cares about his research.  Ive come to expect such amazing teachers at Yale, and this was a huge disappointment.  He can also barely speak English, and is partial to the Chinese students.  He didnt give us answers to the practice finals but gave the answers to the Chinese students. ",

Office hours were feeding frenzies, with dozens of kids crammed into the little stats building basement clamoring for help while the prof and TFs, who are literal career statisticians, assured us that the work was actually quite easy and we should just think back to high school calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I thought that the lecture slides and the discussion sections were very helpful. The main weakness of the course was that it is such a large lecture and classroom that it doesn't create the more intimate learning environment like other classes do. ",

We maybe spent too much time explaining the simpler concepts in the beginning and as a result of this we didn't spend enough time going over the more complex ones covered towards the end of the class. I think in the second part of the class the professor was more focused towards covering all of the topics in the syllabus, than towards thoroughly explaining the concepts. ",

It was difficult to justify going to lectures when the professor was just narrating slides that were posted on canvas. The class is definitely hurt by its large size. While you'd think this should mean there are more people to get help from, the class isn't organized for this to occur - so try to take this class with a friend. The biggest weakness of the class was incredibly unclear expectations for what students should be capable of doing. The lectures would involve proofs and at times endless example problems that were totally irrelevant to the psets. The difficulty between the final and midterm (as well as the psets) was striking to a lot of students. While it's okay to have a difficult exam, the students should at least be able to expect what is coming so they can manage their time properly. Additionally, this disorganization at the end of the day has a negative impact on the students education. It was very difficult to focus on learning in this class when the graded work and lectures were organized the way they were. ",

Having this sort of foundation is quite useful  and frankly, essential  for future quantitative work, including data analysis. The course is, on the other hand, too large in size. I did not come to know any of the other students well, nor even the undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs). The homework assignments and midterms paralleled the course material closely, while the final exam blindsided me in terms of the applications it asked of us, and the level of difficulty of the questions. The course material taught varies from year to year, and this is inevitable in any course. I was disappointed we didn't get to Markov chains, an application I was looking forward to. Overall a standard and strong theory course, but with some deficiencies in its basic homework-and-exam structure. More in-depth work, projects, and application-based analysis would enrich the course and provide better preparation for subsequent coursework. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that the class was deeply involved in solving relevant problems and examples. It illustrated daily the utility of probability and reinforced why I wanted to learn the subject. Solving problems and examples is the best way of learning and applying concepts. Problem sets were extremely illustrative and were core to my development in the class. Another major strength of the course was the clarity and thoroughness of Professor Wu in lecture, office hours and his slides. The textbook further reinforced class time and problem sets. It is evident that Professor Wu has an adept knowledge of probability, and his explanations illuminated the deeper mechanistic and intuitive theory driving our solutions. I was very engaged throughout the semester, and I grew tremendously as a problem solver as I built my knowledge and muscle memory. ",

I think a better understanding of the material would be gained by doing problem-set-like questions in class or even doing one question from the problem set each weak. This would also help increase attendance, which was very low. A strength is that everyone is in the class because they want to be, since this isn't like an intro first-year class or a common pre-req.

Now, I know what youre thinking. Youre going to take it anyway. No. Do not do this to yourself. Heres the thing: this class was fine until the final, which counts for 40% of your grade. It was so hard. It was very difficult to prepare for the final; the last time Professor Wu taught the class in fall 2016, the average was a 67; he posted the 2016 final on Canvas but refused to post solutions and instead invited students to come to his office hours to discuss the problems. I went to his office hours and he refused to go into detail about the solutions. This was an extremely stressful situation! Our only point of reference was the fall 2016 final, which was apparently a disaster, and we couldnt even check whether our answers were right. I felt so nervous and unprepared before the test. I have anxiety and I honestly thought I might vomit. The rest of the class was fine. Professor Wu's slides were generally quite good, the book was excellent, and shoutout to the super helpful TFs and ULAs. ",

I never utilized the ULA's, but the TF's seemed to either be clueless at times or totally unaware of how little Prof Wu was actually explaining in lecture. I frankly taught myself 75% of the concepts in this class or watched Harvard lectures that were relevant.

It was a very challenging course that may dissuade my interest in the major, but the material was interesting.

It's definitely not a walk in the park, and it's heavily theoretical with a lot of long calculations with lots of calculus, so I don't think many people would take it as an optional course. However, I do think that I gained a deeper understanding of probability, and the topics do seem foundational for a lot of further study in math, statistics, computer science, engineering, and even any other field that might use statistical methods, like biology/medicine. The 9:00am time slot was brutal, but Prof Wu's slides are amazing and he posts them on Canvas, and the TA and ULA office hours are a lifesaver. I usually spent 5-7 hours on the weekly problem sets, and I did them almost entirely at TA/ULA office hours because they're pretty difficult at first glance. Often after some guidance everything becomes clear, but then there is still a lot of calculus left (definitely brush up on your calculus before this course if you have a chance). It was really satisfying to finish the problem sets, though, and they were helpful for learning the concepts and studying for the exams. The singular midterm (in class) had surprisingly few questions, and while most of them were super manageable, one was very long and convoluted-- unless you'd heard of it (it turns out it was a popular math question) and knew the super easy trick. So that was a little annoying. At least they gave decent partial credit. The final exam was really brutal, though, which was a little unexpected after the easier midterm (but par for the course for Prof Wu based on the fall 2016 final which had a 60% average). I don't know the final exam average yet, but I don't think I was the only one who struggled and didn't even manage to write anything down for some of the questions. ",

Professor Wu would often speed through slides and be visibly frustrated when students would ask relevant questions.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in probability. ",
            "\u00a0No, horribly taught ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE WITH YIHONG.  He is awful, cant teach for his life, and doesnt like his students. ",
            "\u00a0Aaaaahahhaha no. Kids averaged ~60% on the final, theres no support, Yihong tears through new concepts at breakneck speed, and we were all absolutely baffled by the lack of patience every time a question was asked. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it unless you need to. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who need it for their major, or who are very interested in math and probability. This is the type of course that you will thrive in if you are a self-learning in math, i.e. you like reading math textbooks and thinking through the problems, but you probably won't enjoy it if this type of learning doesn't sound fun to you. ",
            "\u00a0No take it with someone else if you can ",
            "\u00a0It depends. If you're a pure math major or are confident in your math skills (AMTH major, S&DS majors) then the course is really easy and a free A. If you keep up with the material in general it's a free A. The issue is that it's really easy to fall behind and then because we're Yale students, we never catch up. The material in the course is also pretty cumulative, so falling behind is pretty devastating. \r\n\r\nIf you don't care about your grade, I would say it's interesting if you care about knowing the theory behind AP Stat material which is really neat.\r\n\r\nAlso, it depends on the professor. Yihong was pretty hard, but I've heard Winston makes the course really easy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone that enjoys this kind of stuff, otherwise you probably won't have too much fun in this course. It is not easy and you will have to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not while it is taught by this professor. ",
            "\u00a0No unless you must take it. I would not ",
            "\u00a0Only take this class if you have to. Even if you are interested in the content, the lectures are boring and the problem sets aren't very organized, i.e. no one was really sure why certain problems were on the psets. The difficulty between the exams was beyond inconsistent and it's really difficult to manage your time with this class. ",
            "\u00a0NO. It is great material but please do not take it with Prof Wu unless you have to. He is far more interested in research than giving time and patience to students. His slides are good, but he seemed to get annoyed by students' questions a lot. There are many smart Profs and he is one of them. His logic was good in class but he often refused to explain details clearly. If  you really want to learn, take this course with another Prof or just go to YouTube to watch Harvard Stats 110. You will learn much more and efficiently that way. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in probability theory or you need it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to any student interested in statistics and data science, or its immediate applications. Take this course only if you require a theoretical basis for the work you're looking to do; it isn't an applications-heavy course. I would not recommend it merely as a shopping course or a course for curiosity; take it if it is a prerequisite, listed or otherwise, for the subsequent work you intend to do. It is an intermediate step, a course that provides a foundational and functional basis. Probability forms a beautiful and elegant theory, in its entirety. This course provides tools, it does not illuminate that beauty. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good introduction to probability to those not exposed to it before, and good review for those who have. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely recommend this course to every student. I think probability is an extremely useful tool. It is challenging and rewarding at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, if taught by Professor Yihong Wu, only if you must take it or if you're taking the class Cr/D/Fail. ",
            "\u00a0I personally regret taking this course. I think most students in it would disagree with me, but I was unsure of the stats major going in and this class just further cemented it in that I am not going to be a stats major. The p-sets are miserable unless you genuinely enjoy and are interested in what they entail, which I was not. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you like math, and it's a good, straightforward intro course. ",
            "\u00a0The level of support given to struggling students was lacking. ",
            "\u00a0I can't say that I would recommend this class to anyone who doesn't absolutely have to take it. "
