Professor Schott gave me the tools to enter any discussion in a dining hall or at a cocktail party about trade and I feel I can now bring a bit of nuance to discussions about trade where you rarely find opinions that are backed up in economics. This course also strengthened my ability to understand economic models and how assumptions drive results. ",

This balance between intuition and trade worked very well. In fact, this course truly succeeds in combining the two while also making the psets and exams challenging. Great course! ",

I now understand why countries trade, why certain countries have benefitted more than others, how a small change in wages or factor endowment would influence trade, etc. I learned how to apply the models I learned to real life scenarios. ",

            "\u00a0I thought it was such an awesome class. I liked how the professor tied in relevant economic research. I didn't feel like the class tied to cover too much or too little - it was just right! ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of strengths, but most notably its structure. It teaches you to tell a story about trade, with each model building off the last. Going into the final exam, I felt like I could tell my roommate a 2-minute history of trade theory, and I'm not sure if I've ever taken a class at Yale that can be so complex but also boil down to such a clear picture. As for weaknesses, I thought the class moved a little slow at times. It seemed that Professor Schott took 3-4 lectures to explain a model when 1-2 could have worked sufficiently. I also question the testing methods in the course. The test questions felt much harder than any on the problem and seemed difficult to prepare for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Schott is a fantastic lecturer; he presents the theories in connection to the latest research or examples. \r\nWeaknesses: The evaluation of this course (problem sets and exams) barely correlate to the material learnt in class, which made many people not go to the lectures. The grading of problem sets is very arbitrary depending on the TF grading it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is pretty great. My only qualm is an over reliance on true/false/uncertain questions which sometimes felt like not the best way to test our understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Prof. Schott (smart, witty, great at engaging the class), the real-world studies every time we learned a new model helped ground the economic theory, the trade models themselves were very interesting. I think this is the best econ course I've taken at Yale (after 3+ years).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I don't think the TAs were the best at reviewing the material. But it's econ, so nothing shocking. ",
            "\u00a0I sincerely think that this course was one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale. It's an introductory course, so I didn't expect feeling like Einstein, but it provided me with a good understanding and overview of international trade. I don't know how to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the TF's should review the answers to pset and practice exams before office hours more. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are fantastically taught. The problem sets towards the end of the course were very good and helped supplement the course and didnt feel like a disparate part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nWell prepared slides really facilitated learning.\r\nProfessor Schott was very accessible!\r\nClass material was very relevant to the news in Trade Wars and Gains from Trade. \r\nTopics are fundamental for anyone seeking deeper understanding of Macroeconomics and International Economics---they are also fun! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nT/F style exam questions are a little bit hard to respond.\r\nAlthough the class topics are very interesting, the pset questions and the exam questions could be posed differently. Sometimes it is just hard to think the \"original\" cases of the models and graphs. \r\nMidterm feedback could be improved. It was a little bit hard to understand ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Schott, subject material, course structure\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture sometimes a little repetitive; wish more quantutative problems on psets (balance of that with true/false and real world) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Schott is a good professor, really wants to make sure everyone understands what's going on, material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: too much reliance on graphs and not nearly enough math...I think too much stock was put on having the lines exactly tangent versus demonstrating that you understand what the tangency means...on problem sets, it was very easy to just copy a graph from the slide and get full credit, and it seemed like the TAs were grading on the basis of whether you copied the \"right\" graph as opposed to whether you put some economic thought into it and got the answer. ",
            "\u00a0This course had great powrrpoints, but i sometimes got lost because of the quick pace ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schott is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. He makes every class interesting and engaging, even when the models can become very dense. The course could be improved with mandatory section. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and I learned a lot. However, the tests were all true and false which made me a little anxious. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are great. The perfect combination of challenging and doable which makes you really take the time to go through them and learn all the material. 75 minutes classes are sometimes a bit rough in the afternoonI could see 3 50 minute sessions working well for this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic. The lectures were always exciting and the course material was interesting and relevant. Professor Schott was by far the best lecturer I have had at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think this course has any weaknesses. One strength is that the professor always incorporates NYT articles in his slides after we learn about a trade model. That way, the class can see how the theories behind a specific model are exhibited in real life situations. Another strength is that the professor always asks us questions during his presentation. Even though the class is a lecture not a seminar, the questions keep the students engaged, get us thinking about the material, and encourage participation. ",
            "\u00a0Peter Schott is an excellent lecturer and provided great, in-depth lecture slides with links to many papers and research to support the slides. The material was varied enough to keep students like myself interested and in-depth enough to offer a strong understanding of international trade. I appreciated the option to work with a partner on problem sets. I thought the structure of the exams, True/False questions, to be at times confusing and frustrating. I also felt like grading could have been more fair, or at least the instructor and TA's could be more clear on what is expected. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are definitely a strength. Professor Schott is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, very patient and well-spoken, which made his lectures engaging and interesting. He takes questions whenever there are any. Some wording in problem sets are not very clear, and can be improved. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely, one of the most interesting and best tought econ classes at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Best economics course I have taken at Yale. But make sure you have enough time - the psets are long and graded for real. Only a great class if you can stay on top of the material. Professor Schott was awesome. First of all, the slides were COMPREHENSIVE and CLEAR. More economics classes should have that! The examples were RELEVANT, INTERESTING, and COMPREHENSIBLE. Again, more economics classes should try to emulate that. Schott was a great lecturer. Seriously, more economics field courses should model themselves after this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is an essential course for econ majors. It provides a great baseline and introduction to trade. I think non-econ majors would also benefit from this class because trade is such a big point of contemporary political and social debates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn more from a fantastic professor who is extremely knowledgeable about the topics. Be sure to get to know him in person through office hours; Professor Schott is very approachable. Beware of the tricky true/false/uncertain questions of the exams, since it may take a while for you to get used to it. Also make sure to allocate sufficient time to working on problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have any interest in international economics or are just looking for an Econ elective, absolutely take this class! You'll learn so much relevant material that's so pertinent to a lot of what you see in the news. Also, don't drop the class if you struggle with the first pset - it's just kind of rough. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially to another Econ major. This is easily the best Econ class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Schott is a very personable and engaging lecturer. The class is very well structured (the whole course is structured around 6-8 trade models. Each model is accompanied with real-world examples and a p-set). ",
            "\u00a0If you are an econ major, you have to take this course! It's not very challenging, but you learn a lot. Also, Peter Schott is a phenomenal teacher and a nice person! ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps, I would make sure that the student had taken intro micro (absolutely necessary toward the end). The psets can be very challenging because they are more like an extension of what we learned in lecture rather than what we actually learned. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. It is the best Econ course that I have taken at Yale so far. The professor is phenomenal and will change your view of trade economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. After intro micro/macro, international trade is the most necessary theoretical/practical subject for anyone interested in econ. Some of the models are more interesting and intuitive than others but overall really useful knowledge and relevant in todays globalized economy ",
            "\u00a0You should absolutely take this class! You will learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Fairly easy workload and interesting subject material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because intro/intermediate econ don't cover international trade very well, so if you're at all interested in the international aspect, this is a good foundation class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Please take this course. It is not an easy Economics elective but it is worth all the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to do the work and definitely find a problem set buddy - I did not have one and the TAs were not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are an Econ major you should 1000% take this. Schott is both a great human being and a great professor. I learned a lot and had an enjoyable time doing it. One of the best Econ classes I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. Really, you will be missing out if you don't take it. This class was so fun that the exams were actually really enjoyable - I was sad when the final was over. The problem sets and tests all consist of fun logic puzzles which are also relevant to people's lives and I found that super cool. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course is absolutely amazing. Now that I have finished the course, I feel that I have a much better understanding of how the world works and how trade affects countries around the world. Economics involves a lot of conceptual material and theories, and it is sometimes difficult to see how the material you are learning is applicable to the real world. However, this is one of the few classes in college that actually shows you how the material you are learning can be used in real life. I think that should be the number 1 priority for a college class - after all, the things you are learning now should prepare you for the future. The trade models you learn in Econ 184 help you analyze trade scenarios that you read about in famous newspapers, like the NYT or the Economist. Some of the questions on our problem sets and exams actually involved reading a NYT article and discussing how the situation relates to one of the trade models we learned in class. I found the material to be incredibly fascinating because it gave me a whole new perspective of the economic relationships among countries. I was never bored in class. The professor is also a really great teacher. He is super nice and energetic and always asked us questions during lecture to keep us engaged and make sure that we actually understand the material. The workload is not too bad, and even if it was one week, I always found the questions and material on the psets to be very thought-provoking and interesting. This class will always be one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great Professor, ingaging lectures and interesting material! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other Yalies. Not only will you learn cool trade models, Peter Schott is like the hip and cool dad your childhood friends had if that dad could teach trade economics and rode a bike everywhere. Seriously though, the course is super interesting and learning from Professor Schott has been a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the best economics class I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in macroeconomics, and the economic world at large, definitely take this class. It is interesting and extremely relevant. This semester, we learned the policy chapter (tariff, quota etc) in real time as Trump administration changed the tariff policies. ",
