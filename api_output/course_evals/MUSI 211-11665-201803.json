            "\u00a0Intro to Riemannian Theory, theories of rhythm, practice with basic voice leading rules ",
            "\u00a0Covers intermediate level music theory techniques, applied dominants, augmented sixth chords, chromaticism, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class has made me much better at analyzing music. I'm now able to scan pieces of music from the Classical and Romantic eras and identify the function of chromatic chords, where and how modulations are accomplished, (hyper)metric shifts, and when pieces wander through tonal space. Prof. Cohn did an excellent job explaining the beauty of each topic from a more mathematical standpoint; this gave me a deeper understanding of why our ears perceive complex music as beautiful. I've also become a better composer through our out-of-class assignments, thanks to Prof. Cohn's feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Some basic theory concepts and some things that are specific to Cohn's work. Advanced topics were skimmed and students who were able to understand them participated but others were left confused. "

            "\u00a0The course had a little too broad of an ability level. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and engaging. Challenging at times, but very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0One difficulty of the course was reconciling students' differing background knowledge, since there are differences between MUSI 210 classes, and some students didn't even take MUSI 210 at Yale. Prof. Cohn did an excellent job of accommodating the less prepared students for the first weeks of class, which was something I'd worried about before the term began. I really enjoyed the pace of the class, and I felt like the assignments were consistent in difficulty, though they felt a little more challenging at the beginning. I do think the class could've been improved had we analyzed more pieces out of class; with the extra practice, we might have been able to analyze pieces in class without such long pauses, and it would be interesting to see more examples of these topics in other music. ",
            "\u00a0Music theory is often taught to the highest level the students. So while it was great having a such a high quality professor, he was so smart and so were some of the other students in my class (years of theory experience) that I often felt lost and confused. In the end, I have been questioning how much I actually learned because most of the class time was spent being confused. While Cohn offered to work with me one on one, it did not seem fair for me to put in extra hours of work because I had taken the prerequisite classI was supposed to be prepared for this class. I felt very disappointed. "

            "\u00a0Even if you are not a music major, it is a good course to take is you wish to gain further understanding of music theory after 210. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to a student with an interest in the workings of music, but I'm not sure students who are passionate specifically about performing find it as enriching, as evidenced by some questions in class along the lines of \"But, why is this important?\" "
