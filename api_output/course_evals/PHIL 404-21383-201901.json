            "\u00a0The course was really great. The discussions operated at a very high level, and I wish the undergrads in the course had a separate section to discuss the readings amongst ourselves so we could feel more prepared to contribute in the seminar. That said, I also appreciated the grad student presentations in some of the weeks, which I always learned a ton from. "

            "\u00a0If you are curious about Leibniz from an exposure to him in Phil 126 or other courses, I think this is a great course to take. I would not take it without some prior exposure to early modern philosophy. Even having taken 126, I found the discussion to fly over my head at times because the class was mostly grad students. But MDR is more than willing to help you catch up in office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This is the course for you if you want a really good introduction to the strange but amazing philosophy of Leibniz. Michael Della Rocca has planned the syllabus well to allow the class to explore all the various aspects of Leibnizs philosophy. And the classes are arranged in such a way that helps you gradual ease in to his system. "
