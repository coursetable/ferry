            "\u00a0I got much better at Italian, very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Italian language, grammar, and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This course was crucial to devloping an understanding of the basics of the Italian language. With this, came a early understanding of the Italian culture when learning common phrases or words. Overall, it helped my language knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Basic communication in Italian, oral and written. Became comfortable with all tenses and most grammar points. Immersion was a big part of learning so quickly and internalizing the language. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great introduction to Italian language- it included concepts like greetings, verb conjugations, vocab, pronouns, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Italian ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my ability to speak, write, and understand the Italian language. I had no prior knowledge of Italian before starting the course, and, by the end of it, I truly felt that I had acquired a solid foundation in all of the previously mentioned aspects relating to the language. The accelerated rate of the class was especially effective at helping me learn. Both of my professors were also of Italian heritage. This helped in developing a deeper understanding of not only the Italian language but also of the Italian culture as they incorporated media in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really enjoyable! There is a lot of content and it is very fast-paced, but I learned a lot and the instructors were great. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The material was introduced in a systematic way that made it easy to learn and keep up.  Expectations could have been a little clearer concerning homework and participation and a few other things, but it didn't make a big difference in the class.  Megan and Teresa are wonderful teachers who clearly care not only about student learning but about students as people. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Took the course over the summer in Italy so there was practice available outside of the classroom. Great teachers.\r\nWeaknesses - Too much work and too stringent quiz/test schedule. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the intensity at which it was taught. Given how intense it was, it forced one to really commit to diving into the new language and practice. As far as I am aware there were not many things that could have been improved. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class from the very beginning. It has a steep learning curve and everything picks up really quickly, but it doesn't feel unnatural and the instructors made sure we had a firm grasp on everything before we moved on to a more difficult topic. With the pace of the summer course, it doesn't seem like there's much more they could be doing for us to learn the material as well. I really enjoyed watching the Fotoromanzo episodes, though I'm not sure how much that actually contributed to language learning other than listening and comprehension - which was covered by our lives in Siena anyway. ",
            "\u00a0The class had a pretty decent workload, but it was definitely essential to actually getting a good understanding of the language. The work was more than busy work and actually helped with the learning of the language. The weekly temas we would write and receive clear feedback on were very helpful. One issue I had was the textbook- it was absurdly overpriced and a new version was required for the online access code, however the online access code was used to complete exercises that were required before each exam, which I think could've been typed by professors and assigned instead. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Exams and quizzes always being on Mondays. Wish there was more time to gain a deeper understanding of the languages. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job of presenting material in a digestible form. The professors took their time in making sure all the students were understanding the material at hand. Furthermore, there were plenty of exercises to fortify the material learned. The professors would give us time to work on the exercises in groups or individually and then would also spend time going over answers or questions. These combined aspects made the course incredibly effective for active learning. ",
            "\u00a0The order of the content could be improved given there are things that it would be helpful to know sooner when you arrive in Italy. "

            "\u00a0Yes! The teachers were great and I learned the language much more quickly than I was expecting! It was challenging for me (someone who is naturally bad at learning languages) but with enough studying I could keep up.  One thing to keep in mind is that this course may be more challenging if you haven't taken a romance language before.  I had, though not as intensely as some other students, and it was often very difficult to see students fluent or even just ok at Spanish and French picking up the language much more easily than me.  If you are good at one of those languages this is definitely a class for you.  If you still want to take this class, even though you have no experience with romance languages, I'm sure you could still do well.  I got the impression that both teachers were very willing to help and to meet outside of class if necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - Megan and Teresa are amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course is a great way to develop a basic understanding of the Italian language as well as practice using it. It is a very rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend taking Italian as a summer program choice. I will never forget it. If you're interested in languages, it's also an amazing option at Yale, as the instructors seem to be very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone interested in learning Italian- it is a beautiful language and the department has very good profs! ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in gaining a basic, but solid, understanding of the Italian language. The course does not push you to extremes to keep up with the material. Instead, the course moves at a very natural pace to assist in your understanding. In addition, the professors are incredibly open to offering assistance both in and out of class. They are attentive and knowledgeable and make your learning experience their priority. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was so educative and fun. "
