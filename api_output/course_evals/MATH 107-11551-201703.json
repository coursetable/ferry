            "\u00a0You will learn A TON of different things that are hard to categorize since they are so disparate: some algebra, some pre-cal, some probability. This class is designed for students who struggle with math - being one such student, I would say that the level is still pretty challenging and lots of students (about 1/3) dropped the class throughout the semester. It is definitely not a gut unless you come into the class with previous ability in which case, take something else. ",
            "\u00a0Besides a lot of cool math tricks like Doomsday and the Monty Hall problem, I learned how to better think through math problems and how to not be so afraid of math in general! ",
            "\u00a0I learned various mathematical concepts and tricks, all of which had some sort of real world application. ",
            "\u00a0How to understand the basics- very helpful ",
            "\u00a0Math problems that can be useful in real life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about math in a new way beyond just trying to solve a problem. I also gained some interesting knowledge, such as encoding, that I wouldn't necessarily associate with math. I also discovered my own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to basic math concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to approach a problem from a general, rather than formulaic point of view and begin to dissect its various elements mathematically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of neat and interesting topics that are very applicable to the real world. Prof. Rosenthal was very engaging with the class making each class interesting and fun! Learned a lot of probability, counting, and fun world problems associated with gravity, acceleration, and distance. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0In theory, the class is assigned to make math accessible to students who have struggled in previous math classes. I found the textbook to be very poorly written and not as clear and straightforward as it claims to be. I spent more time on Kahn Academy than reading the book. This class could be improved by the students doing more of the work in class. Our professor would just stand at the board and do examples himself which is all fine and good except it didn't really give students a chance to work through the material with direct feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like the textbook very much (format was confusing, test questions were unlike the homework questions from book), but lectures and office hours were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is well-suited for the knowledge level of the course's target audience. I also found the material interesting and fairly easy to grasp, though I wish the concepts could've been interrelated. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fun and engaging way to learn basic mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher was great ",
            "\u00a0I think the problem stew should count a little more ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course is that it is an open course that covers any number of material up to the instructor. More than learning strictly math, we can learn how such concepts play a role in the things we use everyday. Perhaps my favorite parts of the course were the stories that accompanied the various problems. ",
            "\u00a0There are man strengths to this course. It was a great class for students that do not excel in the mathematics field but still required the individual to learn a lot of math. It was all in ways that were interesting and relatively pertinent for the present day. There were not really any weaknesses. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you need a QR and are ready to do some math that is, at the end of the day, still quite challenging, this course might be for you. A word of warning: the average grade on the first exam was a low C, so don't expect to waltz in and do well unless you have already taken lots of math in which case you shouldn't be taking this class. I think that the strengths of this class depend on the quality of the instructor which is, I have heard, quite hit or miss. ",
            "\u00a0A really solid math class if it's been a while since you've taken math and you miss the stuff that used to be fun -- algebra, probability, etc. Great if you didn't take calculus in high school. Prof. Rosenthal really tries to make it fun, and if you follow the study guides, you'll do well on the tests! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take the course! My favorite math class ever. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who isn't confident in their math abilities but still wants to learn some interesting mathematical concepts. ",
            "\u00a010/10! ",
            "\u00a0Yes- helpful to develop problem solving skills ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it teaches you new ways ways of understanding math and isn't as overwhelming as I imagine calculus would be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course to another student because while challenging, it still presents an option to those of us who didn't take calculus in high school. I feel as if at Yale if you didn't take calculus before than the maths above this are extremely difficult. ",
            "\u00a0yes i would highly recommend, especially a student that is not great at math, but still wants to learn in a fun and interesting manner. "
