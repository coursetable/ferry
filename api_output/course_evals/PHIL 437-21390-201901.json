The Professor is very deliberate about structuring class to maximize learning in the time you have, and that makes me really motivated to complete all of the readings and assignments to the best of my ability. You also get frequent feedback on your reading responses. I would recommend wholeheartedly, and Professor Shin is one of the most enlightening professors I've had the privilege of learning from. Weaknesses, if any, are that a lot of time is spent on student presentations, which can be less interesting than discussions -- but at least with this style, people actually know what they're talking about when discussions happen, and discussions aren't spent arguing points nobody understands.
