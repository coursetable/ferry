            "\u00a0I believe my writing skills and text analysis skills have really improved because of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed insights about the many texts we read as well as about broader issues covered by black women's literature. ",
            "\u00a0Wow. 4000 words is not enough to even begin to summarize what I learned from this course, so I will say that I learned most about the creation of identity through writing, publishing networks, and myself. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of how to read and analyze great works of literature in a way that was far different and overall BETTER than any other class I've taken at Yale about literature (which were very \"Western-centric\"). The books chosen were some of the best I've read in my life, and most of my classmates had really interesting things to say about them. I also really enjoyed writing the papers- Professor Goldsby is a wonderful grader in that she really wants to help her students improve as writers and puts in the time to give a lot of feedback. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a wide-ranging selection of Black women's writing, which was great, and it also helped develop analytical writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0An entirely new knowledge of the ways in which black women writers (from or living in America) have crafted the written word, how they have experimented with form and style and language in order to carve for themselves a selfhood. ",
            "\u00a0In this course we engaged with the canon of 20th and 21st century Black women's literature. I really appreciated the diversity of forms we read - poems, chapbooks, novels, plays. I feel better equipped to discuss and think through the importance and history of Black women's literature in American literary history. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading and connecting themes across an exciting, unfamiliar canon, and through our literary recovery project, researching literary criticism and cultural history to understand how a text was conceived and received. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to read novels, poetry, and academic articles for plot, idea, structure, and craft. It allowed me to gain a larger appreciation for the writing of black women, allowed me to conduct my own research, and allowed me to develop my own ideas in papers and in class discussions. The readings were great and exposed me to a variety of exciting new ideas. ",
            "\u00a0A substantive knowledge of certain works by black women writers, an awareness of the historical context of those works, an improved ability to read critically. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well organized and discussion was amazing. I really appreciated the low-stakes feel of essayettes (in that they are short) because they helped you make connections in material and help with improving writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fascinating and facilitated great discussion. Professor Goldsby is incredibly smart and knowledgable and a kind and good teacher.\r\n\r\nSometimes Professor Goldsby failed to shut down problematic things that were said in the class which was a bit frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Goldsby, syllabus, class discussions, essayetts, all assignments really\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this class was not due to any fault of the course design- we had two white men in our section who took up a lot of space and said problematic and unproductive things about our readings. Maybe some sort of explicit reminder to white cis-het male students that their contributions to discussions should take a backseat to others' would be useful. Other than that, I thought the readings & paper assignments were very reasonable and I enjoyed the class tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. I can't think of a way to improve it, except that the secondary readings could maybe be included more in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The selection of works was truly marvelous, and I so appreciated the supplemental reading. While I loved the non-linear structure, at times, I would have appreciated some kind of linear framework--even if it was just a discussion or handout-- in order to understand the work and authors in a historical timeline of sorts, to see how their work intersected and diverged. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is fantastic and I hope Professor Golsdby continues to teach it. Fast-paced reading schedule, but it was very rewarding to read so much together. The writing was not too heavy - 3 essayettes plus the larger Literary Recovery Project was a perfect amount of writing and allowed us the freedom to think through our own problems/questions in creative ways not bound to a regular \"English essay\" structure. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Goldsby is a wonderful instructor and discussion-leader. In addition to the instructor herself, the reading list is strong, with many excellent and thought-provoking texts in addition to useful secondary readings. Lastly, Professor Goldsby gives excellent feedback on written assignments and makes herself readily available to help students.\r\n\r\nI have a few critiques of the course.\r\n- READING LIST: I would recommend removing Janet Mock's \"Redefining Realness.\" Mock's story and the lessons it imparts are valuable. But the text does not strike me as literary, I wouldn't say it can fairly be compared in terms of themes, style, or complexity to the plays, novels, and poetry we read this semester.\r\n- DISCUSSION: Professor Goldsby did a great job keeping us focused and on track, especially when students would bring up broad points without a specific reference to the text. I think the class would benefit if she made it a more-explicit class expectation that class comments, whether broad or narrow in scope, should be grounded in text. I felt that that sometimes, students would speak just to speak, offering a broad comment about the reading or one of its themes. That's inevitable in seminars, and Professor Goldsby would push back against some comments (the obvious wait-what? ones), but I think she could have done more against other comments--not as anything against the students who said them, but rather to foster a rigorous seminar atmosphere, which I felt the class sometimes failed to cultivate. (So much of that depends on the students themselves, but I've been in a seminar or two where the instructor putting right amount of pressure on comments elevates the entire level of the conversation.)\r\n- PUNCTUALITY: This is a minor point, but Professor Goldsby often kept students for 5-10 minutes after the seminar was scheduled to end. Even if it meant to continue a high-value discussion, I often found that frustrating. \r\n- CLASS SIZE: The class would benefit if it were capped at 18 or fewer students. ",
            "\u00a0This course had many strengths. The workload was appropriately heavy; I appreciated the opportunity to learn about the writings of a large number of black woman writers. Professor Goldsby guided discussions well, selected a great syllabus, and curated exciting extracurricular opportunities like a field trip and talks we might be interested in. I would have liked to see more black students and black women in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its fantastic syllabus, its pacing which feels perfect, never rushed and never complacent, and its professor. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Goldsby is amazing and insightful both in her class and in office hours (go to them!). The class discussion however didn't feel particularly cohesive or exciting until maybe 2/3 of the way through the course. Don't know what would've fixed it but it was never a bad class. I looked forward to going each morning. "

        [
            "\u00a0Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, and yes! This class was amazingthe readings were stellar and Professor Goldsby is so intelligent, kind, and committed to her students. There's a reason everyone in the class was so engaged throughout the semester. If you get a spot, do not pass this class up. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to others. It was enlightening and classroom discussion was thoughtful. Professor Goldsby is so kind and willing to sit down with you to flesh out ideas. If you have the slightest interest, I recommend taking it. Pretty sure it's my favorite course at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to put in a reasonable amount of work, I would definitely recommend this course. You read a book every week or two and have fascinating class discussions of that book. The essayettes aren't too hard but definitely make you keep up and think critically. The only thing I didn't love about this class was the two white boys in my section, and that wasn't Professor Goldsby's fault. ",
            "\u00a0This was, without a doubt, the best class I've taken at Yale. I would recommend this to any student who is serious about literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you should definitely take this class if you get in. You'll read texts by Black women in a very intense way- if you engage fully with the course you'll definitely become a better reader and writer during the semester. \r\n\r\nSpeaking to other white people- take this class if your other seminars about literature are filled with mostly white faces (on the syllabus and in person). It is essential to read literature written by people whose experiences you can't relate to on certain levels, in a space that is not designed to make you feel comfortable to the extent that other literature classes are. That said, the space and the class do not exist to make you less racist, so, if you're white and are approaching it with that kind of attitude, maybe don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class! Professor Goldsby is smart and engaged, the readings are awesome, and the assignments are manageable and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Prof. Goldsby is a dynamo of a professor, a true, fierce intellectual heavyweight whose passion for her work and the text often inspired me to feel similarly.  I'm so grateful for her boldness in, at times, revealing the personal along with the academic, not being afraid to express her personal experiences (which, in many ways, complemented the very form of the works we were reading, the kind of epistemologies that they adopt). Furthermore, she is so understanding and gracious and caring for her students' wellbeing and intellectual advancement. This course really opened me up to the possibilities of how writers might bend language and form to create for themselves a space in a white-male-dominated cannon-- and I can't wait to read more, to find out what is next. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - this is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Goldsby is incredible, and if not this class, every English major should take a class with her at some point. The reading load was challenging and fast-paced, but it was rewarding to read so many different kinds of texts together. Writing load is not heavy at all for an English course. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. It has an excellent reading list. I had little exposure to this body of works and am far better off for the experience. Also, our literary recovery project (in which we worked extensively with literary criticism, cultural history, and other resources to explore an under-discussed author, text, or topic) helped me develop a new set of skills in literary and historical analysis.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goldsby is a wonderful instructor. She gives extensive and instructive feedback on written assignments, makes herself available to work one-on-one with students, and does a good job guiding class discussion. \r\n\r\nI think the class would benefit if she put more pressure on students for their comments to be specific and grounded in the text, since I often felt that our discussions were hit-or-miss in terms of intellectual rigor. Obviously, that's true of all seminars, and it also depends mainly on who else takes the class, but it seemed to me that some students spoke only broadly about the text or its themes. While Professor Goldsby was quick to push back on some comments--especially the ones that were obviously off-topic--she did not for others, and I think that took away from how deep of an analysis we could have achieved. \r\n\r\nBesides that, the class would benefit if it were smaller (20 students made the class feel too large).\r\n\r\nThese minor things aside--yes! Take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this class. You should take it only if you are passionate about reading literature and discussion, writing, and coming up with ideas about the literature, blackness, and womanhood in an academic setting. If that sounds appealing to you, the class will be great; Professor Goldsby is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an absolute wonder. Every book and essay and poem you read is amazing, the classroom dynamic is somehow extremely spirited and democratic, the paper topics and prof Goldsby's signature essayettes are a delight and a challenge. I did not skip a single class despite the fact that we met twice a week at 9am. For me this is highly unusual behaviour. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Golsby is soooo great! "
