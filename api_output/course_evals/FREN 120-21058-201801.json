            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the focus on the auditory and vocal part of language learning, which is something that most high school language courses fail to focus on. The French department at Yale is really great and they've definitely discovered a great method for teaching a new language rapidly. The only weakness for me was the relatively heavy workload during reading week and finals period where you have a written finals as well as an oral presentation within the span of 4-5 days. "

            "\u00a0If you want to learn French, Yale is the place to do it. The course is definitely worth it and the hard work pays off. You will be speaking French much quicker than you expect to and will gain a very good grasp of the written, spoken as well as auditory parts. "
