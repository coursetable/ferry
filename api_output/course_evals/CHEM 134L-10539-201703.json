This course is truly not terrible: the lab reports, although long and tedious, can be banged out in maybe 2 or 3 hours (other reports took 4 hours). However, you can listen to music and start and finish a lab report in 2-3 hours and get a 55/60 points on it. Not much effort goes into the lab reports, but the reports are just tedious, time-consuming, and overall wants to make you drop out. The reason why I say drop out is because this class only awards you .5 credits, but it feels like 1.5 credits: the amount of work (not intellectual challenge) is so much higher than my other courses.

Dr. G demands an extremely high level of work and organization, while also routinely forgetting to enter student's quizzes into the grade book and then blaming it on them. The lab reports were long and tedious and I learned nothing except for how to spend far too much time fussing with formatting in Word and Excel. The course is supposedly meant to weed out premeds, but is only half a credit freshman year so even does a poor job of that. Instead it just routinely ruined my day.

Perhaps the course could be presented in a more friendly way; lots of people told me I wouldn't enjoy the course (but I did) and I think that's because the course comes across as scary to some. If the course were presented more as an interesting study of experimental science, it might be more enticing, and ultimately more rewarding for students who otherwise see it as a source for a lot of work and stress.

The course currently has us using suction bulbs rather than micro pipets or easier handheld scrolling pipets (not entirely sure what they are called). Considering there was a big emphasis on both precision and accuracy, the equipment we were given made achieving both those aims more difficult for no real reason. Thirdly, I don't really see the point of the lab reports in their current form. They don't reflect the format of published scientific papers and instead become more like harshly graded worksheets. I would encourage the course to consider reducing the number of lab reports and add a component where we take time to learn about how scientific papers work and are formatted. ",

I also didn't really like the idea of makeup week and how if you get above a certain percent error in a lab you must come back to redo the lab for several trials until you improve your accuracy. I think that perhaps it would be better if we can do more labs and drop a lab/quiz to reduce stress and make the course more enjoyable for everyone.

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Very strict grading, lots of points lost for minor errors, pretty unforgiving in that sense but also the strength as it is a brutal teacher sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The course was graded very strictly and the rubric was convoluted/not disclosed. Quizzes could be confusing at times. The course was well structured  in terms of labs and reports, however, and the TAs were patient and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it taught me more about basic laboratory procedure. I completely appreciated the effective lectures from Dr. G and the great instruction from my TA. However, there are many aspects of Chemistry 134L that I believe need to be changed in order to make the course better and to benefit more students. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the fact that there is only one \"General Chemistry Lab\" for both Chem 161 and 163 students caused several issues. For many 161 students taking chemistry for the first time, Chem 134L covered completely new material, while myself and other 163 students were left rehashing old material. This divide in the course left the professor and the TAs attempting to teach students at very different levels of preparedness and was quite ineffective.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the course was not set up well to actually facilitate learning. Before each period, we needed to read the lab manual and study the material for the upcoming experiment. In the beginning of the period, we had a lecture on the material we read and then were immediately quizzed on it after the lecture. It would have been far more effective to learn in the lecture, have time to read and study before the next period, and then be quizzed on said material. While the quizzes were not extremely difficult or in any way unfair, they could have covered deeper concepts or encouraged actual learning if they were set up differently.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the grading of the class was extremely confusing and unintuitive - often unfair. No real grading rubric was ever given to the students, so we were in the dark as to how lab reports were being scored. Halfway through the course, our TA gave us a rudimentary rubric that was even more confusing - it marked off in certain \"categories\" that would add together certain \"shortcomings\" to count up total \"problems.\" I have never seen such an odd grading system, as it created extremely strange weightings for certain categories. Stranger still, the only possible grades on lab reports were 60/60, 50/60, 45/60, 30/60, and 0/60, according to this rubric - nothing in between. Later in the course, I was told that even this rubric was scrapped and that some other system was being used, but we were never told what this system was. I simply wish that we were told how we were being graded. One final note on grading - the vast majority of points seemed to be taken off on strange aspects of the reports. I acknowledge that report formatting is important. However, I was very confused that, for example, using the present tense and passive voice just once in a ten-page report warranted being marked off 5 points for grammar. We were also never given clear expectations on how the \"Purpose\" sections of our reports were being grades, and it became common to lose points for aspects of the report that would have been easy if expectations were made clear.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this is less important, but many of the experiments conducted in the lab were mundane and tedious. I completely understand that many students in this course are new to the lab environment and that all experience-based learning is valuable. However, one particular experiment had us doing what were essentially 8 almost identical titrations in one period. It was repetitive and unnecessary. Another experiment had us swirling, by hand, a flask containing a small amount of liquid and metal shavings, for a minimum of twenty minutes to cause a reaction. This was then repeated for a total of three times, taking up at least 1 hour out of the 4 hour lab period. Minor issues compounded like this made Chem 134L far less effective than I think it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0The experiments are fairly simple and easy to understand, and they cover a lot of ground that is useful for other science classes. The questions asked in the lab reports are very clear and for the most part encourage a good understanding of the procedures that were covered in the experiments. More specific feedback on the lab reports would be helpful, however. ",
            "\u00a0The course is mostly busy work--lab reports take up to 7 hours to write up but the bulk of this time is not actual learning. Maybe 1 hour is spent on calculations and extension questions, the rest is spent formatting the work on Microsoft word, which takes forever. Given the inspirational quality Chemistry can have, it is disappointing that this course takes such a basic, boring approach and forces students to invest huge amounts of time in the formatting of lab reports and making graphs instead of trying new, exciting experiments or thinking deeply about the reactions taking place. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the class was well organized. The main weakness was that the lab reports were graded very ambiguously, and too much emphasis was on formatting issues such as significant figures. I believe that this takes away from the gaining of useful chemistry knowledge. ",

The grading was also very constraining, where each error, no matter the error, was 5 points off. Maybe doing something more along the lines of a case by case grading where a small sig fig error isn't the same grade reduction as not an meeting an entire question. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course definitely teaches you lab techniques well.\r\n\r\nThe way lab reports are graded is quite strange and not really conducive to student learning, in my opinion. I think it would make sense to grade them normally, with a rubric, instead of taking off 5 points for each type of mistake. \r\n\r\nI also don't like the format of the lab practical. I feel like it's too easy for a student to do everything correctly and carefully and get above a 1% error for their results, which doesn't seem fair. ",

Instead, the TAs usually encouraged us to just restart, sometimes without us even knowing what went wrong to prevent future errors. ",

            "\u00a0I faced several issues during this course that unfortunately were not resolved. Firstly, there appeared to be some sort of technical issue that prevented me from accessing the comments on my lab reports on the Canvas. I was not the only student who faced this issue. I was told to go to office hours in order to receive the comments, but this was not always convenient for me. I take responsibility for not having gone to office hours, but I do recommend and request that this issue be addressed for future students so that they can easily access their comments. \r\n\r\nSecondly, there were certain issues with the final exam. When I was preparing the solution in the final exam, I had to use the analytical balance in order to find the mass of the powder. (Note that I was using the balance much after most of the other students, since I had begun my lab time doing other preparations.) However, the analytical balances appeared not to be working correctly as the readings kept going lower and lower, even after I grounded myself and tried again. I asked my TA Yizhou Zhao to have a look because I was not certain why this was happening. He watched me working and also commented that it was \"weird\" that the analytical balances were behaving in this manner. I think it is most likely that this was the cause of the error in my value in the end (since the titration values were extremely close, and less likely to be the major source of error.). I cannot be certain whether error in my value was due to other mistakes I made or whether I myself was doing something wrong with the analytical balance, but I do think that this issue with the equipment was probably a major contributor to the error. I would just request in the future, just in case, to be very careful about the equipment for the final exam and to have a system to address and record student complaints about the equipment during the exam.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than these issues, the course was very well organized and structured, and should probably stay as it is.

This class places emphasis on the results as well as the process, stressing the importance of accuracy. Of course, that's science. I will be honest that at first I really did not enjoy this course, and it caused me a lot of grief and anxiety. But I'm not someone to blame the course itself for my difficulties, just because the course is hard. I did find the grading harsh, with too many points taken off for small errors. It was frustrating that one error in a section counted as much as 5 errors in the same section. If one tiny error got me points off for the entire section, why did I spend so much time fretting over it? I could've completely flubbed it and been in the same spot. But if I don't get introduced to that standard now, when will I? Science in the laboratory is about accuracy, and learning to be careful. I was able to get gradually better over time, and that matters most to me. ",

It's incredibly stressful because of the structure, though. Lab reports are graded harshly, so it's important to read over multiple times, painstakingly looking for a single error that could turn an A into a B (or worse). The practical final requires the same sort of razor-sharp focus, which is good for the future but quite difficult in the moment. The biggest weakness of this class is the emphasis on busywork. ",
            "\u00a0Let us start off with the strengths: this course introduces you to basic lab technique, and you can have fun suffering together in lab with your lab partner and members of your lab group while doing the lab. Honestly, try and make lab fun, and it will not be that bad. However, I was gifted with the amazing TF Staci Hill, whom made lab so much more tolerable and enjoyable. However, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths: this course is poorly designed (especially in reference to the grading rubric). The grading rubric is convoluted and makes no sense. However, if you go to Dr. G.'s office hours, you will probably get a 60/60 on each lab report (although no one says anything about going to office hours). Also, this class is graded on a curve, which means the average grade (be it median or mean) is a B or B+, and then he will inflate AND DEFLATE your grade depending on how you match up to the average score. Another weakness of this course is that you meet once a week FOR FOUR HOURS (1-5pm on any selected day M-F). And please do not pick friday labs unless you have to: it just makes your weekend that much shorter. Do not take this course if you do not have to, it will only be pain and suffering for no reward (except staining your clothes with potassium permanganate or getting a 25/60 on your final). ",

By giving students almost full independence in the lab, it provided an opportunity to take charge in the lab and learn by trial and error. A weakness of this class was the weekly quizzes. I felt they were unnecessary, and could have been replaced by a quiz that focused on lab conduct instead of chemistry content that was taught in an entirely different class. ",

The weakness of this course is that it's a half-credit class with twice the work. While labs are very interesting, the lab reports are tedious to write. While it is structured, and students are informed of the type of information/data that should be included, lab reports are very time consuming and are often graded with a lot of nitpicking (including grammar errors), so it can be difficult to tell what the grader wants. I would suggest changing the way lab reports are graded, such as not taking off 5 points for a sentence with bad grammar, and focusing more on providing feedback that help students improve on writing their reports. ",

Dr. G's lab report rubric was also ridiculous and he was unnecessarily anal-retentive about very small details.

One thing in particular I disliked about the procedural sheets was that procedures were never given directly and often required close reading to decode what procedures were. I understand that this might be a method to get us to read the material closer and learn more, but to have this kind of procedure sheet in LAB makes lab work incredibly tedious and necessitated me to write my own separate procedure sheet. Now, yes, this probably taught me how to make my own procedure sheet, but it was frustrating every week to say the least. ",

I didn't like how divorced from each other the two courses were, and I think the lab could be improved if there were two versions of it, one for each intro chemistry class, and they complemented these chemistry courses better. \r\n\r\nSometimes it felt like the experiments that we did were made to be longer than they needed to be in order to fill the lab period. Some of them could have been completed in shorter periods of time if they had been designed a little differently, so it felt like they were stretched out unnecessarily just so they would take us the whole lab period. \r\n\r\nThe course could also be improved if we received more feedback on our lab reports. In most cases were I missed points on my report, there were no comments explaining what I should have done differently or what was wrong about what I wrote. If I wanted to understand what I should have written, I had to come to Dr. G's office hours. For small mistakes, it would be much better and help us write better lab reports if Dr. G and the TAs gave short explanations when they graded our reports. ",

There is essentially no autonomy within this course, so if you like to be spoon-fed then it is perfect. ",
