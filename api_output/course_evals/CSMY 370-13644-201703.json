            "\u00a0I developed a basic knowledge of international law and espionage, as well as specific espionage techniques employed by a variety of intelligence services and other actors. ",
            "\u00a0I came away from this course with a vastly improved understanding of international law. In additionI I feel this course challenged me to think outside my comfort zone and examine how legal frameworks can and cannot be applied to the largely enshrouded field of espionage. I also believe that my ability to conduct research and apply legal analysis in my writing improved. The depth of reading and analyzing required especially in our legal memo assignments presented a challenge I greatly enjoyed working with. I came to this class passionate about the subject but ill-equipped to truly understand it, upon leaving I feel I have some of the necessary tools to pursue international law, human rights and espionage further. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an incredible job of preparing you for what a law school class may look like. You learn how to write legal memos, interpret international law, and understand many of the contemporary issues we are dealing with involving cyber law and mass surveillance. Espionage and International Law is unlike any other class I've taken at Yale. You learn so many new skills. I would recommend to people who aren't even thinking much about law school because the subject material is so interesting. You're talking about spying, Snowden, human rights, and so much more! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write legal papers, and how to think about issues in international law in terms of various frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned proper legal analysis and how to analyze topics not from a fluffy IR perspective, but a perspective grounded in true legal analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the law, international institutions, relevant technology and jurisprudence.  I also learned how to write a legal memo. ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to the principles of international humanitarian and human right law, as applied to espionage. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an excellent understanding of international law. After taking this course, I feel comfortable reading legal documents, conducting an analysis of these texts, and debating the issues which are involved. I think I am prepared to take courses in this field in law school, and I'm excited to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about the basic structure of the international legal order and its ambiguous, tenuous nature. This class also covered the basics of cyber attacks and other cyber related topics in depth. I think I gained a broader understanding of what legal analysis looks like and how to apply it. Honestly there was so much material and information I dont think I can even keep track of it all. But this class covered a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Foundations of espionage (through case study analysis) and international law that will be applicable as I prepare for law school applications and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0I developed critical thinking and analytical skills for evaluating legal questions and interpreting laws. "

            "\u00a0It was the most interesting course I've taken at Yale. At times, I think the class went a little too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0One major strength of this course was its ability to cover a wide sector of legal and technical concepts with sufficient depth as to not leave me feeling in the dark about any one thing. However, due to the pace I feel that class at times suffered from the need to constantly assimilate new knowledge without enough pauses to digest and wrestle with some of the concepts taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course has many strengths. At the top of the list is Professor Lubin because he is incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and accessible. Another strength is how fascinating the subject material is. We learned about cases being taken up by the Supreme Court during the semester. The course does move at a very fast pace and can be overwhelming at times, but this improved as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength of the class is that each week, we alternated class lessons with student presentations on cases related to what we learned. This allowed us to apply what we learned to group presentations, and to spark discussion in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to the topic of international law and espionage/intelligence. That being said, I wish that sometimes there was a bit more organization in how the class was taught (via powerpoints and the structure of the syllabus; some topics felt a little disjointed). Overall, though very strong course. ",
            "\u00a0The class does a great job in that you really do learn a ton.  Its biggest strength is that Asaf does a great job in keeping everyone involved and engaged with the class and is VERY helpful in terms of helping you to learn in any way possible. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent introduction to the legal and policy issues (privacy rights, jurisdictional conflicts, foreign relations implications, etc.) that surround intelligence collection. Excellent use of weekly quizzes to make sure that students understood the material. This really helped when the final rolled around.  \r\n\r\nHonestly can say that I have no complaints. Just wish that there were more classes like this offered at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were incredibly hard, but the professor was willing to help students succeed. He met with each student in a one-on-one setting, and he gave exceptionally detailed feedback. Even though it might have seemed difficult, I think that we learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the topics were interesting, Asaf is super enthusiastic and goes out of his way to help you out, in class and outside of it. Major weakness was that despite being a seminar it was taught almost exclusively through lectures, with the exception of student presentations. The information dump in every class was, frankly, overwhelming, and I often left class with a headache from trying to follow everything. Fortunately as the semester wore on the material started to coalesce a bit and the structure of the final actually did force a better understanding of how topics related. I have two recommendations for improving the course, focused on the same principlethere needs to be better incentive to really engage and learn the material (including stuff that just requires memorization) throughout the semester, not just for the final. I definitely feel like if Id had to memorize the treaty articles and case information class by class, while probably annoying, it would have made the lectures more important. So towards that end: make the quizzes count for something- maybe just a nominal portion of the grade- but just a little something to force you to learn the stuff. Thy could even be simpler and just focus on factual information. For example, frequent vocab quizzes in a language class force you to learn words that you can then apply to discussion writing etc. Those treaty articles were the vocabulary of the class, and I think we all would have benefited from being forced to memorize them along the way rather than the end of the semester. The second note on that is to work to include more class discussion. I think it would increase buy-in a lot, and also make everyone more accountable for doing the readings. When we did discuss it was highly interesting, given how debatable so many of the topics are. But opportunities for discussion were scant. Frankly, in their current form I dont think the quizzes added all that much, but they took almost 40?minutes of class time every class, that could be put instead to discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course, in all honesty, has no weaknesses - it is multimodal which keeps classes interesting, readings are challenging but are then deconstructed during the seminar (no 'dumbed down' undergraduate legal readings), case study presentations are exciting and give a unique insight into the development of contemporary espionage regulations (or the lack thereof), and the professor is absolutely brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course.  Very well structured and gives students a crash course in a particular area of international law, while still providing them with more general skills they can utilize when faced with legal questions of any type. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If a student is passionate about IR, international law, the role of cyber in modern IR, or espionage, I highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to any student passionate about international law or even law in general. I think it would be an excellent introduction for anyone considering law school. However, I would present the caveat that you truly get the most out of this class when you are able to passionately engage with the subject material. The workload is considerable, and if taken in conjunction with other challenging classes it may feel overwhelming. Therefore, I would not make a blanket recommendation but rather suggest it to someone who I am sure is already highly interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to any student who is willing to put in the work. Espionage and International Law was one of the top two classes I've taken thus far at Yale. You will learn a ton about human rights law, regulating espionage and intelligence gathering under international law, and the technology behind mass surveillance and government hacking. It is a super relevant class and Professor Lubin has a knack for keeping things interesting for the full 2 hour seminar. If you do decide to take the course, be willing to put in the work. You have to write two big papers, make a group presentation, and take a tough final. But rest assured that Professor Lubin is a very reasonable grader and most students do very well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students willing to work hard, interested in having an experience somewhat like that of a first year law school student, and interesred in espionage and how technology is transforming international law. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course and Asaf is incredibly enthusiastic about the material. As a former practitioner and now academic in the world of law and intelligence, he provides a compelling perspective about these issues. It is important to realize that this is not an overview of intelligence as it relates to law, but rather a legal analysis-based approach to understanding more international law itself, rather than intelligence specifically. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. This class was fantastic.  Asaf does a fantastic job teaching, and you come out of the course feeling like you have a grasp on relevant law and treaties, as well as the jurisprudence on it.  Furthermore, you learn how to write legal memos.  The instructor is extraordinarily helpful and is willing to go over drafts of your papers as well as to meet to talk about the class or just life in general.  Be prepared to work though - the readings can be dense, but more importantly legal memos take a long time to research and write.  That being said, the class is run in such a way that you DO put in the time and effort and as such, most of the class comes out with a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0The most incredible class I've taken. Highly, highly recommended for anyone interested in the field who wants first-rate instruction and isn't afraid to do the extra work. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite courses at Yale! Worth the challenge. You should take it if you get the chance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes It was highly interesting and I definitely learned a lot. Just be aware that this course is pretty different from most seminars at yale. Its highly focused on knowledge acquisition, eschewing much of the and-now-lets-talk-about-what-we-all-think elements of a lot of seminars. This is decidedly a plus in a lot of ways, as you actually learn something concrete, however it tips a little bit beyond the proper balance. But this was also the first time it was taught and Im sure the structure will improve. Asaf is awesome, and highly enthusiastic, if perhaps sometimes so gung-ho its hard to get a grasp on the volume of material. As he will likely tell you, one of his goals for the class is to expose you to what law school is like. In this regard no doubt the course is quite successful, but I do think that may come slightly at the expense of the learning as much as possible about espionage and international law. Overall though, a quality course with room for improvement. An interesting look at global interactions from a different angle. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - anyone interested in having a taster for law school, explore their interest in technology or have an unglamorized understanding of espionage MUST take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course just based on the enthusiasm of Professor Lubin alone. He's the most engaged professor I've had at Yale and he's whip smart.  He's always there to help you and really makes the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you are so lucky, absolutely take this class. Lubin is incredible and puts his heart and soul into this class. It's perfect if you're thinking about law school and want to double check your intentions. He runs it like a law class and even takes mid-semester feedback about how it's going (and then acts on it, he's a great person to talk to about law school and open to such conversation). You will read cases, modern legal theory, recent articles, and even watch a fun video here or there. He even set up a library session so we could learn how to do legal research at Yale for the legal memos and beyond. Your opinions about what espionage is and when it should be allowed or not will certainly change or be expanded upon. Read the syllabus, it's pretty accurate and probably even more refined. You will see (or continue to see) how important International Law is even if people think it's a pipe-dream. It's very possible and critical work and Lubin will work to convince you of such. This is a cutting field of law and he is at the top of it. I think we all have a lot to learn from him and are very lucky he's also interested in teaching. You don't need a lot of pre-knowledge about the subject but you should certainly be interested as the class is very focused (but not overly technical). I could go on and on but I'll stop here. Take it if you can get in. "
