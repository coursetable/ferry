            "\u00a0I learned about 8 different traditions that represent a number of different cultures and belief systems. More importantly, I developed a way to approach these traditions and take parts of each to construct a personal vision of a life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge and insights on a variety of traditions and religions. Not having grown up with religion in my house, I had always been curious about learning the basics. Additionally, I learned how to discuss and analyze religious and modern texts with a variety of students from different backgrounds. Finally, I gained a lot of insight on my own beliefs and definition of a life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0I gained invaluable insights from studying different traditions and conceptions about a life worth living. I enjoyed this course more than any other this semester! ",
            "\u00a0Teaching me the right questions to ask. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a little bit about each of the major religious traditions and few philosophical schools of thought including nietzschianism and expressive individualism. ",
            "\u00a0A structure for evaluating the various visions of a life worth living espoused by a variety of schools of thought/exposure to a variety of traditions, philosophical, religious and cultural in nature ",
            "\u00a0Asking the hard questions and coming up with initial answers for them. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured in a brilliant way that focuses on some key questions in each religion/philosophy, so every week you are testing your own value with a certain religion/philosophy, and gradually figure out what your own life vision is ",
            "\u00a0How to live my life - what could be more valuable than that. This course gives you a nice framework of principles to reflect on your life. Its amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Learned a good deal about other traditions, but most importantly how to have positive discussions about sensitive issues. "

            "\u00a0This class was structured incredibly well. I loved the balance of having small, discussion-based seminars twice a week and then lectures once a week to supplement the traditions by showing examples of practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: The key strength was the variety of topics we were able to cover and yet retain a depth of conversation. The guiding course questions were critical in helping us to remain targeted, yet understand a good portion of the tradition.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Some of the lecturers on Thursday were better than others. I though the Islam representative was phenomenal and the Judaism women was also great. I would have appreciated more storytellers and personal narratives. Giving ample time for questions was great. ",
            "\u00a0The strenghts are the broad overview of 8 different traditions throughout the course of the semester. Something that could be improved are the speakers that embody a certain tradition. Some speakers were fantastic while others were not, which is why a better screening and planning of these lecturers and speakers could improve an already excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Seminar discussion was always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The 2-seminar, 1-lecture structure is really wonderful. It let's you engage with the texts and traditions in two very different ways, which I think gives a slightly more holistic perspective on the traditions considering we only had 1 week with each. The one improvement I could think of is if the teaching staff did more research into the texts for Buddhism and Islam. I think the teaching staff is less familiar with these and it showed in the text selection. That being said, the guest speakers for those traditions in particular were two of the best of the semester in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0LWL is a survey-style course, so although an incredible amount of effort is made to acknowledge this perspective as we evaluate each tradition, there is inevitably a level of speculation. That said, instructors are very receptive to feedback, and personal experience and insight is always welcomed and greatly adds to the quality of the discussions! ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Awesome course that everyone should take! The selection of topics and the key question is really brilliant\r\nWeakness: sometimes the discussion could still wander and it would be great if there are ways to facilitate discussions better (like a mind map, we used that for two times in class and it's really helpful for me) ",
            "\u00a0Could focus on more specific traditions (we never talked about Hinduism), but otherwise was very strong. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. You will have fascinating discussions about questions that are so important for us as college students to consider. I feel better equipped to leave Yale and find my path going forward. You will also get very close with the other students in your class! ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course was mandatory. By learning about the variety of traditions and being asked to self-reflect, I feel that this course makes students more tolerant of different beliefs and sets them up for success moving forwards. Knowing the bigger picture of what you strive towards and what is really meaningful to you will continue to guide you long after the details from other lectures have faded. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any Yale Student. On a personal and professional level the course allows you to understand different ways of viewing the world and shape your own conception of what a life worth living looks like. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it challenged my own assumptions. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it! Do the readings and you will gain a lot from this class, your peers and their perspectives and the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a wonderful opportunity to ponder the biggest, most important questions of life that need much more time than we give them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend! One of the BEST class I took at Yale (speaking as a junior) which really helped me streamlined a lot of life questions and philosophy. TAKE IT IF YOU GOT IN! Writing that last paper about my own life vision is such an enjoyable process for me. And I also received great friendship from this class through talking about life philosophy together! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this to another student. I think this is one of the most important classes one can take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great opportunity to get in touch with your spiritual side. "
