            "\u00a0Learned a ton about international economies and markets, as well as foreign aid and political cooperation. Very accessible (I had no background in econ, poli sci, or foreign affairs. ",

Examining statistical methods to evaluate others' research. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, we learned a variety of theories and models that worked towards explaining economic and political preferences of various actors. As we built up our toolkit of knowledge, we were also exposed to the relevance and importance of these frameworks in the salient issues of today, such as regarding immigration or climate change. From trade preferences to the efficacy of foreign aid to the collective action problems that wrack international cooperation regarding climate change, I received a very thorough and comprehensive introduction to what international political economy is and how politics and economics very much are intertwined in the international arena. ",

            "\u00a0Grading was two homework assignments (max 6 pages each), midterm, final, occasional pop quizzes, and participation. I was very disappointed that the only way to get participation credit was to ask questions in lecture (no option to submit questions before or after, or anything else counted in). I think in the future, it would be better to have the pop quizzes AND participation count into the same part of the grade, so that one can bolster the other (personally, I and most people don't feel comfortable asking questions in a lecture, so the discussion was dominated by two students).\r\n\r\nAfter a few glitches, the homework assignments ended up being fairly graded. The midterm was easy but definitely tested whether or not you understand what we had learned.\r\n\r\nI really was mad that the final got switched to a take home longer homework assignment, because I purposefully took the class because it didn't have a paper-type final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent professor and TA, both were incredibly knowledgeable and approachable, the course content was excellent, lectures were organized perfectly, slides were understandable and synthesized well from the readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class was full of students who never attended until after they realized participation counted . . . which made discussions at times disappointing since they were dominated only by a few students. \r\n\r\nThe macroeconomic theory was also pretty basic, and I would recommend having some form of introductory macroeconomics requirement so that the material can go more in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0The course involved a lot of interesting topics related to political economy, and the readings complimented the lectures well. The assignments were also fair. I personally felt like there were some mistakes and misunderstandings during the course because it was the Professor's first time teaching it, and the pace and assignments were sometimes off. ",
            "\u00a0Great accessibility to resources and TA and professor. The participation grade part was very vague and subjective and put students at an extreme disadvantage because we had no standard or rubric for that and didnt know what resulted in a good grade for that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Queralt's lectures were well organized. Weaknesses: More discussions could be encouraged between students, and questions in the assignments could be worded more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the easy-to follow, informative lecture format. Professor Queralt was also an engaging speaker who readily interacted with student questions. I do think that in the future, it would be helpful to have a more comprehensive midterm exam that better gauged a student's knowledge of the course; the exam this semester was only 25 points and covered only basic ideas present in the material. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly really enjoyed the course very much. It was clear that Professor Queralt knew a lot about the material and I appreciated how he always made sure to keep everything we learned fresh and relevant. Despite there not being a prerequisite course in economics or statistics, Professor Queralt challenged us to approach the class materials as a true social scientist wouldbut was sure to take the time to explain more advanced concepts or statistical findings of research papers to us. Furthermore, I thought the readings really helped to enhance the course and were honestly some of the most interesting readings Ive done. If there is one weakness, it would be that I wish this were a seminar so we could have even more discussion about the material, though Professor Queralt did address some of this through participation. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a lecture with no discussion section. I think that Professor Queralt should have made his expectations for participation much clearer at the beginning of the course, as the participation score had a significant impact on my score. Active participation is required, but in a large lecture it is difficult to do so. There is usually a discussion section for a class this size where it is much easier for students to actively participate in discussion. If the class remains a lecture, then I think the participation aspect for the final score should be removed or add a discussion section. Otherwise, make the class a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The material we learn is really cool. But sometimes I felt lost regarding the assignments because the directions were very limited and very broad. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the subject mater and thought the readings were fascinating. I also really liked when we did those 'experiments' in class (Prisoner's dilemma and Public Goods problem)\r\n\r\nI thought the presentation of the material could be improved. The slide presentation was often a repetition of the reading. Perhaps instead, it could be a seminar style class that involved discussions about the materials. More student engagement would have made the class more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The content and readings are interesting, but the lectures don't really go further than the readings (so become more like a recap rather than delving deeper into the topic) and the assignments are not very challenging intellectually so I don't feel like I'm learning much while doing it, nor is there any feedback to be given. But while the work is easy, grading is hard because e.g. the final is out of 10 but accounts for 30% of the final grade, so missing just one point or two means going down a grade, and doesn't differentiate between students that really understand the concepts and those that just hit the key words or copy from the slides. ",
            "\u00a0The ya and professor was very quick to answer questions \r\n\r\nAnd he made the course easy to understand ",
            "\u00a0Probably one of the best structured courses I've taken in my 3 years at Yale, and Professor Queralt does a fantastic job organizing lectures to keep them interesting and well paced. Greatest weakness I would say are the take home assignments. The assignments themselves are fun and I had a wonderful time working them out, but the grading felt a tad harsh on most, especially when the first assignment came with a low amount of signaling as to what was desired from answers. By the time the final assignment rolled around, everyone had figured out how to write for the assignments, and Professor Queralt's questions/formatting became much clearer; however, the grading for each question still remained pointlessly hard. While I understand that this is an intro course and thus seeks to make sure students understand all the vocabulary and concepts, grading questions based on the amount of terms used feels like an inadequate to gauge understanding. I would say that I had a rather high understanding of the course material going into the class having taken the intro econ sequence, game theory, and some classes on Europe. However if anything this prior knowledge hurt me with the take home assignments as I would focus on more advanced topics and ideas rather than mention the basic assumptions. Main example of this for me was losing 10% on the final assignment (3% of final grade) because I failed to specifically mention environmental protection as a public good (even though i discussed it as a collective action issue, which is the genre of game that public goods fall into). Also the participation portion of the grading felt a little bit unfair as it was about a 40 kid lecture. While Professor Queralt increased chances for participation later in the semester, I felt the bar for adequate participation was set too high for the class size. If there was a section this might help improve this complaint; however, as it stands this portion of the grade also needs some reworking.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Professor Queralt does a great job structuring the class, and actively improved the course as the semester progressed, however the grading was at times frustrating as a result of its focus on terms rather than comprehension. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, though I would recommend having an economics prerequisite or having participation count more. It's unfair to not only the students who are engaged and want to learn, but also the professor and the TA who have spent a lot of time and energy making the class as engaging and amazing as it was, just to be met with an empty classroom. Professor Queralt and Paul (our TA) were spectacular, and it's really unfortunate that discussions were not as engaging as they could have, and not for lack of trying either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this class because it discusses a lot of important and interesting topics in political economy. I think it is a must-take for any political science major! Since this was a new course, the pace of the class and the difficulty of assignments were sometimes off, as in we moved too quickly sometimes and too slowly other times. And the grading of the assignments was not always too clear. But I think these will be improved in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really enjoyed learning about how the IPE approach can be used to analyze many of the problems today's world faces. ",
            "\u00a0No, TA did not help and the teacher was very confusing and unorganized. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly would recommend this course to another student, particularly one interested in understanding how economics and markets are political and how much politics is influenced by economic preferences! This course was well structured and interesting, and I definitely felt like I learned a lot. The assignments really helped to solidify my knowledge and integrate everything that had been said in class discussions and in the lecture notes and readings. You could tell that Professor Queralt was very focused on making sure that we learned all the material well, and didnt forget earlier concepts. Really a great class! ",
            "\u00a0It depends. Although the material was interesting, class itself often wasn't very engaging. I think if the material were re-worked it would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely . If you want to understand how the world works this is the course to start with ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. Just be wary of the participation grade and make sure you meet with the TA as often as you can when the assignments are circulated to make sure you understand what is wanted for each question. "
