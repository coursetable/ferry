I can now see the forest as a progressive community of plants, moving through time and space. For me, this class elucidated the science of forestry. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive overview of basic forest processes, discussion of how these differ by climate and latitude, basic tree physiology and breakdown of fundamental differences between gymnosperms and angiosperms, questioning my blind acceptance of paradigm that trees sequester carbon, philosophical discussions about value of wilderness/old growth.  Also strong course community, and really enjoyable trip to Great Mountain. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, reasonably clear expectations and material, fun and informative field trip\r\nWeaknesses: some stumbles with organization (totally understood that this is a transitional year for the course), less coherence of information post-midterm. But the biggest, most consistent weakness was probably the discussion portion of the course, which I think doesn't fit the course material and structure well. I could see some other participatory segment with a different approach working well instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covey is the best field lecturer out there. He also has a great sense of humor, and he was making a solid effort to keep the course informative, engaging, and relevant for students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus and course organization. We had things moving around every which way such that it was impossible to tell what was going to happen in the course. Covey tended to get waylaid with tangential discussions during lecture. Also, the discussion sections were occasionally really interesting but usually not. I think that the conceptual readings were more interesting then the dense scientific papers. I really liked when Covey explained why the papers were important to the field. With practice and more work, I think the course will be more coherent in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The classes and lectures were good, but the class was really unorganized throughout the semester. The syllabus changed no fewer than four times along with deliverables and field trip dates. I'm not sure why this was the case, but moving forward the class really need to have a bit more structure as I felt always unsure of what was due when and for what reason. The final exam was a perfect example - half of the class - including the TA - was unclear where the exam was taking place. A simple email, rather than an off-hand comment in class, would go a long way in providing the structure the course needs. ",
            "\u00a0Kris' entusiasm and expertise made this class both informative and inspiring for me. The trip to Great Mountain was a highlight. I found being in the field extremely helpful in finally understanding the concepts we learned in the classroom. In future years, I would recommend going on more field trips and making the field component of the education a priority as I think it is hard to replicate in the classroom. The main weakness of this course was the organization at times. The course is ambitious in the topics that it covers, which is good, but sometimes as we jumped from one topic to another with dense research papers, I felt like I was losing the \"forest through the trees,\" so to speak. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches core material that is essential to any student interested in a career in forestry. I would recommend spending more time covering the various phases of stand dynamics, and less time teaching students about the aforementioned topics that are tangentially related to stand dynamics, but are interesting nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n-Interesting content\r\n-The great mountain field trip was exceptional\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Structure of the course\r\n-Lecture slides\r\n-Assignments ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that it conveys numerous topics that involve and implicate stand dynamics beyond the traditional teaching of this course. For future forest managers, this information is vital to decisionmaking, and discussing how to balance competing forest uses with potential landscape (global?) scale environmental impacts was a significant strength of the course.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course could benefit from some additional organization. If BVOCs, Albedo, and GHGs are going to be included in the course going forward (as they should), it may be worth moving these lectures up to when tree physiology is discussed in the beginning of the class. Then, lectures can incorporate these aspects when appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: humor, discussion, GMF trip, methane lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: It seems like we were working hard to complicate the 4 stanges of stand development which served little purpose.  I don't think there needed to be 5 lectures for that.  Its simple: Initiation- open growing space; exclusion- growing space is filled- competition induced mortality; understory reinitiation- holes in canopy (caused by a non-catastrophic disturbance) that cannot be assumed by existing canopy filled by new cohort; old-growth-  new cohort.  And then of course mentions of structure/biodiversity/etc.  I think also, the difference between catastrophic disturbance (sets stand back to initiation) vs non-catastrophic (i.e. gap dynamics) needs to be stresses, and the definition of \"stand\" needs to be stressed as relative.  The definition of stand is so broad it seems to hold zero objective meaning. ",
            "\u00a0I recognize that this is a difficult class to teach, but it felt very scattered and disjointed. It was often hard to conceptualize the material, and maybe some things would have been better in a different order. It also would have been helpful to have more time in the field; I thought our trip to Great Mountain was one of the best parts of the class in terms of actually seeing and visualizing what we'd been talking about. We often did not do enough to connect the readings with the lecture material, and the lectures themselves sometimes felt lacking in detail. ",
            "\u00a0The focus on Oliver's four stages of forest development is essential and was well executed in this course.  Likewise with old growth issues.  The weaknesses are plentiful.  The course was horribly organized: assignments were never clear and constantly changed, lectures (other than the four stages of stand development) came out of nowhere and rarely had any relation to each other or the course, and the discussions were impossible to prepare for and never made much sense.  The lack of structure and clarity throughout the semester made this course impossible to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Too many papers to be effectively discussed in the allotted times; very theoretical and not a lot of applications/case studies discussed ",
            "\u00a0The class jumped in to a lot of advanced and difficult topics quickly and not very methodically, and then jumped around between topics quickly. I was very confused for much of the course. I think this class should be a lot more elementary in nature, and really cover the basics of forest dynamics before jumping into \"exciting\" or philosophical topics. \r\nI wish this class had a more frequent lab component, so that we could see what were talking about in real life. I also think that \"discussions\" should be eliminated from the syllabus, or at least relegated to one discussion for the whole semester, since none of us knew what we were talking about and just BS-ed our way through the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were an obvious weak point and could clearly be improved upon if the professor spent more time preparing them.  This point was made very clear when comparing Covey's lectures against lecture slides from the previous year--especially because students who did well on the midterm were the ones who had access to these slides. ",
            "\u00a0It is an interesting survey course for anyone who is planning to become acquainted with how forests work. \r\n\r\nA better organization and curation of readings and lecture slides could be greatly helpful to make this class accessible to any student  without forestry background. The reading load is little too much given the class meets twice a week. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like we stayed mostly on track with the material, but definitely lacked a bit on the field trip and pset side of things.  The one pset we did I found immensely helpful for applying the information, and I think I would have benefited from two or three more psets of similar length and demand, so as to process the information.  \r\n\r\nI wasn't able to go on the overnight field trip, and I felt that since the other trips didn't work out, I was missing some of that crucial field application.  Some better coordination on that front would've been nice.  \r\n\r\nThe main thing that I want to say here is that this was actually one of my favorite courses I've ever taken, not necessarily because of the information itself, but because of the volume of information.  I so often feel that classes have so much material to offer that I just cram and cram for the sake of the course and grade; this class had arguably less volume of material than some others, but it allowed me to really learn and understand it and feel fulfilled in the end.  And I don't necessarily mean to say that there was simply less material, but rather a healthy balance between the broader topics and their details that made everything into a more coherent whole than I've experienced elsewhere.  The presentation style and the grouping of the readings/discussions really worked for me. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the students. I felt as though I learned a lot just by engaging with them in private study groups. \r\n\r\nThe heavy focus/ reliance on Chad's book was a weakness. I would have like to have learned the course from a practitioners experience. I wanted to learn some hard skills like: in quantifying timber in stands, or how to inventory. This felt glazed over. The course felt more like trees 101 rather than stand dynamics. \r\n\r\nI think the lecture slides could be improved:\r\n\r\n- Less random imagery\r\n- Reference links / citations \r\n\r\nWhen I went to use the slides to study, I realized just how many were just odd pictures used a lecture props. They were not helpful. I think the lecturer failed to recognize the importance of informational slides from the student's perspective. Rather, they felt more like prompts that support a lecture from a  keynote speaker or something. Visual reminders to say stuff. \r\n\r\nThe TA was not integral to the course. She was very quiet, didn't share much. She held two study sessions for the final that were completely unstructured and useless. It would be great to have leveraged her experience and knowledge more. When she did speak, she seemed to know a lot. But, she rarely engaged with the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were a basic understanding of the principles of stand dynamics.  Weaknesses were the lack of field work and pointed linear progression of the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the material covered and my interest in learning these topics. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was in the copious amounts of reading, for which it was unclear what was most relevant and important. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would say that if this is the one course you'll take on forests or trees, you may want to choose a different one. But it's a fairly good survey of forest succession and some other topics like forest carbon sequestration. Kris is an engaging professor, and while he certainly got on some folks' nerves, I value that portion of a professor's job pretty highly. He's also pretty honest about his experience and thoughts on forestry. The field trip is a lot of fun. ",

It almost felt as though this was a seminar class, but with the addition of lectures, exams, problem sets and a paper. Because of that, really think about what you need to glean from from required readings and prioritize your work accordingly. ",
