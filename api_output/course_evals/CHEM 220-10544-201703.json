The exams were very similar to posted practice exams, which made students comfortable with the format going into each test.\r\n\r\nHowever, I heard some T.As were better than others and the TA organized review sessions were kind of awkward and not as well organized. ",
            "\u00a0Ellman organized the class in a great way. I tried highlighting my notes and ended up highlighting everything. He really tells you immediately what you need to know, and it's true to the test. Although there's like one curveball per test, the material and practice tests are all very true to what you can see on an exam. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the professor's ability to teach the material in the simplest manner possible, then expand on those ideas once we have gotten the basic concept. ",
            "\u00a0Really appreciated the grading system--had anything more been assigned, it would have been too much. Professor Ellman is a phenomenal instructor who explains this (sort of dry) material very clearly. However, it did feel as if the last couple of weeks of the class accelerated through material at a rate much, much faster than earlier in the semester. Maybe that material could be moved earlier in the semester, or truncated. ",
            "\u00a0The set up of the class is great for facilitating student learning. The weakness is that the sections weren't very good. The sections could be improved with more practice problems ",
            "\u00a0Great professor and notes taken during lecture. No weaknesses other than practice is essential for understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well structured and Ellman is a good professor. It feels strange that 80% of the final exam was material covered in the last 2 weeks, especially since it's worth such a large percentage of our final grade. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the course overall. Weekly problem sets might have helped synthesize the material more, but the quizzes also did a decent job. I thought there were times where we were not sufficiently prepared for certain test questions given what we were presented in class and section. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of the class is that a large portion of the grade (45%) is what is covered during the last couple of lectures (material on which you were never assessed). In this sense, it is not very cumulative and your grade largely depends on material that I felt was rushed. The beginning of the semester (all the way through the 3rd midterm) all progressed at a good pace that allowed students to keep up, but then post Midterm #3, many reactions were introduced without much time being spent on them. This quickly became overwhelming and caused me to lose my confidence that I understood the material.\r\n\r\nI also believe the course could be improved if the answer keys were posted with more in depth explanations (especially for the multiple choice). It is often difficult to correct your mistakes and learn from assessments since very little feedback is given. ",
            "\u00a0The first 2/3 of this course were taught very clearly at a pace that made sense for student learning, but then right at the end, and exponentially during the last three or four lectures, the material picked up a ton, which was frustrating because I thought I had a good grip on things, and then they got away from me before I knew it. Professor Ellman was always incredibly organized, which helped up until the material itself became very unorganized and disjointed. I think the quizzes and midterms were fair, but the final emphasized the very end of the course and a lot of the material we had never been tested on, which in my opinion, made it so that my performance on the final didn't reflect the work I put in throughout the semester. Still, I think that the course is generally well taught, and if the last few weeks of teaching were ironed out, I wouldn't have any reservations asserting that. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the last couple weeks were very rushed. Also, I wish that we had graded psets, which would keep us more accountable and on top of our work. \r\n\r\nI loved the course overall, however. I never expected to enjoy organic chemistry. The lectures were very helpful and the tests were fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Ellman is for sure the strength of the course. He, unlike most other professors in STEM here, actually wants his students to master and enjoy the content. He doesn't try to overwhelm the student by teaching too much or too quickly. He hand writes everything on the board for every lecture, in a way that is very clear and at a nice pace. He always makes it very clear what he will be testing, and provides a good outline for reading and doing practice problems in the book. He also provides 3 (!) practice exams for all the midterms and the final, which were invaluable for studying.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no problems sets, which sounds like a weird thing to complain about, but I think the course could really benefit from them. Orgo is something you really only understand and master by doing, and it can be hard sometimes to get that practice at the level expected for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Ellman is a great lecturer, and the course itself was super interesting. It was A LOT better than Gen Chem, and a lot more interesting. It's great that there are quizzes that keep you on track. The midterms and quizzes aren't super stressful too, because on of them can be dropped. All around organized really well; Ellman really knows what he's doing. ",
            "\u00a0Ellman is a very strong professor. One of the best I have had in three years at yale. Clear presentation of material and very fair assessment. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that course material can be more evenly redistributed throughout the semester. We learned about 20 new reactions and mechanisms in the last 3 weeks of class, whereas we only did a few in September and October. I understand this is because we were learning the things necessary for exploring future reactions, but perhaps a slight redistribution would make finals period less intense for students. ",
            "\u00a0Its just a lot of material in a pretty short amount of time. The course goes by very fast so do your best not to fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0In order to succeed in this class you have to really understand the information, you can't just memorize it which is really good. However, I would have preferred more of the smartwork stuff like in general chemistry so you can see how you're doing and have more practice. Giving us problems out of the book is good but it is a lot of responsibility for the students. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the pace of the course at the beginning. However, it got a little bit overwhelming in the final couple of weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were clear and easy to follow and the quiz/midterm format was helpful in staying on top of the material. One weakness is that the pacing was slightly uneven; the end of the course from the third midterm to the final contained a lot of material that may have been better introduced earlier. Graded homework assignments would have also been helpful in keeping students accountable and on time with the material (with more of a buffer than the short quizzes) while also helping students by putting more grades in the system. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: This is how a STEM course should be taught. No bullshit lectures that give you exactly the information you need. Optional homework problems where doing them only benefits your understanding but allows you to get to them when you have time. Lots of practice exams that give you an exact feel for how the exams will be and give you an opportunity to truly assess your conceptualization of the topics. Overall a 10/10 course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There could be better posting of the grades... It was a bit annoying to have to go through the secondary step of the TA's. ",
            "\u00a0It was SO SO WELL ORGANIZED. VERY conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ellman was excellent at explaining all concepts. The structure of lectures was good, however I would like to see a bit more interaction. Additionally, I would like to see students held more accountable for our homework, such as with online quizzes etc. I believe that would help students stay on top of their work and understand concepts a bit better. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very clearly taught and paced well enough that it was easy to follow. It was organized very well. The one weakness is we learned a lot in the last two weeks and the exam was largely on that material and I wish they had spread that out more. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this class. Definitely my favorite course I took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well-organized. The pace really picks up the last several weeks of classes so don't fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was very very well organized. All the reading and homework assignments were relevant and helpful. Professor Ellman's lectures were very clear and straightforward, and I liked that he wrote on the chalkboard instead of using a powerpoint. It was very easy to know how to prepare for the exams because Professor Ellman gave us three full practice tests before every exam, which was a wonderful way to study the material. Of all the courses I've taken at Yale, this course was by far the best organized to facilitate student learning.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that section was pretty unstructured, so a lot of people decided to skip section because they just saw it as \"extra help\". ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the spacing of the course material was very unevenslower in the beginning and then at the end, we learned several mechanisms all at once and didnt take the time to learn the differences and similarities. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I thought Ellman was a great Professor. Everything was well explained and the pace in class was appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! I hope it never changes ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Ellman is a very effective lecturer. He is so clear and organized. He is honestly the best STEM professor I have had at Yale, and I would be surprised if there was anyone better than him. However, I think the class could benefit from having graded problem sets, although this might be too much work for the TFs. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't find lecture particularly helpful. Also, if the course could be weighted less toward the final exam that would reduce the stress level. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this course was amazing. I felt that the practice tests and assigned problems really prepared me well for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was incredibly organized, so his lecture notes were always helpful. Hes also incredibly engaging, so going to his lectures was always a pleasure (despite the 9:25 time!) \r\n\r\nI think we spent most of the class just learning about organic chemistry with very little context. The professor occasionally mentioned applications of specific synthesis reactions, especially in medicine, but I wish there was more of that stuff. I also think that a lot of the assigned problems were actually irrelevant to the course. There was a huge number of practice problems available, and its good to have the extra practice, but most of the questions were a lot harder than what we were expected to know for the exams. I feel like I spent a lot of time working on the problems, and I got to the exam and really felt like doing the problems wasnt exactly a good use of my time. ",
            "\u00a0Ellman is a great teacher, the course teaches a lot of intuition, which is beneficial to any potential chemists. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot of organic chemistry topics in a short amount of time. My biggest issue with the course was that the material near the end of the semester was so unbelievably rushed and difficult to understand, and then our final exam was almost entirely on topics taught in the last week and a half of class.

In the beginning we spent a lot of time on the basics, which was important to build a strong foundation so that near the end when we were learning mechanisms all of it was fathomable. Near the end though, it did become a little difficult as there were so many mechanisms to memorize, but I don't think it could have been done any other way. Overall great course. ",

The last two weeks did feel very crammed, as we learned a lot more reactions than in the entire rest of the semester. Spacing it out would have helped me better digest material and prepare for the exam. Also, having the entire class grade based only on exam scores was a little nerve-wracking, and while it doesn't have to be changed, I think that adding more homework scores would have helped people feel more confident about their work in the class.

I think this especially helps when we are learning a difficult topic. Another strength of this course is that there are no mandatory psets, so students are free to spend more or less time on this class as their schedule allows. I think a weakness of this course is its overall pacingin the last week, we learned about fifteen to twenty different reactions that we were expecting to know fully for the final exam. On the other hand, the first two weeks of the class were a bit slow (although this was appreciated, adjusting to a new semester). I think slightly modifying the pacing of the class so the last few days were a bit slower would be better. ",

            "\u00a0I think that if a student needs to take organic chemistry, this is the class for them. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this semester of orgo was very well taught and well organized. I was just taking it for fun, I'm not premed and its not a major requirement or anything but honestly I did learn a lot and I think it will be helpful in my research on microbial anaerobic metabolic pathways. ",
            "\u00a0You are probably taking this course because you have to. If you are deciding whether or not you want to pursue an area of study involving taking orgo or not, I wouldn't let this class deter you. It's not as bad as the rep it gets. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- very organized and rewards those who study ",
            "\u00a0Yes, please take it. Ellman was an amazing professor. The content is really well taught. Be warned: the tests get consecutively harder and don't let the grading fool you. Even though the class is on a heavy curve, you really need to study for the exams and quizzes. This is not a class you can just blow off and hope to do well. The final is one of the hardest tests I've taken here at Yale. You need to be organized and on top of things to do well in this course, but, otherwise, you will turn out fine. ",
            "\u00a0Good and necessary for building organic chemistry foundation ",
            "\u00a0If you have taken gen chem, might as well take orgo! It's actually a lot of fun. A lot of people hear nightmare stories about orgo (especially at other schools), but CHEM 220 is very very well taught. The competition is pretty high indeed, due to high number of premed students. But if you focus on learning the material and do the homework in a timely manner, you won't have too much of a problem.\r\n\r\nThe ability to visualize 3D structures in your head is very important for this class. If you have taken MATH 120, then you probably won't have much problem. But if you know that you have challenges in this area, then you might want to get a model and dedicate extra time. ",
            "\u00a0Ellman is a great professor for the first semester of orgothe lectures follow the textbook extremely well and the tests are fairvery similar to the practice exams. There are no problem sets so its up to you to keep up with material. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Ellman is one of the best professors I've ever had and the material learned here was pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a wonderful course to take if you are interested because it covers a good range of organic chemistry without getting too complicated. Then again, it is a requirement for most STEM and pre-meds, so I also recommend it in the sense that it is a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was well taught and it provides a basic understanding for organic chemistry. It's also very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like thinking about chemistry and reaction patterns. Not a gut. Not for humanities students. If you're pre-med, there's no choice really, so good luck! ",

            "\u00a0You probably have to take this class, and Ellman is very solid and clear. However, it will be challenging at the end and I felt I had to learn a lot of material independently. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the material. Professor Ellman is great, and the class is quite doable in terms of workload and in following the material. ",
            "\u00a0This is a FANTASTIC organic chemistry class. Prof Ellman is an amazing lecturer, by far the best teacher out of all of the STEM lectures that I've taken at Yale. The lecture are clear and make a lot of sense, and the readings are extremely helpful at solidifying understanding (though probably not necessary to do well in the class). The class is structured so there are no psets due, but the optional practice problems are extremely helpful and I would absolutely recommend doing them before exams. The quizzes and exams are reasonable, and Ellman always gives us practice exams in advance. Section can also be very helpful, depending on your TF. As long as you keep up with the material you will get a lot out of and do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0if you have to take it, yes. However, it is a challenging class with a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Prof. Ellman is fantastic, and really cares about his students. The class overall did not feel too daunting, especially considering that the reputation of organic chemistry precedes it. The material was challenging but generally doable. I would recommend doing the assigned problems, even though they are not turned it, because it helps you stay on top of the lecture material. I would also recommend not skipping class, especially for the last two weeks, when a good amount of material is packed in. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have to otherwise hell no. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Ellman is an amazing professor and made learning organic chemistry very enjoyable. The practice exams were very helpful in studying for the midterms and finals. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to others if they have to take it. The professor was really nice and helpful. However, the material was very difficult and at times very hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0100% If you are going to take organic chemistry TAKE THIS CLASS. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. If you are taking this, it is probably for your major anyway, but I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class is definitely one of the more tolerable pre-med req courses or pre-req stem major courses. It went much better than expected and was manageable through out most of the semester and only got really bad towards the end. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this course is very well taught and you learn a lot. The grading and exams are very fair and you never feel blindsided. Absolutely take this course with Ellman. He's such a good lecturer and easy to understand. Keep up with the book problems! I didn't do this and I wish I had; I think it really negatively impacted my final grade. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student, because it is an important class to take, particularly for those going into the life sciences. You will develop many important skills necessary for those disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you need to take it, it is quite rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0yes because it provides a good base in organic chemistry ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take it or anyone who is really interested in organic chemistry. Definitely try to take it with Professor Ellman. ",
            "\u00a0There are no homework grades, but keep in mind that this means all of your grades are from assessments in the form of quizzes/exams, and these are pretty hard. Your experience will depend heavily on which TA you have, so if you feel yours isn't working out I would recommend starting to attend a different TAs section as soon as possible (or even go to more than one section). I probably would have understood the concepts better and performed better if I had done this early on instead of waiting. Professor Ellman is really great though and is very helpful in his office hours and right after class if you have concerns or trouble with concepts. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, take it. if you don't, I do not think there is a clear enough connection between theory and praxis for this course to be of any use. It is clearly an intermediary. ",

            "\u00a0This course was very well structured and organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in chemistry and organic chemistry. It is very organized, clear, and well-taught, which makes some very difficult concepts seem relatively simple to understand. But be prepared to do a lot of problems and have the self-discipline to study something multiple times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes to those interested in organic chemistry ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was interesting and the professor was really good, but most people take this class because they have to. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course would be great for a student with some prior knowledge of the material, as trying to learn everything from scratch was very time-consuming and made it difficult to keep up with the pace of the class. Also, there is a lot of information that must be memorized, and I personally would have enjoyed learning a lot more about the logics and applications of such information instead of just having to memorize reactions.
