            "\u00a0I learned both to better understand the core doctrine and rules of traditional environmental law, and to think about what \"environmental law\" is expansively and imaginatively.  The focus on imagination -- on seeing beyond traditional boundaries to find tools and new ideas that could help people, animals and the environment upon which they both depend -- left a big impact on me, and I'm grateful for it.  Through the two streamlining exercises, I also learned about how to legal opinions and public comments powerfully and concisely. ",
            "\u00a0I have a broad overview of all the landmark environmental law acts and its historical developments since the 1970s. I learned how administrative and constitutional law applied to some of these statutes. It was insightful to have guests present on environmental law in practice and how it has developed in areas where our course instructors were not experts in. ",
            "\u00a0Great writing skills, critical thinking skills , problem-solving skills and in depth knowledge about environmental law. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how environmental law relates to other fields of the law. "

            "\u00a0I thought this course was terrific. I learned an enormous amount. The knowledge, skills and insights I gained in the class met and exceeded my  expectations. I was repeatedly awed by the clarity, thoughtfulness, excellence and eloquence evident in Eugene's lectures. (They were seriously special -- what a pleasure to listen to.) I was likewise repeatedly impressed by Conor's storytelling, commitment to the real people that \"environmental law\" impacts, and the wide scope of his knowledge about topics like zoning, etc., and how they were connected to environmental law. ",
            "\u00a0The class met my expectations in engaging the main issues of environmental law. ",
            "\u00a0Far exceeded my expectation. It was my best class at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Fairly well. "

            "\u00a0I thought this course was wonderful. I feel very lucky and grateful to have been a part of it. Without question, I think the course's greatest strength was its teachers: Doug Kysar, Eugene Rusyn, and Conor Dwyer Reynolds. All three embody the phrase \"excellence with a heart.\" They combine intellectual rigor with compassion, humor and seriousness of purpose in every class and interaction.  I look forward to someday saying \"I was one of their first students\" when Eugene and Conor are off being VIP law professors or winning a Pulitzer or being the next Werner Herzog. \r\n\r\nMaya Angelou has that famous line, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" And surely this is true for teachers too. Over time I'm sure I'll forget most of the content we learned in class, but I won't forget the three of them, how the class felt or the most important point that was delivered -- as Eugene said so beautifully at the end of the semester -- about how to work to link the limits of our understanding with the limitlessness of our moral imagination. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the group work and final project, though I felt like my contributions to the class minimized as a result of the lack of independence within the firm structure. It was very easy to allow the more outspoken group members to take the lead on class discussions. There could have been more time for class discussion, rather than having 1.5h or more of lectures. Even when I came prepared to discuss the assigned readings, I felt there was little time to raise additional questions or thoughts.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the effort that Conor and Eugene put into the lectures throughout the semester. It was easier to follow their lectures after they used visual aids like powerpoint slides. They are both very knowledgeable and they made conscientious efforts to make a conducive space for challenging conventional environmental law. However, I felt that the teaching team sometimes did not adhere to the norms that we set out in class, which disappointed me considering how we spent nearly three sessions thinking up class norms. \r\n\r\nOn the actual class content itself, I felt like there should have been a greater focus on substantive case law and unpacking the statutes in greater detail. I felt like I did not come out with the knowledge that would allow me to advise on environmental law issues in practice. While I appreciated that we were encouraged to think of ourselves as unconventional environmental lawyers, I still think that we had to ground our expectations and learning in having a practical impact in today's context. ",
            "\u00a0There was many great stuff to be learned within a short span of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: carefully crafted and well thought out reading materials; thoroughly researched lectures\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were informative but not clearly organized making it hard to follow the train of logic throughout the presentation (maybe a basic thematic outline for each class period could help with this); the promise of student participation/discussion dissipated after the first week. (10 minutes of student input/questions at the end of an hour and a half lecture is not discussion.) "

            "\u00a0Take this course!!!!!!!!! This course was wonderful. A truly special experience. I feel very lucky and grateful to have been part of it and learned a ton. I would highly recommend it to any student. I think the course's greatest strength was its teachers: Doug Kysar, Eugene Rusyn, and Conor Dwyer Reynolds. All three were excellent and inspiring. It was a gift to be part of every week. ",
            "\u00a0This is a bird's eye view of domestic environmental law. The readings are interesting and engaging, so you should do them in full. If you like group work and legal writing, this is also an effective class to help improve these skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would surely recommend taking this class. The professors are awesome! "
