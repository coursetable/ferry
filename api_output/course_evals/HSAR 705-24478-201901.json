            "\u00a0I got an opportunity to practice archival work, and to read and respond to my colleagues' writing. ",
            "\u00a0I came into the course expecting somehow that studying the landscape of the American West would help inform my study of landscapes elsewhere, but I don't necessarily know if the knowledge is transferable. I certainly think that texts like Barthes on Myth, Solnit on the wilderness, the many different texts we had on the meaning and manipulations of mapping will all be something that I carry with me out of the class. The same can be said for the problematic of the \"visual document,\" which seems to be a historiographical problem to me now, at least from the standpoint of American Studies (i.e. it's hard enough to get historians to take artistic material seriously; this approach is intended as a sop to them, and c.). \r\n\r\nI think there were some singular conversations that also emerged quite naturally, and it's to Jenny's credit that they unfolded as they did. I'm thinking in particular about a wide-ranging skirmish over the 2017 Whitney Biennial as regarded the depiction of violent or traumatic or racist images, and whether such pictures should continue to be worked over or let to die a certain death in an era of mass shootings and mainstream hatred. You could feel that there was a camp of advocates in the room who were almost ready to come down on the side of benevolently woke censorship. Taking the Coco Fucso position of asking instead \"what lives should these pictures lead\" as opposed to \"what pictures ought to be left to die,\" was decisive for me a scholar--as I had just encountered the heinous images of \"The Searchers\" the night before and was all too ready to consign John Wayne to the dustbin of history.\r\n\r\nThis debate led me into a deeper consideration of how to think about a \"military history of art.\" The moral and ethical problems are manifold. How does one talk about combat experiences having never served? How do you keep a paper from turning into anti-war screed that would be unpalatable to a real veteran? How do you capture the subjectivity of the opposing force? How do you perform the wonkish, fetishistic registers of military history proper so as to appear legitimate to those scholars, yet retain the theorecticism expected of a present-day historian of art?\r\n\r\nIndeed, this will be the third seminar paper I've now written at Yale dealing in some way about the post-Napoleonic warfare of the Industrial Revolution (e.g. 19th century Russia, Britain, and now America). It's making me seriously reconsider my intended dissertation direction, as Tim Barringer has noted that while I could very easily produce an institutional history of a traveling exhibiting society of Russian painters, there's something entirely unique about my approach to this particular subject matter. When you think about how so many scholars struggle to find the slimmest visual interest in pictures of violencewhen their eyes fog over at the first sight of a shakotheres something to be said about being the very model of a modern military art historian, who in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan has the iconographic facility to tell the difference from a mamelon and a ravelin. And then, of course, to make it somehow matter: to arrive at the vaunted \"So what?\" of this content. ",
            "\u00a0I gained incredible knowledge of the history and visual culture of the American West, and was introduced to useful theoretical entry points into this complicated material. The course's emphasis on writing was incredibly useful, and helped me understand how to develop an argument based on archival material. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a period of American history that I had extremely little familiarity with. I learned about the major intellectual themes of the American west, and gained familiarity with its art as well as the archives representing this region in the Beinecke library  invaluable! ",
            "\u00a0This class was an incredible opportunity to delve deeply into archival methods and materials. I really developed my ability to look closely at materials and think about constructing arguments based largely on primary source materials. I also gained deeper insight into the mythology of the American West and how it continues to impact our socio-political situation to this day. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic for honing visual analysis; our time in the Beinecke familiarized us with a diverse range of materials that we had to analyze and synthesize quickly. I think my visual literacy and identification of different printing techniques improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me become more comfortable with working with archival materials and with the Beinecke in particular, and I developed a better understanding of the ways visual materials have served to promote and shape ideas about the American West. ",
            "\u00a0Broad understanding of the role of art and visual culture in the history of the American West, learned how to do research in the Beinecke, craft an argument and research project from an archival/art object. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the creative, hands-on structure of the course. Working with objects from the Beinecke-- in nearly every session-- was a unique and valuable experience. Jenny's generosity with her time, in scheduling peer-review workshops and reading many stages of seminar paper drafts, likewise was singular in my graduate experience thus far. My ability to look closely at objects, and then to turn these reflections into a cogent, concise, and persuasive paper, has improved significantly. ",
            "\u00a0Archival and research skills, working with primary materials "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The far-ranging thematic approach and the archival depth of this course were incredible, but a greater emphasis on the literature of settler-colonialism and more opportunities to discuss the research and writing process during the course, given its research-seminar focus, might have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0Jenny's commitment to object-based inquiry cannot be overstated. Every class but the first was conducted either at the Yale University Art Gallery or the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her mobilization of such a huge corpus of campus collections is a singular feat of pedagogy and course planning pragmatics and, I think, is inspired from a philosophical perspective, even: insofar as she's insistent on making these objects see the light of day instead of sitting in storage for decades at a time.\r\n\r\nI think the major weaknesses of the course are all in its treatment of the final paper. To borrow from the illustrious Bob Dylan, I prefer to know my song well before I start singing. Demanding a substantial 5-7 page proposal before most of the students have had a chance to read their bibliographies (i.e., before spring break) means that they have to start staking claims before they've really had the time to sit with an idea and mull it over. \r\n\r\nWhile I think I submitted a perfectly serviceable final draft, I'd probably write an entirely different paper. (E.g. going from a comparison of two images with similar subject matter, to a more distant reading that attempted to visually sketch the dramatic structures of two larger print portfolios and connect them to the artists' other projects). Research truly is an iceberg, insofar as the 90% of the reading and looking accomplished over the course of the term remains below the waterline. What I thought was important before midterm was not what was important at the beginning of reading period.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the major second weakness: the fact this paper was due before exam period had even begun. I don't usually run out the clock on my deadlines, but I found myself sitting on this paper until the morning of May 3rd to make sure I could proofread it in a lucid state of mind. (I.e., beyond the fog of that cognitive saturation point, where you begin to skip over pronouns and such). Again, while I turned the paper in on time, I still think I could have \"sat with it\" for a longer period of time and made something more polished. This might be the refrain, then, for this central weakness at both the macro-level of argument-design and the micro-scale of editing. \"Sitting with something,\" going back to the drawing board, rethinking the paper was not really possible because of the kind of \"continuity\" demanded by the multiple, recurring deadlines. \r\n\r\n(\"Just give me an archive, a single 30 minute chunk of office hours, and ten weeks and I'll get back to you,\" maybe? This course reinvented the wheel, as regards how to write a seminar paper? With regards to that former point: I think all the apparatus built up around the paper writing process actually kept me from thinking I ever needed to talk to Jenny. I received our use of George Miles to be a way of distributing the advising burden for a fully subscribed seminar between two interlocutors, so felt that an initial consult with him was substitute enough. I think this was a mistake, in retrospect.)\r\n\r\nSmaller weaknesses include the \"viewing sessions\" before seminar. I never made use of them, and simply came to seminar 15 minutes early after doing research earlier that morning. The peer review session was also of limited utility: the room where we convened was too noisy to think straight and I didn't feel any of us had much to say about the others' papers. I mostly just revised my introduction and cut down the number of \"things\" my objects allegedly \"did\" over the course of the paper's argument in response to peer critiques. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thoughtfully designed. Interaction with the Beinecke collections and with curator George Miles was especially notable. It made the course both unusual and extremely engaging. The only weakness for me is that I wished we had more time in some of the sessions to look at the fascinating materials and to continue talking about them. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were access to materials at the Bienecke, the incredible knowledge of George Miles, Dr. Raab's fantastic feedback and discussion facilitation, and the opportunity to do peer editing at multiple stages. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I perceived from this course was that it would have been nice to get into our smaller peer-editing groups earlier in the process and potentially share our research and proposals with the smaller group in order to get better and more specific feedback from the very beginning. Otherwise, it was an absolutely incredible class and process. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- fantastic readings; great themes for each section with objects at the Beinecke that were either directly or closely related; active discussion and participation; great moderation by professor and George Miles\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed having class meetings at the Beinecke and YUAG and interacting with primary sources. It was also useful to have multiple check-ins about our research. The check-ins helped me feel more accountable for keeping up with my own research throughout the semester, and I became more familiar with other students' projects than I normally do in courses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Being able to work with so many amazing archival materials from the Beinecke was great, and was enhanced by the assigned readings. Super engaged group of students and interesting discussions \r\nWeaknesses: While I enjoyed the Beinecke class sessions, sometimes it felt like too much to look at to really have time to appreciate everything. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been slightly more time for discussion of the texts, and perhaps slightly more of an opportunity to sit during class (it is hard to stand for two hours). During one or two sessions we had discussion of the texts for 30 min at the beginning or end of class, before or after turning to objects, and I found that productive. ",
            "\u00a0Pro: close link with the Beinecke and its primary sources\r\nCon: materials outside of Beinecke became peripheral\r\nA balance between materials should be maintained "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It was a great opportunity to spend time with a fascinating trove of materials in the Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0I think having noticed the relative reluctance of the present first-year cohort to engage in close visual analysis, Id recommend this course to them. While I wont go so far as to condemn them as have some of my colleagues (e.g., with exasperation: They dont know how to look!), the close contact with objects in each and every session ultimately forces people to start saying what they see. Students in Jennys seminar cannot hide behind their laptop screens and retain their identities as arguably intellectually blackmailed, over-theoreticized scholars. Theyve got to start thinking about pragmatics: the keying up of different chromolithographic plates, the idiosyncrasies of hand-coloring, the presence or absence of colophons and original wrappers, and c. Its a primer for a more material history of art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. If the material is of interest, of even if it is not, it is an excellent course for thinking through questions of imperialism, colonialism, conquest, and image-making. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student, as I think it offers the rare opportunity to work closely with primary source materials throughout the semester and to also gain active feedback on your paper writing process from the very beginning through to the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course. It's such a special opportunity to use primary sources from the Beinecke every single week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class discussion was great, and the class structure was helpful for guiding my research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great opportunity to engage in original research and spend time deeply engaged in a topic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- one of the few times I felt that I was learning how to become a careful researcher and writer. Equally a class on the American West (which engaged broad theoretical issues) and a class on the process of academic creation: archival work, reading, drafting, more drafting, and peer revising. ",
