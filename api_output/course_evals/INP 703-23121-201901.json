            "\u00a0I was able to deepen my understanding on core topics in neuroscience and how they may be translated to an understanding of the human brain. ",
            "\u00a0Preparation for the written exam for qualifying - it was helpful to have to take a large number of questions and consider answers for each but choose which to officially answer in the end. \r\n\r\nA good understanding for how systems in neuroscience are similar and also different; it was helpful to compare them with lectures from a range of neuro subfields. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a better understanding of brain circuits and how systems neuroscience approaches these circuits to understand their function in generating behavior. ",

            "\u00a0Almost every class is taught by a different lecturer, meaning that we spend a lot of the 1.5 hours on background and review information.  By the time we get to the most important material, everyone is exhausted and there is not enough time to explore in detail.  Lecturers frequently rushed through some of the most complicated concepts, leaving students feeling out of their depth.  I would recommend that each class be broken into two shorter classes to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I thought the structure of the class was wonderful and I learned a lot!  Having taken the class, I now feel like I will be able to engage with a broader scope of literature and presentations in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A range of topics covered with some helpful overlap to see the connections between classes. Dr. Arnsten did a beautiful job of reminding us how topics between lectures were related.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was stressful to go straight to our first-year bioethics course on the days that we had clinical discussions. If possible to have more time then before class, that would have been good just for those days! ",
            "\u00a0The number of individual lecturers and topics were both a strength and a weakness. Spending different lectures on disparate topics within systems neuroscience broadened my horizons but also meant that I was left wanting after certain lectures. Nonetheless, I really loved the format and highly suggest that it be continued as such. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was fairly contiguous considering the number of faculty teaching and overall the faculty seemed well prepared to stick to their prescribed subject matter. Clearly the non-human primate research was extremely well taught and represented. For me, I would have liked to see more rodent or invertebrate lectures than there were, but I know a lot depends on faculty availability. Another weakness, which is really nitpicking, is not really knowing before the first exam that we had to draw our own figures. Overall, though I enjoyed the class quite a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed having different lecturers every week. I thought the exams were fair and assessed accurately the material taught during the course. "

            "\u00a0Definitely.  This course dovetails nicely with the fall semester courses so that by the end of the first year, INP students feel that they have a solid handle on basic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Very well designed and organized course with important topics particularly for a first-year neuroscience student! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very good course and does what it says it does. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It provides a solid foundation that will hopefully be useful for the rest of graduate school. "
