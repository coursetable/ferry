            "\u00a0This class covered very broadly a few different relevant scientific subjects. You learn about the overlying causes and basic science of each mechanic, and are tested every three weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I not only learned about a variety of different fields in science, I went into depth in each of these fields and felt like I gained a sophisticated understanding of cool, cutting-edge concepts. I think the most meaningful thing I learned, along the way, how to read scholarly articles and distill complicated ideas and scientific jargon into more basic, yet still meaningful facts.  This course helped broaden by view of what science is and the different fields I could explore in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I feel I gained a baseline knowledge on many currently relevant scientific issues which is quite useful. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a number of 'current topics in science' in a way that allows me to be more cognizant of the world's scientific developments. ",
            "\u00a0A general understanding of many pressing scientific topics in popular culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about scientific topics such as sea ice melt and biofuels. However, most significantly, I was introduced to the expectations of Yale courses. "

        [
            "\u00a0Many of the demos are pretty cool, and the catering makes the atmosphere pretty casual and easygoing. The subjects are also very interesting and relevant. Sometimes the course seems to drag on a bit, and the exact expectations for grading and work isn't communicated amazingly. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with more concrete information posted on canvas. For example, posting all the lecture powerpoint and assignments online, and and specifics about the tests (open-book / closed-book), assignment due dates, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I rather like the setup and have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The lecturers of this course are extremely knowledgeable in their respective fields, and give good introductions to their material. Despite the class being a seminar, however, students don't really get to interact with/get to know each other. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of materials and professors is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0The course is far more lecture-style than I had anticipated, especially for a freshman seminar. I find sometimes there is very little interaction among students and between student and teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I think the casual nature of this course (meeting only once a week, relatively few exams/quizzes) helps reinforce a curiosity and interest in science, as opposed to a feeling that science is nothing more than a bunch of facts one has to memorize and be able to recite at a moment's notice. Moreover, all the subject material in this course has been fascinating and I can't wait for the next semester of it. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the subjects given and want to learn more without delving into too much math, this course is pretty good. It's easygoing and not too hard if you pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really liked this course and loved the set up of moving between topics every 3 weeks. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes science, but is not sure if they want to go into intro bio / chem. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0For someone who is interested in learning about a wide range of scientific topics, I would greatly recommend this seminar. It is important to note, however, that this course does take up an entire year--so proceed with caution in registering. ",
            "\u00a0It's great for someone who wants to see what all of the newest and most interesting things that are happening in science are, but doesn't know if they want to go into them yet. It's like a sneak peak. Also it's an easy science credit.\r\nFor anyone who's already interested in science, best skip this. ",
            "\u00a0It is an exceptional freshman seminar! ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone with even a hint of an interest in any scientific field. It's engaging, it's interesting, it doesn't require too much work, and it's the most enjoyable class I've taken at Yale. "
