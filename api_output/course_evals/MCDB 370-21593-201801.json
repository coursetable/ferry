            "\u00a0There were some areas of biology (e.g. antibodies, CRISPR, aptamers/ribozymes) that I didn't know much about going into this course, where I think I learned a fair amount. But overall, the material covered was far too broad and surface level to develop a real understanding of any particular topic, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a lotsome of the most modern techniques in the biotech field from some of the experts here at Yale. We also had great guest lecturers to teach us less about the science aspect of the field. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a little bit about a wide range of topics in biotechnology and gained a new perspective on the industry side of biotech. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a whole new set of career paths through this class, which I thought was invaluable, perhaps even more than the actual biology we learned. For many students, I think it might be hard to conceive of majoring in biology and going on to anything other than medicine or academia. But this class really opened my eyes about what I could possibly do with a biology major, whether it's going to work for big pharma, staring a drug development startup, going into patent law, etc. I know that this class requires a lot of prerequisites before students can understand the biology taught, but I wish there was some way students could take this earlier in their Yale career and realize the myriad of options open to them after graduation! It's not too late for me since I was a junior in my spring semester, so I was able to get an internship in biotech for the coming summer, but for many seniors who were in the class, they already had post-grad jobs lined up before even knowing about some of these options. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the state of the biotechnology industry, the different technologies made, and some of the business aspects of biotech. Really great class! ",
            "\u00a0MCDB 370 provides an overview of recent developments in several fields of biology, including for instance drug discovery, plant biotechnology, and Alzheimer's disease. In general, the class gives you a basic background on each topic that's covered that doesn't go into all of the details but makes you aware of the topic and the current state of research. "

            "\u00a0Strengths (?): breadth. Weaknesses: Lack of depth. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the diversity of lectures so that you learn from professors/experts that know their stuff. Weakness however was that some of the lecturers were not very engaging/unclear. In addition, expectations for the quizzes were not clear, even though it turned out to be much easier than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great cursory course on biotechnology; learn about the biology and the business\r\nWeaknesses: many of the modules are disconnected and vary in degree of detail; little information given about the quizzes before; exam questions vary in difficulty and level of detail required based on which professor wrote the question ",
            "\u00a0While it can be a positive experience to learn from several different perspectives, this class suffers from disorganization and poor communication with students. Weekly paper assignments were often posted with a day or less before section and quiz topics were never discussed in class. The responsibility for teaching was diffused and as a result the class felt disconnected and impersonal. Some of the guest lecturers were fantastic, while others were dry and seemingly pointless. The midterm exam was fair and reflected the material presented in the slides, but the final exam was rife with ambiguously worded questions and emphasized topics that were never discussed in lecture (at one point during the exam, nearly a quarter of the class was waiting to have a question answered by the proctors). This class would be best if it was taught exclusively by Craig Crews, with (more) occasional guest lectures by the other professors and visiting speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that this course really covered a range of topics, although some people complained that the rotating lecturers made the class quite disjointed. I didn't feel it was terribly disjointed, and felt that I really benefited from learning about everything from antibodies to the plant sentinel program. The content of the lectures were very engaging and interesting!\r\nThe one thing that I think could be majorly improved for this class is the quality of the exams. Because the material was so detailed and in-depth, I expected from the very beginning that our quizzes and exams would provide questions that would reflect that difficulty. But I found this was never the case, and I was frustrated that the questions were not harder and did not give me the opportunity to display the knowledge that I had learned. I felt this way for every single quiz and exam we took. For example, the second quiz of the semester followed Farren Isaacs and Ron Breaker's lectures, in which we talked in depth about DNA sequencing, editing, and synthesis, as well as other nucleic acids. I would have been prepared to answer a question on the chemical basis of DNA synthesis (detritylation, oxidation, acid wash, etc.) and studied all of the material in detail. However, I was disappointed that the question asked something I could have answered without even studying: \"What are the components of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and what is its natural function in bacteria?\" To be honest, I could have answered this question in my freshman year, and I was very frustrated that a quiz that determined 15% of our grade was a question that everybody could easily answer. There was no differentiation between students by the amount of the knowledge they had learned. This sort of basic question was reflected across all exams we took (although slightly more in quizzes than in midterm/final exams). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting, professors are really great at what they do and give really cool lectures. Selected papers are also really interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Feels a little arbitrary when it comes to grading - two 6 point quizzes worth 12.5% of our entire grade each? Question on MAGE on the final worth 10pts when we hardly covered MAGE? etc. ",
            "\u00a0The class had good lecturers -- the lectures on Alzheimer's disease, HIV, and plant biotechnology were particularly interesting -- and offers a good summary of each topic that it covers. I think I would have enjoyed the opportunity to go into more depth on a smaller number of topics, so a slower-paced class that covered less material in more detail might have been nice. "

            "\u00a0Avoid taking this course unless your strapped for an upper-level MCDB elective like I was. Since it's team taught and not centered around any one branch of biology, there's very little continuity and you don't really feel like you're progressing as you work your way through the course. You also don't spend more than two days on any one topic, so it often feels as if you're getting the pop-sci treatment of whatever area you're studying. If you're someone who relishes the details (or even understanding), this will drive you crazy. Parts of the course are just aggravating (i.e. reading responses), and section was a complete waste of time (but necessary because of a participation grade). Finally, the quality of teaching is hugely variable: you get two wonderful lectures from Ron Breaker, and then twenty-two lectures that are (in my opinion) far worse. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. You do really get a sample of all different biotech items and it could introduce you to something you may want to have a career in one day. Even if you don't want to go into biotech, if you are at all interested in the latest and greatest science it's a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The class does a good job at giving a general overview of biotechnology. Definitely take it if you're interested in the topic. However, the class has some major weaknesses. The modules are quite disjointed and varied in degree of detail, and there is no transparency regarding the quizzes and exams, so you study a lot just to answer one question on the quiz. The TA's were not helpful, and discussion sections were a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an MCDB major looking for that level 350 or above course, this one will suffice but I wouldn't seek it out. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in applications of all the courses you have taken before! Cell bio, genetics, and microbio all come together in this course and become practical fields of study, rather than just intellectual curiosities. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a phenomenal upper MCDB elective. The material is super interesting, the instructors put a lot of work into making their lectures interesting, and it's the first course which actually showed the \"applied\" side of biology. Biotech is a really cool and exploding field, and this was the most \"preprofessional\" course I've taken, which is great. ",
            "\u00a0Possibly. If you want an introduction to a number of different topics in current biology research that gives you enough information to go on and learn more for yourself, MCDB 370 will provide that. If you want a more in-depth assessment of any one topic, the class isn't structured to do that. It is well-taught but in general emphasizes quantity of material over depth. "
