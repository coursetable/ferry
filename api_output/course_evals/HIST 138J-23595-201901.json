            "\u00a0If you want to take this class, you should be pretty aware of what you're getting into. Blight may be our best professor at Yale, and the opportunity to take a seminar with him shouldn't be passed up. You'll learn. You'll read a book a week. You'll get to know Blight. It's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken a history course that has memory as its main focus, and I learned so much from this course because of that very fact. (I think all history majors should be required to take a course in memory studies). The first two weeks are very theory-heavy, and then we build on this basis for the rest of the course  this was a very smart choice by Professor Blight. I will carry what I learned about how memory interacts with history throughout all of my future history courses at Yale, and throughout the rest of my life, honestly. It is something that you start seeing everywhere you look. I feel like a gained a worldview in this class. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to write and research a LONG paper; the 25 pager is HARD, but I feel very ready for further coursework in the history major because of it, and I'm really glad that I had this experience relatively early on. ",
            "\u00a0We started off reading several theoretical works on history and memory. Throughout the course we read a wide range of texts on Civil War memorials, Holocaust memorials, including Robert Penn Warren, Baldwin, Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Young, and Tony Horwitz. We also researched for a 25-page term paper. ",
            "\u00a0A wealth of interesting perspectives about the ways in which memory is contested and appealed to in human life. The course made me ask myself challenging questions about the very nature of history and the knowability of the past. The Civil War presents a spellbinding case study, and it was fascinating to examine both how the war has resonated with different generations and how various actors have taken great pains to manipulate its memory to serve political ends. We also did one week on memory in the Native American community (centered around the Sand Creek Massacre), one week on the memory of World War I, and one week on memory of the Holocaust. Throughout the course, crucial discussions about public commemoration (e.g. Robert E Lee monuments) and the possibility of writing inclusive histories bubbled up. These are crucial questions to chew on if you're really interested in being a thoughtful historical actor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned, broadly speaking, how to study the history of memory. The course invited questions I had never asked before about what \"history\" is, how we do it, and what it can and cannot tell us. We explored both the theoretical considerations of history vs. memory, fact vs. myth, etc. as well as specific examples of problems in historical memory, such as the legacy of the civil war, the Sand Creek Massacre, and 9/11. ",
            "\u00a0We started by discussing some theoretical readings that discussed the differences and tensions between history and memory: how scholars have defined the two, how they interact, and how they may be in conflict. Then we basically read a book a week and then came to class to discuss it. We talked about a few books that were specifically focused on Civil War commemoration, often through monuments, but we also discussed books that were focused on the Holocaust, 9/11, and the Sand Creek Massacre. We even read James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates one week and contrasted their views of history and memory. Prof. Blight often led the discussion, but he was also always clearly interested in students' input, so we learned to think critically about these texts and the problems of memory that the authors were digging at. Overall, it was a really interesting class and a different way of thinking about history. ",
            "\u00a0This class changed much of what I knew about the Civil War and post-war period, and Prof. Blight connected historical memory from a variety of periods in a way that completely changed my perspective on remembrance ",
            "\u00a0I learned (through the process of writing the 25-page paper) how to research in depth in a way I had never done before. The area of memory studies was also something that I'd never explored before that this class introduced me to. ",
            "\u00a0I became a more efficient, insightful reader and writer through this course, and was introduced to methods of archival research that I had never implemented before. The course focused heavily on issues of memory and history, and provoked much thought as to how each are formed within society. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Honestly, pretty much everything. The reading list is incredible. Professor Blight is incredible. The two short papers are hard; they're short but very intellectually challenging, and I felt proud when I finished each. The 25 pager is very, very hard, but also so interesting you can write on pretty much anything related to memory and history (not even limited to the Civil War, or to the U.S.) and everyone's final topics (which we presented) were incredibly diverse and fascinating. Don't be scared off by this paper; this course is worth it, and you will learn a lot. That being said, start early!! I started research in earnest right when I got back from spring break, and still wish I had had more time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, the only thing I can think of is that there isn't usually much discussion in seminar, but I'm not really sure that's a weakness. Professor Blight has such a wealth of knowledge and STORIES that I would have hated for him to talk less, and I felt that the student presentations on each text were actually a really valuable task to have in terms of synthesizing knowledge when it was your turn to present (twice or so in a semester for most people, I think). I think a side effect of this is that the class wasn't as close-knit as it could have been, but I don't really think I would have changed that.\r\n\r\nI guess the only real weakness is that the class tended to run overby at least five minutes  it was at 230 Prospect and I was always speed-walking and not-infrequently late to my next class. If I didn't have that next class, of course, I wouldn't have cared that class went over it was usually because Blight was telling a great story. ",
            "\u00a0The course was wonderful. Professor Blight was fantastic - the readings were engaging, and discussion was interesting. Two comments I have for improvement are 1) I feel like we could had additional deadlines for our term paper  (for example an annotated bibliography or rough draft) that would have helped a lot with pacing. I felt like I did not know how to pace my research and writing process; 2) 20% of the grade in this class is participation but sometimes I felt like it was hard to contribute substantially except for through the presentations on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course, without question, is Professor Blight. He is a world-class historian and a kind and compassionate man. Even amidst the cattle call of book prizes he was awarded this term, he never failed to make time for all of his students whenever they wanted his advice or help on course assignments, and during those appointments, he makes you feel as if you're the only person in the world to him. He is a born-and-bred educator, and truly cares about each one of his students. Having had the opportunity to learn from him ranks among the great pleasures and honors of my Yale career. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement would be to shorten the student presentations each class. For every book, a student gave a \"summary\" at the beginning of class. However, these often morphed into 30-60 minute presentations which, though often exceedingly well done, sometimes precluded more dynamic class discussions. Perhaps clearer expectations could be set on how thorough those presentations need to be. It is, after all, hard to summarize a 300-page book, especially when David Blight is in the audience! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the reading list, the professor, and the high level of engagement among students in the seminar. The only weakness/room for improvement concerns the weekly reading presentations: there should be more guidelines on what to present to limit them in terms of time and make them more about leading a discussion than summarizing the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Blight is a huge strength! He's a fantastic historian and literally won a Pulitzer Prize in the middle of the semester, but he's super humble and eager to engage with his students. I also really liked the process of writing a long research paper for this course, and it was helpful and fun to talk with Prof. Blight about directions for the paper and books that I could look at to help with my research. For me, the final paper felt like a strength of the course, because I really got to dive into a topic that I was interested in. In the process of writing the paper, I feel like I learned a lot about the period of history that I was writing about that I had never known before, and writing something more than 25 pages helped me improve my writing. It really helps to start as early as possible--try to pick a topic that you'll be interested in, and then start reading about it as soon and as much as you can! \r\n\r\nI also liked the format for this class. Sometimes reading a book a week could be daunting, and I'd bet that each of us had a week that we didn't make it all the way through, but reading such a large volume of works helped give a fuller context for the ideas we were discussing. I also feel like I learned from my classmates, since we often got different impressions from the books and had different things to point out in class. \r\n\r\nOne weakness that I could point out was that Prof. Blight was often slow in returning papers. But, I know he had a super busy semester and was traveling literally every weekend to give book talks, so I don't blame him for this at all. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings are set up incredibly well and the first readings lay a foundation that is truly connected to the later classes and you find yourself constantly thinking about them. Prof. Blight is incredibly engaging and is obviously one of the foremost experts on this topic, but I also just found it great how much he actually wanted to hear from other students and really cared about making himself available. Only critique is that sometimes the classes felt like really long lectures because he gets really excited and can go on tangents, which was hard early in the morning, but overall amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions had in this course were its strong points. I can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list for this course was excellent. It was well-balanced in terms of genre, and provided perspectives from a diverse array of authors and research methods. Professor Blight's comments in class were always illuminating, and encouraged thoughtful reflection on the part of his students. My one suggestion for improvement is that Professor Blight give slightly more space to student comments during class - I would have appreciated more dialogue between students, and he tended to dominate the discussion. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Take it if you think you should. Don't stumble in blindly, and don't be intimidated either. The class is what people describe it to be in evals. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a million times yes. Take this class for the reading list, for Professor Blight, and for a course which will change how you view not just history but current events and pretty much everything else in our world. If you're a history major, this class will change how you approach your coursework for the rest of your time at Yale at least it will for me. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. The readings were engaging and challenged me, and Professor Blight and the class was overall dedicated and made discussion really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Without question. Just make sure you are willing to do the reading, because there is a lot of it. But every history major should at some point grapple with questions of memory and how memory influences the practice of history. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Blight is amazing. He's a world-class scholar but also incredibly humble and committed to teaching. The material is fascinating and extremely relevant. This class really changed my conception of what history is and how it interacts with us every day. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend that you take a course (especially a seminar!) with Prof. Blight if you can, regardless of the topic. I didn't think that I was particularly interested in the memory of the Civil War before I took this course, but this class made it interesting and I'm very glad that I took it. I also think that taking a course like this, where you have the chance to write a paper under someone like Prof. Blight, is incredibly valuable. Writing the paper made me start to think that I'd like to write a year-long senior thesis, so I think that the experience may be able to help you decide if that's for you or if you're interested in this kind of research. Even if that's not something that you're interested in, this was a really fun class to go to every week and I think it helped me learn a lot about history as a field. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend to anyone willing to put in a lot of work and create a lot of independent motivation, and who is really interested in a critical perspective not only about the Civil War, but the way we think about history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone only if they are willing and able to put in the work for the final paper. The class itself was incredible, but you won't get anything out of it if you don't actively choose to engage, since it only meets once a week and the assignments are largely self-directed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a rigorous and reading-heavy seminar for History majors or other humanities-oriented students. It is not an easy class, but the intellectual payoffs are great if you put in the effort. "
