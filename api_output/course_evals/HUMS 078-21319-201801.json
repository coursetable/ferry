            "\u00a0Learned about Shakespeare's use of music, and how there were a lot of unspoken musical elements in all of his plays. ",
            "\u00a0Learned studied the music of select shakespeare plays and several interpretations of these plays: settings of poetry, the Davenant restoration, 19th-21st century operas. Learned to critically analyse how the music supports the text and how Shakespeare used the text to imply music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interpret Shakespeare in a new and modern light, which was delightful! ",
            "\u00a0-appreciation of many Shakespeare plays\r\n-appreciation of classical music\r\n-appreciation of opera ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about opera and adaptation. I discovered so many versions of Shakespeare's work and new ways of appreciating it. ",
            "\u00a0A truly excellent course that encourages reading Shakespeare for broad themes, especially musical additions and stage direction. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Great course, the readings weren't too heavy, and there wasn't a lot of stuff directly derived from the readings. As for weaknesses, I can't think of any. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful easy-going course. The professor provides many resources (the readings) for us to explore and form our own questions about. Very engaging (though sometimes it is hard to engage freshman on topics such as opera that they are a bit unfamiliar with) but a very safe atmosphere to ask questions and learn from mistakes. A wonderful seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Malafronte does a fantastic job describing every piece that we went through this year because of her wealth of knowledge for each one (which was incredible to witness); however, I think sometimes it was difficult to follow along if some technical/musical terms werent explicitly defined before speaking about them. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun. It covered many Shakespeare plays and incorporated learning that was very different from my others classes, including trips to the Beinecke, the MET to watch Opera, and a lot of movies and videos. It was also a bit less organized and not quite as engaging. However, it was a nice break from my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it was engaging and offered many opportunities for hands-on learning. A weakness is that most of the adaptations examined were opera, which I was unaware of from the course description. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would. The material is super super interesting and the final project is really awesome. Lots of people get really into it and make what should be a gut a very worthwile and work-invested course with excellent results. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Rather than a close reading of the text, we studied performance practices of music in Shakespeare's time, how those performances evolved over time, and how the plays have been interpreted today. The course spans from the 17th century to the present, and includes hands on demonstrations of the instruments Shakespeare may have used, a trip to the Beinecke where we examine folios, quartos, and other music from the time. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! The professor is brilliant and the seminars are fun. Definitely worth a try. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a relaxing way of learning about a wide spread of Shakespeare plays, and some light engagement into classical music forms like opera, take this class. However if your goal is to gain a serious understanding and become an expert on opera or shakespeare, this class might be too relaxed for you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- Prof. Malafronte was excellent, and students learn a lot without an unreasonable courseload. "
