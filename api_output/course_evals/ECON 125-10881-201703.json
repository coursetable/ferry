            "\u00a0I learned that I knew very little. You come out of Intro Micro, feeling like you're on top of the world and that Micro is easy. Then, you see Kuhn-Tucker for the first time or competitive equilibrium in economies with production and you realize how complex Micro is. In this class, Micro is built from the ground up, from basic preference theory to oligopolies and price discrimination. Proofs are central to this course and I felt like I became a bit more comfortable using proofs in Econ. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nThe material can be interesting sometimes and some of the proofs are really cool. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nPrerequisites are not made clear at the beginning of class. I would recommend making clear that Multivariable Calc and Linear are required for much of this class to make sense. \r\n\r\nNo p-sets other than the one given on the first week give students no way to practice and apply knowledge gained in class\r\n\r\nDry lectures, especially to a class of only 7, don't really inspire enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nSheer amount of material to be covered and memorized make learning feel like drinking from a fire hose. \r\n\r\nImprovements: Make prerequisites clear, give more psets, change up the lecture style, cover less topics.

            "\u00a0Class is challenging but rewarding and should not be taken unless you have a strong mathematical background. Asking questions in class for things you don't understand becomes really important as the material gets harder. I learned a lot and have a stronger grasp of microeconomics in general. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, unless they had a solid foundation in econ, were passionate about Micro, comfortable with proofs, and were willing to deal with all the baggage that comes with this class. "
