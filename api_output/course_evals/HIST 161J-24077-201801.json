            "\u00a0I've taken many history seminars before, so I was pretty prepared for this course from the outset. Still, there's always room for improvement, and Professor Gage and this course in particular made me a better researcher and a sharper writer. I'd recommend this course to students who have experience with upper-level history seminars already, as it was fairly demanding, but absolutely worth it (especially with the writing workshop at the end of the term). ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about 20th century us history broadly, about radical left politics in the US in the 20th century, and about anticommunism/the FBI/ etc. I think that I will be drawing on what I learned continually throughout the rest of my history courses at yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a great deal about historical methodsstrengthening my analytical and argumentative abilities through the guidance of Professor Gage. While I believe that the course on communism provides the student with a great deal of background information on American political history, learning about these components ",
            "\u00a0This class was an excellent introduction to twentieth-century U.S. history , with more depth and new angles than what I had previously learned. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better how to analyze primary source documents, especially through the first assignment. I also better understood the relationship between communism and conservatism, and got to dive into these central questions: what is the nature of american communism? How do we define its success/failure? ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of certain aspects of the intellectual history of communism and the Right in the United States. In addition to studying these ideas, we learned a lot about the practical events that coincided with these ideas and how the ideas helped shape what America is today. Finally, this was my first real history seminar so I learned how to do archival research. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course had a compelling syllabus, especially in terms of introducing me to the long history of communism and anticommunism in the United States--there's a lot more there than just McCarthyism. The class had robust discussions and I thought a lot of our conversations were informed not just by the weekly readings, but also the primary source research we were all doing for our final paper. The library session toward the beginning-middle of the term got us all thinking about what we'd write our papers on, and I think drove many of our interests in the course. I can't think of a real weakness of this course other than the fact that we hadn't been given much feedback before the paper workshop at the end of the course. I imagine, though, that we all had a sense of how we were doing. Great course overall! ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Bev Gage is a beast and she knows it. Great job of making sure everything gets put on the table in discussion and amazing at refining and questioning people's points. NO BULLSHIT ALLOWED IN THIS CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great help with the process of writing a history paper, great leading of class discussion, great reading/film choices, great job at having the students get to know each other/ each other's scholarship\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses! An amazing class! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good discussion, strong insights and guidance from Professor Gage, plentiful feedback, great focus on strengthening writing and historical arguments.\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the readings could have been more selectively chosen (I feel that the burden of doing so much reading and often watching a movie for every week's class was often de-motivating) ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is great -- each reading was engaging and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Prof. Gage was a great discussion leader. Also the readings were generally pretty interesting but some could easily be cut / changed. For example, while the Conservative Intellectual Movement by Nash was interesting, it would be better suited in a course on American conservatism. Also, I wish the course addressed liberal anti-communism more, because it provides a really fascinating lesser-examined history relating to international politics and race, and that way, it provides a really interesting way-in to questions of modern liberal rhetoric and ideology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus is fascinating, covering a wide range of topics and very balanced in the way that it brings in readings that often disagree with each other. The material itself is quite political and engaging which makes for fun discussions. Only a small paper and a final paper are probably the best way to conduct assessments for something like this.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a lot of work, more reading than I've ever had before and some of it dense. Class discussions were pretty high level so you couldn't get away with not doing it and we had reading responses every week. I think the reading enhanced my class experience, but I think it could be trimmed at the edges for sure, the amount was stressful. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. \r\n\r\nOnly one thing-- I think there should be a more manageable amount of reading per week. I often found myself wanting to read everything but being physically unable to. I wish I had been able to do all the readings more thoroughly but the amount of reading made that impossible. \r\n\r\nI also there had been more opportunity to receive 1-on-1 feedback from Professor Gage. I often found that office hours were unhelpful. I think we all have so much to learn from Professor Gage, and it would be wonderful to have more of an opportunity to do that. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The content in this course is not only interesting, but it's an important part of American history that is often left relatively untouched in most history courses. Believe it or not, there is more to US communism and anticommunism than McCarthy! The readings present many different perspectives, weave primary accounts with secondary analysis, and really make you rethink broader questions and popular understanding about the United States, radicals, and so much more.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly, every student, if they can, should seize the opportunity to learn from Professor Gage. Not only is she brilliant, but she puts extreme effort into the course and gives incredibly valuable feedback. The final paper, like most history seminars, was very intense. It took a lot of time researching, reading secondary literature, thinking about what argument to make, andoh yeahwriting twenty pages. But it's such a valuable experience for any undergrad. Professor Gage's guidance through the process, and intense feedback on drafts, really separate this seminar from most others. ",
            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student. You should take this course if you're an upper-level history student interested in any part of U.S. history, interested in writing a senior paper requiring archival research, or generally interested in the period but want to learn more (and have taken at least one history seminar before). The syllabus and Professor Gage are fairly demanding in terms of weekly readings and the final paper, but if you put a lot into this course, you'll get a lot out. Also, Jeb Bush came to our class one week (and apparently Professor Gage has drawn other interesting visitors before), so you never know what surprise you might be in for. Overall, a very interesting topic with a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was amazing and Professor Gage does a wonderful job of leading discussions. Her energy and excitement about the material makes the class that much more enjoyable. I learned a ton about the Socialist and Communist parties in the United States, as well as about the ways in which the civil rights, liberal, and conservative movements have been shaped by Communism and Anti-Communism. The class was a great mix of history and historiography and I appreciated the opportunity to explore the ways in which understandings of Communism have polarized the way people write about an entire era of history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes. If you're willing to put in the work. About a book per week put movies and reader. Be prepared in class otherwise you will feel stupid and she will know. This is not a class you can zone out of. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend, this was the best seminar course I've taken at Yale. If you want to really work on improving your historical writing, if you want to learn 20th century history that is incredibly relevant to today, if you want to understand how the concepts of communism and anti communism that lurk behind other history narratives actually played out and changed over time-- this is the course for you! And I cannot speak highly enough of professor Gage's skill and dedication to teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this course to learn from Professor Gage. Sure, the material on communism and anticommunism are interesting in their own rightsbut the reality is that learning HOW to think like a great historian is what you'll take away from it. She provides plentiful feedback and will prod you in the right directions with your thinking and writing. There is a good deal of reading that you should anticipate, but the material can be especially interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I generally would. Just given my preference, the readings in the first half of the course (pre 1950s) werent quite as interesting to me, and much of the reading was often way longer than it needed to be. Also, the final paper topic proved much more daunting than I realized. Some of the most interesting arguments about communism/anti-communism involving finding these ideologies in areas that you might not expect. However, doing so for a final term paper isnt always so feasibly, as it takes much more time/effort. So, papers I saw often focused on less interesting internecine debates between known similar communist/anti-communist thinkers. So make sure to think wisely about a paper topic before taking the course. However, Prof. Gage was a really effective discussion leader, and the students were really engaged and thoughtful  so the class as a whole was quite interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome course and Professor Gage is a treasure, she's brilliant. This course is worth taking if you have time to have one course through which you can really engage with the material. This is not a course to half-*ss, you need to give it your all and keep up with the readings, but if you do so you'll get so much out of the discussions and feel like you learned an incredible amount at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Incredible course. Prof Gage is so brilliant and a great discussion leader. the material is fascinating. You should know in advance that it is a lot of work, but worth it! "
