I'm not totally sure I grasped their final points but I did get to read some of the Republic and the Ethics, so I feel cultured (when it comes to Western philosophy). This was my first philosophy course so I also learned about philosophical inquiry and how to deconstruct an argument. ",

            "\u00a0The main takeaway I had from this course was learning the writings and beliefs of ancient philosophers. I now know more about the beliefs of writers like Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and others, which will hopefully help me understand the writings of other, more recent, philosophers. I also got more experience writing and discussing philosophy - I feel more confident in my philosophy skills (while still acknowledging that there is plenty of room to grow) and I have a better idea of whether I want to continue philosophy. It was a worthwhile class to get a better handle on the fundamentals of philosophy. ",

            "\u00a0PHIL 125 was an interesting course that gave me insights into the basics of ancient philosophy, mostly focusing on two prominent figures: Aristotle and Plato. Because of its introductory nature, the course offered a general and broad scheme of information in the field of ancient Greek philosophy. The course's discussion section allowed for more in depth conversations on the topics covered in class, and thus helped me understand the material in a more holistic way, while I gained the insight of my classmates into the texts read. The course gave me a solid foundation on the texts that it covered, as it introduced me to the philosophies of some of the most widely-acclaimed philosophers that have ever lived. Furthermore, another aspect of the course that I found of particular interest was the way in which it helped me with expressing my ideas in writing. PHIL 125, and especially the TAs, gave me very comprehensive feedback on my writing and helped me develop my writing skills, especially in the sense of academic, philosophical writing. ",

            "\u00a0Although this course is a writing credit, there was virtually no instruction on how to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: requires a very minimal amount of work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is graded quite difficultly, and many of the topics seem extremely far-fetched. I know no philosophy professor wants to admit it, but a lot of ancient philosophy is simply outdated and verifiably wrong. I would've preferred if more time was spent on things that still had connections to the world today, such as Plato's critique of democracy, and not spent so much time on things such as whether magnets have souls. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized, as Professor Harte provides handouts with each lecture and explains the concepts very clearly. She is always glad to take questions and elaborate further. The workload for this class is also pretty light and the grading is generous (your worst paper only counts 10%). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, intellectually stimulating to think about the subjects that the philosophers write about\r\nWeaknesses: hard to stay interested on a weekly basis if you don't do the readings and go to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The handouts are really helpful ",
            "\u00a0The workload's not to bad and some of the lectures are really interesting. That being said, there were the occasionally weeks where Professor Harte talked way above most of the classes heads. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the topics could be hard to follow, and it was very easy to get lost during a lecture. Prof. Harte provided handouts containing lecture notes which were very helpful, but the course could have been improved by using more of the blackboard to help more visual learners like me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great overview of ancient greek philosophy\r\nWeaknesses: Class can get boring and kind of repetitive at points - seems like learning the same thing over and over again at points but with slight variations ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are in Professor Hart's knowledge and passion for the subject. It's not the most engaging lecture but if you pay attention you'll learn a ton and it'll be worth it. Although I do wish we'd spent some more time with philosophers besides Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nYou don't really need to attend any lecture to do well on this course, since the grades are basically purely from papers. So someone with a strong philosophy background can just type out their papers and never go to class and do better someone that was critically engaged the whole way through. ",
            "\u00a0The course contents are interesting\r\nsometimes we dive deep into some side topics and lost track ",
            "\u00a0The essays were difficult to write, and when taken into the account the feedback for the next essay(s), my grade was not improved. There wasnt a clear grading structure to the essays and it felt like I was trying really hard to improve but getting no where. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class was the readings, which were picked out very carefully (and therefore kept at a relatively manageable level). Also, we had plenty of options for our essays, and they were spaced out well, so that kept the workload to a more manageable level. However, I thought a weakness of the class was explaining the writings more clearly. While the lectures were very effective, I still often found myself confused by the text - I found myself recording lectures to play them back later, and I think that recording this class would be very effective at helping students engage fully with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it introduced us to important philosophical texts extremely well, given that most of us had had no exposure to them beforehand. Occasionally it felt like a section only dealt with a small portion of the week's reading, which was disappointing if we had focused on a different part. I might recommend having narrower readings so that everyone is on the same page. ",
            "\u00a0Section was a big strong point (TA's take a lot of time to ensure that every member of the section is getting what they need out of the material). It might've been helpful to focus on the big picture history of ideas and how they connect with one another ",
            "\u00a0The papers allowed really deep readings of small sections which seems similar to what academic \"History of Philosophy\" is. The Teaching fellows were all really nice and clearly knowledgeable about the material. Professor Harte is obviously an expert and is able to address any portion of any of the texts and clearly has a deep understanding of them. \r\nThe two main weaknesses were the lecture style and the amount of readings. First, Professor Harte's voice has a certain quality which makes it difficult to engage with what she is saying for the hour of class time. The handouts help, but it can all blur together as she doesn't really breakup her lecture, giving it the form of one continuous 50 minute monologue which can be hard to find engaging due to the monotone which she sometimes uses. In terms of reading it was manageable, but as evidenced by the papers it would be possible to spend hours reading just small portions (just a couple of pages) of the text, while we were regularly assigned 20-30 pages twice a week. This made it seem that I was missing out on a deep understanding of all we read as I wasn't able to spend hours and hours on every reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths involve great teacher and TF. The readings were sometimes long but expected. ",
            "\u00a0It covers a lot of the basics of ancient philosophy. However, they expect too much out of people who have never written a philosophy paper. They graded unreasonably hard despite the amount of work many students put in. ",
            "\u00a0The section was the best part of the course. I also appreciated Prof. Harte's attention to detail. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion sections could focus more on discussion and less on group work or general questions students have, because that would be the most helpful for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the history and philosophy were intertwined and still engaged critical thinking (eg in actually debating philosophical theories instead of just learning about them). But I wish there was more of this latter engagement (though I understand that it is difficult in a history of ancient philosophy class). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie mainly on its discussion section, and its structure. It was structured in such a way that it allowed for a very comprehensive introduction to ancient philosophy, as it started from the pre-Socratic philosophers and gradually moved on to the Socratics, the Platonists, the Epicureans, and the Stoics, always building up on pre-existing knowledge and making connections between the philosophers. It managed to convey some of the core values and beliefs of ancient philosophers in a way that was understandable for university students in the 21st century. Nonetheless, the course did not only present the ideas of the philosophers, but also it fostered an aspect of discussion, and that is something that was widely reflected on the nature of the discussion sections. The discussion section was for me an integral part of the course, as it allowed for the exchange of ideas and for the in-depth analysis of the texts that were read and presented in lecture. The TA did a very good job managing the discussion and guiding us within the complicated and many times outdated texts and opinions of the philosophers. Even though the course was very well organized and taught, I feel that there were some minor aspects of it that could be improved. One of them would be the lack of meaningful interaction in the lectures, something that may have caused them to be tiring and monotonous at times. Furthermore, the last lecture (the Survivor island lecture) was something that I thoroughly, and I wish that we could have been given some more time and guidance in order to prepare for it, but also in order to experience it. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a light workload, so students can choose what extent they would like to engage with it. The course also offers a variety of texts from Greek philosophers. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Harte is a great lecturer and helps you understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you do not enjoy vagueness, do not take this class. I would only recommend this course for someone who intends on pursuing philosophy as a major. I would not recommend this course for a writing credit. It very much feels as if it is assumed that you know philosophy to some technical degree and that you know how to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0It's a relatively small amount of work for a writing credit, so that's a plus. However, you need to be able to get through difficult concepts, especially if you care about getting a good grade. So shop it, but be wary. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as an introduction to the field of philosophy and was pleased with the experience. It's definitely one of the better courses with Intro in the title. If you're more interested in a more specific field of philosophy, like ethics, maybe look for one of those courses (though they're probably harder), but this was a nice general exposure to the subject.

If, instead, they were only interested in taking one philosophy class to broaden their horizons, but they weren't actually interested in the major, this might not be the best class to take (I recommend any class with Shelly Kagan).

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student looking to sharpen their analytical thinking and writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - philosophy is an important stream of knowledge, while an analytical reading of texts is a great skill. This is a good introductory level course that starts at the very beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Reasonably paced reading schedule with very well chosen texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Learned lots of ancient philosophy and really learned to enjoy writing descriptive philosophy essays ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a good introduction to philosophy and way to acclimate oneself with writing philosophy papers in college. ",
            "\u00a0No, the papers aren't long but their expectations are unreasonable. If you aren't one of the most amazing writers, I definitely do not recommend. It's graded really hard and despite seeing TAs and working with the professor it can still be impossible to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it gave a great introduction, and the TAs were really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Well, if you're a philosophy major, it doesn't really matter whether I recommend this course because you're gonna have to take it anyway. If you're not a philosophy major, then I probably wouldn't recommend, unless you have a particular fascination with ancient philosophy. Personally, I prefer more modern stuff. That said, this course was by no means a bad experience. The workload was low (like reeeally low), and professor Harte was good. So no complaints. Could make a good fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. I feel like I got a solid foundation and got what I wanted out of the class, but would say only a student that KNOWS they are interested in the HISTORY of philosophy should take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is challenging, despite there only being three papers all semester. Philosophy classes are more challenging than I realized, but definitely rewarding ",
            "\u00a0I had to take this class for the philosophy major, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. The content is interesting and important to know for working in Western philosophy. I'd recommend it to people interested in the major, especially if professor Harte is teaching it ",

As I mentioned above, the course gives a very comprehensive introduction to the field of ancient philosophy, and hence will allow for a good, foundational course for somebody who is interested in that field. There is no required background in philosophy for this course. ",
