            "\u00a0This course clearly teaches all of the concepts in the course description, but not even close to enough practice with questions like those on the exams is given. The psets and class exercises are mostly just to illustrate the concepts, whereas the tests require layers of interpretation of the theory. A lot more test style practice is needed. ",
            "\u00a0I had the course director, but did not feel that I learned a lot in class or in the course in general as it was a flipped classroom structure. I found I taught myself a lot of the course material from the textbook and from the internet. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to consider the flipped classroom format a weakness because I personally had trouble learning from the videos. However, I have to recognize that the videos did simplify the content and provide images of the content which helped me learn and understand what was being taught. The main weakness that I found was the fact that the problems on the p-set did not correspond in difficulty to the problems on the exams.Finally I would say that the weaknesses were the quizzes that we took after the videos because sometimes they would take a long time to complete and multiple tries simply because I had not practice with the content.

I enjoy learning in class and practicing at home because I ask questions while I learn, not after. The strength was in the size of the class. I like smaller classes, it made it easier to ask questions for clarification. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nOffice hours were very helpful. Our instructor provided us with helpful worksheets as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nToo many topics covered in a short span of time.\r\nToo much work with the flipped class system. \r\nToo little practice on the types of exam questions involved. ",
            "\u00a0I understand the idea behind a flipped classroom, but I felt that the pre-class videos rarely provided the right kind of exposure to the topics discussed. Often, I felt that the videos overexplained relatively irrelevant information while merely skimming over the stuff that was actually useful for classwork and psets. ",
            "\u00a0My instructor was really good. I just feel that it could be a little but slower and we could have more time to do exercises in class.\r\nAlso, It could not be flipped. Flipped classes are very bad ",

            "\u00a0The course is taught as a flipped classroom with videos to watch before every class. I didnt find these to be particularly helpful and the explanations were confusing and not generally helpful, so the class tone was spent re-teaching what was in the videos. If the material was just presented as new in class, I think it would have been a lot easier to understand. ",

            "\u00a0Great teaching. Rather uncreative in its approach to teaching the material, however that may be necessary for an introductory course. I didn't mind the flipped classroom and watching the online video. However, I found that the quizzes paired with the video were sometimes unreasonable (ie. open response questions with multiple parts that one had to get exactly correct to get credit for). Additionally, I found that the exams, especially midterm #1, were much more challenging than the course as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Even though I studied on my own and went to all the professor's office hours, it was hard to score an A on all the exams. However, I must admit that Professor Vigliotta was a great professor--she was really good at explaining the material and she was always so nice to her students. ",

This course assumes students have full knowledge of math 112, which unfortunately they don't. It is also very time consuming to manage with other work intensive courses. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good course if you are learning Calc 2 for the first time or reviewing it. However anyone with a strong high school foundation in Calculus would find it repetitive. ",
