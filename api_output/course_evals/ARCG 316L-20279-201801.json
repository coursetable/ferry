            "\u00a0You learn a lot about dating techniques, but the biggest skill you learn is how to conduct your own research. This class was something completely foreign to me, and I had never done research like this before. If you want some experience but don't want to do research for credit or pay, this is a good alternative. "

            "\u00a0My one qualm was just my misunderstanding of what the class would actually be, but that may have been on my end. I thought it was a good class with appropriate lectures time-wise. My one area for improvement would be guest lecturers. I found their labs interesting but not always their 'lecture' portion, but that could also be on them rather than the class itself. Overall, I think it is structured well and facilitates students' learning how to conduct research. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly, I took this class because I really like the show Bones and it seemed pretty low key. While it definitely was a chill class, it wasn't exactly what I expected. With the title of lab, I expected to be working hands on every week. Maybe I was naive in that understanding, but the class was structured more as a lecture. Each week we learned about a new technique, and the hands on portion was our final project. While not what I expected, I did enjoy the class. The project was a first time thing for me--I had never done research like that before--and as long as you start early, getting that done should not be an issue. With the low workload, I think this is a great alternative for getting research experience if you don't want to do research for credit or pay. \r\n\r\nIt was also nice that we pretty much always got out of class early (class was supposed to be 3 hours but was rarely 2). Lectures could sometimes be dry, but I found the dryer ones were the guest lecturers rather than Professors Frahm or McIntosh. Overall, pretty good class with a pretty low workload. Would recommend.
