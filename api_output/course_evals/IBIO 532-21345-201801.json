            "\u00a0Learned about the origins and roles of inflammation in physiology and disease. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new ways to view physiological systems in engineering and economic/evolutionary cost/benefit terms in order to understand  how they react when perturbed. I learned to view pathology as an extension of normal function and how every pathological condition has a normal counterpart, even if it is not readily apparent. I learned the different types, manifestations, and pathways of the inflammatory response and how it is a deeply rooted physiological function of vertebrates. ",

            "\u00a0The great strength of this course is that it develops skills in analyzing and interpreting immunobiology and other physiological systems at a deeper and more fundamental level than just memorizing pathways or ligands and receptors. This will serve us much longer in this rapidly advancing field. It is surely one of the best upper-level courses at Yale. The main weakness was logistical. It was not advertised widely and did not have a syllabus listed, and for some reason lectures began on January 3 which is unusual at least for GSAS so by the time some of us realized this we had missed several beginning lectures. By the end of the course I was wishing it could go on longer. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in delving deeper into the theoretical framework of tissue biology and inflammation. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course to learn how to approach immunobiology, pathobiology, and evolutionary medicine. Inflammation is a pervasive process that will be relevant to many systems and not just a narrow specialty. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the class helps one gain an interesting perspective on cellular relationships, and it provides a fresh perspective on inflammation. "
