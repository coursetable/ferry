            "\u00a0I learned a lot through this course, definitely more than any other art class I've taken at Yale. I learned how to express ideas visually through both content and form, and how to think critically about design. I also learned how to use Photoshop InDesign and how to make my own book. ",
            "\u00a0I have taken a few art classes before at Yale as electives, so I thought I had a decent foundation into visual design. I was completely wrong. This class totally changed how I think about design. I learned a few practical skills, like how to use Adobe InDesign, as well as some nitty-gritty terms, definitions, and history, but mostly what I learned was that every single decision that goes into a final visual art project has some effect on the way it is perceived by an audience, and how to control those decisions effectively. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how preconceptions of design can hinder our progress in it. By breaking down thoughts into abstract visualizations, we were able to understand design better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to organize information (hierarchy of information), and how to use InDesign. This class also gave me the opportunity to interact with text in a different way, and showed me the role typography plays in design. This class also made me realize that even though graphic design is a form of art, in many cases it strays away from being representational. I learned that good designs should be able to convey ideas universally without having to use imagery (such as using soft curved lines and light colors, for example, to give the impression of sleep or bed instead of explicitly depicting the term with an image of a bed).

            "\u00a0decent amount of work from class to class, but the critiques (1:50 discussion+analysis of student work) were really great and very instructional ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of this course, as taught by Yeju Choi, at least, is that one completely feels as though one is learning a brand new skill and all its component background knowledge. No assignments or lectures feel extraneous. The entire experience is deliberate, and one leaves with a feeling of accomplishment. Its major weakness is the expense. In addition to a $150 materials fee, the instructor expects a minimum of $5 a week, on average, in printing costs, and many students spent upwards of $100 of their own money (outside the materials fee) in completing the final assignment. It is a gross oversight on the part of Yale's administration that this is allowed to happen, and it put a significant damper on my semester. Academically, though, the class is immaculately planned and executed. ",

For example, one of the assignments was to redesign a poster as a way to practice information hierarchy. Class times are spent critiquing homework. These discussions are really valuable, and I learned a lot from both feedback I received, as well as feedback given to others. Professor Choi doesn't call on people to talk, so it is really on the individual to take the initiative and participate. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I think it is important for everyone to have a basic understanding of aesthetics and how people perceive design and its value. This class will get you that, but not much more. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who really are interested and would want to learn more about the process of graphic design. That being said, however, be prepared to put in time and work for this class. It really pushes you to think outside the box and apply what you learned throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, especially if you want insight on how a graphic designer must think about their work. "
