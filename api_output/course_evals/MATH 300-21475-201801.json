            "\u00a0This is my second course with Prof. Casson after having taken MATH 250. I found Prof. Casson's lectures very well-organized and clear. Prof. Casson's proofs were better than the book. An element that I really appreciate about Prof. Casson's lectures and that found in few math courses is the consistency with which we advance through topics. I never felt that Prof. Casson's lectures were rushed and this helped me immensely in understanding the proofs. Prof. Casson would emphasize the important steps of the proofs and would always address questions in class and in office hours. I found this course very well-structured and clear. Prof. Casson is very meticulous about writing the right statements on the board and he will not move on to the next statement without making sure the current one is correct. I found this degree of carefulness very helpful in analysis. ",

            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was that it was taught by Prof. Casson. I found him very clear, careful in the statements he would write on the board and helpful in answering homework questions in office hours. I also took MATH 250 with Prof. Casson. I found the material in MATH 300 clearer to understand. The class moved at a good pace. ",
            "\u00a0I actually really loved this course -- Casson is an institution onto himself in the Math department, and his notes and lectures are immensely clear. The homework is well-assigned, takes an appropriate amount of time, and the intellectual challenge is good. I do wish the grading made the final a little less high stakes, but that's the nature of many STEM courses. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are all proofs from the book, which is a weakness and strength - the proofs in the book necessarily needed to be explained, but some more examples of applying the theorems we proved (like we do on tests) would be helpful. However, understanding proofs of theorems from the book in itself also gives intuition for applying them, so it was not a strong negative aspect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material presented in the class! The material was super interesting -- enough for me to consider changing to a pure math major. \r\nWeaknesses: Disparity in feedback. Grading on the problem sets was incredibly lenient; grading on the exams less so (I think Casson literally gave an F to someone on the second midterm). There were no answer keys provided either so it meant studying for the final and midterms nigh impossible -- especially because the class gave incredibly challenging proofs on examinations (significantly harder than anything we had to do on the homeworks). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- material is very important in math.\r\nWeaknesses- probably THE worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The material is so dry and presented in a manner which makes you want to pay attention even less. The professor basically just talks at your face and doesn't care whether or not students understand the material he NEVER once stopped and asked students whether they had questions. We don't learn anything in class that isn't in the textbook, so if you don't understand the textbook you won't understand the lecture. We never went through practice examples/proofs. THERE ARE NO PSET SOLUTIONS AFTER THEY ARE DUE, NO PRACTICE MIDTERM/FINAL SOLUTIONS AND NO MIDTERM SOLUTIONS. This makes it impossible to learn from your mistakes if you don't know how the problems are actually solved. You could go to office hours, but the professor just reiterates everything he said in class- so if you didn't understand in class, you won't understand in office hours either. TA was helpful but hours were inconvenient. So what are you supposed to do when the professor, the textbook and the TA aren't helpful? Well you just don't understand anything which makes the class suck even more. ",
            "\u00a0No real weaknesses. Would be helpful to get some suggested solutions to the problem sets, but it would definitely be helpful to have solutions to the practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0The final was absurdly difficult ",
            "\u00a0It is a little dry. Hard to tell if this is he Professor or the material. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Casson is crystal clear and has a charming British accent. I wish we covered a bit more topics though ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were uninspiring and since he followed the book so closely I stopped going, and it was clear that many other students did as well. However, when you teach so close to the book that kids don't go, and then throw in some random things that aren't in the book just to mess with people, it is not appreciated. If you want kids to come to lecture, don't waste their time by just writing down the book verbatim on the blackboard. ",
            "\u00a0The book is ancient, yet costs over $200. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very difficult with a lot of work, but Professor Casson (who is unfortunately retiring) is a fantastic teacher. Also, you would think that an analysis class wouldn't be very applicable to real life, but a lot of what you learn is directly used in other mathematics and economics courses. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect.  Esp. because of Casson.  VERY sad to see him go. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus could be expanded to include more real analysis, such as more content about Banach spaces/ Hilbert spaces etc. ",

            "\u00a0Overall, the course was great. Lecture was detailed and problem sets usually had a good balance of difficulty. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it provides a foundation of understanding for basically all of math, by covering proofs of the most fundamental aspects of math, like continuity, differentiation, and integration. However, the weaknesses GREATLY outweigh the strengths. The material itself is so dry and boring, and the professor does nothing to make it interesting, so it is extremely difficult not to want to fall asleep. Lecture consists solely of the professor putting a definition or theorem on the board, writing a proof for it, saying it out loud, and repeating that process about 5-10 more times. He NEVER stops to ask us if we have any questions, NEVER checks for understanding, and RARELY gives examples as to how the information is actually useful or even usable in a problem. He NEVER posts any solutions for problem sets after they are due, or for any practice exams, or for the actual midterms, so there is no way to learn from your mistakes. His office hours are unhelpful because he just repeats what he says in class, and the textbook is also exactly what he says his class, so forget about those options for getting help. There is a peer tutor who can be helpful, but the hours are very sparse and inconvenient, and they are not allowed to meet outside of their office hours, which is very unfortunate. This class definitely needs HUGE reform if the math department wants to stop scaring people away from the math major. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely we'll run thanks to Prof Casson. Perhaps there should be more peet tutor help hours. Borys was wonderful, I would have liked to have sessions with him thrice a week. ",
            "\u00a0great course ",
            "\u00a0strengths: don't have to go to lecture if you are reading the textbook closely\r\nweaknesses: book problems can sometimes be inaccessible without having a group, no solutions. ",
            "\u00a0The grade distribution for the class is harsh, but made clear from the beginning. The lectures were very clear and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I am really surprised that especially for a large math class there are very few resources available. There is only one ULA and no TAs. This course would greatly benefit from having more resources, especially since it is a course people tend to struggle with especially in the beginning of the semester. ",

        [
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student if it is taught by Prof. Casson. His strengths are clarity and a steady pace. I do not remember Prof. Casson skipping any theorems and he always took the necessary time to write out and explain the proofs of the most important theorems. Even for theorems that were not proved in class, Prof. Casson would always write the page on the book were the proof was found. The fact that Prof. Casson moved at a steady pace really helped me understand, because I have also taken courses were the pace was faster and I was using office hours to discuss things mentioned in class, whereas in MATH 300 I went to office hours to discuss the ways I had attempted to solve problems, but which had not worked. By moving at a steady pace, Prof. Casson helped us a lot understand the material and solve the problems. ",

            "\u00a010/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!! So bad all the other evaluations are a lie. Math 250 is 10 billion times easier than this. Don't be fooled. Make sure you know what you're getting into if you want to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course kicked my ass. But it's also one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Casson's lecture is excellent. Though he destroyed the class on the final, he usually curves so we'll see I guess lol. I came into the class with only Math 120 and 222, and I needed to work hard but did not feel behind. ",
