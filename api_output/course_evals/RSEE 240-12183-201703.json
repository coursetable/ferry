            "\u00a0The course was interesting and the professor was very flexible with assignments. This allowed for the class to focus solely on discussing the films. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class was the depth of analysis  Professor von Kunes has a excellent grasp on the material and communicated the nuances integral to popular views of Formans cinematography clearly and effectively. A weakness was that it was difficult to offer in writing a grounded critique of the films before we discussed them in class. "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to students who have an interest in Czech history or culture. While the course includes Milos Forman's famous films, the majority of the course is focused on his lesser-known films. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is well taught and allows me to view film more critically. A valuable skill to have. "
