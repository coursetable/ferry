            "\u00a0This class was excellent. Reading the most important texts from 1620 up to 1865 was a gratifying experience and showed to me the basis on which many of our American values are founded. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a bit tricky to define. What exactly is it? History? Humanities? Philosophy? Literature? None of the above really, but also all of the above. I think this class should be capped for seniors ad juniors with stronger pre-requisites, because the level of intellectual discussion and the anthology-style selection of readings make it hard to take this as an entry-level America course. I'm glad I took it senior year, having taken DS as a freshman, because it allowed me to pull in all the ideas from my four years at Yale and think about my country. There were a lot of \"ra ra America\" types in class, but they got put in their place pretty quick once we read about the genocide of native americans, or the puritans and their moralizing. I would say the biggest \"skill\" I took away from this class was how to think across disciplines about America. They say DS helps you do that, but even DS is too disparate to feel cohesive. This course succeeds, and with Smith and Garsten at the helm, I felt that the class really bonded. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills and the way that I approach difficult texts. I also learned a great deal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about the thoughts and texts that developed the American imagination. Learned a lot about American political philosophy ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class. Understand American political thought much better ",
            "\u00a0This course was unique in offering not only a history of America and her evolution, but in considering the varying strands of thoughts, vying for influence in this new country. The course was an excellent balance of literature, political thought and anthropology. The course taught to be sensitive in weighing and considering the various sources of influence in America. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of key elements of American history, literature, art, and political philosophy from the Puritans (pre-Founding) to the end of the Civil War. ",
            "\u00a0An ideological investigation of the United States-- as concept, reality, and identity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to appreciate and reconsider the founding political, philosophical, and literary roots of America. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exceptionally structured to shed light on different veins of American thought that have shaped the character of the nation since its earliest times. As a hybrid lecture-seminar course, you are able to listen to insightful lectures on the material, as well as discuss the readings with a small group of about 12 students every week which was a great experience. This course will challenge you to make connections across religious, political, and literary thought from the time of the Puritans to the Civil War, and to ask big questions like \"does an American Identity exist?,\" all while surrounded by enlightening primary texts and great thinkers. The reading load was heavy, but always extremely interesting, and will help you undercover facets of the American intellectual tradition to which you were previously unaware. With a midterm and a final paper, this course challenges you to write on themes which run across different sources from different genres and times, which I know definitely helped me grow as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. First, I picked up a true appreciation and a deeper understanding of the American Imagination and all its complexities and uniqueness. Second, I developed my critical assessment skills and fine-tuned my historical thinking. And lastly, I thought about so many important topics and got used to asking questions that will never be fully answered and will follow me through life. "

            "\u00a0The diversity of opinion was broad and led to really engaging classroom debates. Being taught by two of the best Humanities professors does tend to lead to bright students taking the class. However, the diversity of experience was very shallow: a lotta white guys. The class was called The Puritans to the Civil War, and was only labelled as a Humanities and PoliSci course; I believe these two factors led to the whiteness of this class. For starters, the title is unintentionally exclusionary and misleading: this class is a study of ideas and does not revolve around the Puritan narrative. Around a third of the class was dedicated to the debates about slavery, and this alone made the course well worth taking just to fully understand the different ideas. This course should have been labelled as The American Imagination, because that's what it was about, and should also be cross-listed as an AFAM, AMST, and HIST course to attract more people for a more diverse discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Reading list is great. Professors are knowledgable about the material. \r\nWeaknesses: This class felt like a white boys club, and even though I'm a white guy, even I felt a little left out of the intellectual circle jerk of Humanities/Philosophy majors. I'm an English major, and thought I'd be able to tap into the material with my literary background, but the class was pretty balanced toward political theory and philosophy, and it was pretty clear nobody really did the poetry/literature readings, which was sad. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the class was good, but sometimes I wished we had two lectures a week rather than one, since I took away a lot more from the lectures than I did from sections. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized, and lectures were terrific. I loved the extracurricular aspects, and the fact that we got to have section with both Professors. The papers were fun to write and challenging. The reading responses were a bit disorganized--I would have preferred them to be more consistent, or not to have had them at all (or for the expectations for them to be more clear). I also would have loved 2 weeks on Lincoln. Overall, terrific. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved everything about the course, although I do wish we had more feedback on our writing so that we could've improved more over the semester. Besides that, a perfect class ",
            "\u00a0Great course. A few suggestions. The 75 minute lecture is really a bit too long and about as much could probably be accomplished in 50 minutes as the DS lectures do. The sections could do with being longer, perhaps a more typical 1:50 seminar.\r\n\r\nI also found the quantity of readings occasionally overwhelming. Perhaps the readings reduced by 25% or so and the others put under \"recommended readings\". That way if a student wanted to write an essay on a particular week, they could add those readings as well. They could also be briefly introduced in the lectures.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed that the professors switched half-way through and will likely continue to take the class in the spring. ",
            "\u00a0Very well conceived course. ",
            "\u00a0More feedback from professors on how students are doing ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course that was incredibly interesting. It could have benefited from more organization. ",
            "\u00a0The course was an exemplar of the best of yale and elevated thorough intellectual discussion beyond easy blanket statements. The course could be improved by uploading the readings in proper time the week before, and in providing comments and feedback about the reading responses to students. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing coherence of material, despite the range of disciplines and period of time covered. Stayed general, as it had to, without giving the feeling that we were \"just\" skating the surface. \r\n\r\nWish that reading responses had been released earlier in the week (they often came out the same day/the day before they were due) and more consistently (we missed a bunch of weeks). ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus and lectures were excellent, and the lecture/seminar organization split between two professors was very effective. The two essay format was also fine, but the reading responses could have been more structured. There were several weeks where prompts were not posted and no instructions were given as to what students should do. Also, while the syllabus suggested that responses would be graded across the term, grades were never received. I would suggest keeping the responses, but giving general writing topics or suggestions at the beginning of the term for each week to avoid week-to-week confusion. ",
            "\u00a0The diversity and order of primary texts in the class was really exceptional, and having both Prof. Smith and Prof. Garsten teach the course was a great way to receive alternating perspectives on the material. There were certain times throughout the semester that having two professors teach the course led to miscommunications in weekly assignments/class location, so perhaps having just one professor be in charge of updating Canvas would help streamline the course communications. I thought the hybrid lecture-seminar structure, although it took some getting used to, worked very well given the content of the course, and I hope that it will become a trend in other departments as well. Also, the weekly Canvas 1-2 page writing assignments always felt a little half-hearted  I think I would have preferred to have either a class forum, as a way to extend the seminar discussion, or to write 2 midterm papers, so you could really sink your teeth into the material beyond the scope of the 1-2 page assignments. Regardless, the course was overall very strong and I think it had quite a successful maiden voyage. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong; it gives a thorough view of the American Imagination and it is a wonderful introduction to the roots of our political, social, and cultural thought. I very much appreciated that the instructors took a wide selection of documents for us to examine. "

            "\u00a0If you care about America, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE AS A SENIOR. IT WON'T BE AS FUN, OR NEARLY AS MEANINGFUL, UNLESS YOU'VE TAKEN 3+ YEARS OF HUMANITIES COURSES AT YALE. Directed Studies isn't a pre-requisite, but it may as well have been. Also, if you are black, latino, female, or genderqueer, please please please shop this class. This class is really quite incredible, and you're forced to think about HUGE ideas and ask REALLY relevant questions about our current political scene, but it doesn't work if everyone in class is a white dude. So please, give this class a chance. I know it sounds kind of pretentious, but it IS worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course, because the subject matter is fascinating, and the course provides close engagement with two incredible professors. ",
            "\u00a0An absolutely essential course for anyone interested in politics, philosophy, history, literature, or just America. Every lecture will inspire, excite, or challenge you -- a must take.\r\n\r\nThe class takes an incisive look at the American project and the history of the American mind. What narratives or goals define the American project? Does a collective American imagination exist? You'll grapple with these questions all semester long, and although you probably won't leave with answers, you will be better prepared to understand America's history and its future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0For sure. Both professors are excellent and the readings are very well chosen. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. One of my favorite courses taught at Yale by two brilliant professors. The class format is engaging and intellectually stimulating (Lecture Monday seminar Wednesday). Garsten and Smith complement each other and are experts on the subject matter. Lots of reading but you get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. Great material and professors. One of the best courses I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course with excellent professors. If you are interested in the subject material, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly Yes - Take this course ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal class with professors who are knowledgeable, available, and eager to engage with students. The YUAG trips and dinner discussions with guests made it an immersive experience. ",
            "\u00a0In a heart beat-- just be sure that your schedule could accommodate a formidable amount of reading... not to mention the weekly two-page reading response essays. But if you are at all able to commit the time, Professors Garsten and Smith are among the best. ",
            "\u00a0I would fully recommend this course to any student at Yale. I am almost inclined to say that American Imagination should be required, or at least promoted in a way similar to Directed Studies. Until the day that high schools can adopt a curriculum that favors collegiate-style, close readings of primary documents, this course was the first time I've read most of these crucial American works seriously. In a time where no one really seems to understand what America has become, this class makes a noble attempt to examine what it set out to be. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student  this is an excellent course for any student across the spectrum of history, philosophy, literature, humanities, political science, EP&E, and Global Affairs to gain a better understanding of the ideas and assumptions which have helped shape the American character for the past four centuries. I really appreciated how this course began with the Puritans, rather than the Mayflower or 1776  for, having the Puritan Imagination as a touchstone throughout the rest of the readings really helped create a cohesive narrative of the root of American mores which I had not encountered before. And, while obvious foundational texts are analyzed in the course (ex. the Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers), I was introduced to a wealth of American thought that I don't think I would have found in a differently structured course. As a sort of \"DS for America\", this course will truly expand your understanding of what, if they exist, are America's core principles in relation to a national narrative. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It's one of those courses that should be required as understanding the country we live in is such a crucial skill. "
