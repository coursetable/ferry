            "\u00a0This is easily one of the worst courses Ive ever taken at Yale, if not THE worst one. I would go as so far as to say that I prefer gen chem lab with Dr. G over this course. The lab manuals are poorly writtenits almost a free-flow of thoughts rather than a well-organized manual of procedures/insights. They often have pertinent information given at the end/briefly mentioned once. However, this is not the worst of it. You really dont get any contact with the professors (and when you do, they just refer you to the TF), although they seem cool, if not indifferent. The TFs are mostly first-years who are eager to bring you down, belittle your questions, have as little contact with you as possible, or straight-up have no idea what the lab information is (an answer of Hmm, I dont know. What youre saying makes sense but also I dont know. is not uncommon). My own TF was pretty good, but still a bit frustrating to see it collectively. They dont have a set of rubrics or guidelines from the professors, so theyre also mostly just reaizing/making up information as you go through the lab. This translates to gradingthere are no formal rubrics. The exams are the WORSTinstead of using to really learn a concept, you have a series of three very, very rushed experiments that you just finish and do for the sake of the graders joy in destroying you. You dont get time to think, which is ironic but not surprising from this class. The professor said the exams are not meant to be cruel but LOL you really dont learn much about physics at all. If anything, I guess you learn more about how to use LoggerPro? Literally will retain nothing from this course. The exams are really not conducive to reinforcing any of the knowledge either. But if you have to take it, you do. Its mostly pointless concepts you can just understandthat are weirdly made difficult and convoluted. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: in a few cases (especially rotational motion) is helpful in helping you understand topics covered in lecture (phys 180)\r\nweaknesses: labs are incredibly boring and require strict attention to tiny details, neglecting conceptual understanding in many cases since you must focus on the exact number of decimal places to use in one part of an equation. Actual skills are really poorly taught. For example, you must learn uncertainty calculations, but instead of actually teaching them, they're just sprinkled in here and there and it's expected that you somehow uderstand them. Grading is arbitrary and feedback is almost nonexistent. The final is not even technically difficult, but the ridiculously short amount of time given per experiment means it is a very stressful time crunch. Overall just a very disappoitingly poorly organized course that amounts to a grand waste of time and lots of needless stress. ",

Aside from the differences in how TA's evaluate work, there is not enough explicit information about what we are being graded on. In regards to the midterm, there was no rubric publicly provided to the students. Errors you made were not explained at all (at most a few words), leaving you with no idea as to how to improve. Also, the course packet, while detailed and mostly thorough, should be simplified, allowing students to focus on one key takeaway per lab instead of five. Furthermore, the wording of the course packet is confusing at times, leaving the students to batter their TAs with questions. ",

Many helpful resources on the Canvas website, such as reference sheets, excel sheets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lab manuals are very poorly written, which result in a lot of confusion until your TA clears things up. ",
            "\u00a0I though the course tried to make the content interesting, but honestly, there is little fun in doing uncertainty calculations 5 times. There are some labs such as the ones where we could spin around on a chair that seemed interesting, but others made us try to become another Galileo. ",

            "\u00a0This class is very well organized and the workload is perfect for a lab class (I have never ever written this in a review before). The post-lab assignments are simple and the midterm and final are necessary. The experiments are also as fun as they can be, and they are informative. One weakness is that the final exam was unnecessarily difficult, such that it made me question whether I had learned anything during the semester. Also, students' overall experience of the course varies drastically depending on their TA's. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good packets, helpful TAs, nice professors\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the experiments were a little too trivial... e.g. coin flipping. ",
            "\u00a0For me one of the biggest weaknesses was the weekly reports. For literally every other science we write formal lab reports. I thought the summary and afterthoughts thing was well intentioned, but doesn't really hit the mark because all those who are taking the class and going into science will have to write formal reports, it doesn't make sense not to in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: no standardized grading. The instructors NEED to fix this because this is not okay. I don't care what they say about 'normalizing the grades.' If all the students in one section are scoring near perfect, what exactly are you normalizing to? ",
            "\u00a0It is 0.5 credits, which i find to be a disgrace. The workload for this, in terms of preparation and write-ups, should have been worth a full credit. It just took away from the course if I didn't feel that it was worth my time to put that much effort in for so little benefit. The material was actually interesting, though. Write-ups were a bit annoying because they were graded in a picky manner. Some labs felt unnecessary ",
            "\u00a0While I found most of the experiments to be engaging and interesting, some seemed to be out of place with the course goals. That said, the experiments were well written and instructed. However, for a note on laboratory courses in general, I strongly believe that they should be worth one credit compared to the half credit that they are currently worth. Not only is the class three hours long (and for chemistry four hours), but also this course requires an equal amount of time outside of class compared to one credit courses, that results from laboratory reports and pre-laboratory reading. ",
            "\u00a0While the labs were interesting, sometimes I felt they were leading us in a certain direction too directly, as if we knew exactly where we wanted to end up. This made the labs easier, but at the same time, made them feel more like a task or a chore rather than an experiment. ",
            "\u00a0This course required very little critical thinking as they lay out all the laboratory procedures for you.

I spent so much time rewriting all my lab notes because if I didn't I would lose many points. So much time was spent calculating uncertainties instead of exploring physics. So many cool things could be done with this course... but instead it is a weekly pain, especially if you have a nitpicky TA.

PHYS is not a light subject, and a lot of the labs in this course need knowledge prior to conducting the lab. For example, we did a lab on angular momentum and my teaching fellow was surprised to hear that my class hadn't touched on the topic before because she didn't think it was a topic that could be understood in the lab we were given and in the 3 hours we had to do it. Either make the class correspond to something that provides the background knowledge, or provide the knowledge in the class itself through lessons (not just through the summaries in the lab reports). This is imperative, especially if we are expected to showcase a full understanding of the material during the midterm and final exams. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: my TA Hannah was really nice. Weaknesses: different TA's have very different grading styles and an A with one TA might be a B with another. The final exam was crazy -- I think it dropped my grade so much because I kept running out of time to do the stations. I felt like the final exam was impossible to prepare for since they expect you to do the experiments in 1/3 the amount of time we usually have in class. It's intimidating being like one of the only premeds in a class full of engineer and physics people. I also feel like I didn't learn anything concrete from this class-- it was just a lot of pain and suffering doing lab reports each week. I only learned how to use LoggerPro from this class and that's not a very helpful skill since I don't plan on taking any more physics lab classes after the spring. ",

I dreaded going to this class every week because I never found the labs interesting, useful, or good at teaching or reinforcing the concepts behind the experiments. I never felt like I learned anything from the experiments we were doing, and they often felt very trivial and pointless. There also wasn't a lot of feedback to improve our learning or correct us if we came to the wrong conclusions or didn't understand the concepts and the results fully. The weekly lab reports sometimes felt like busy work, and I didn't really learn much by doing them; additionally, the grading sometimes wasn't very clear, particularly relating to the \"insight\" section because the syllabus and all of the TAs weren't very clear on what exactly they were looking for. I also had a major problem with the ways that we were assessed in this class. While every week was structured as doing one experiment with a partner in a 3 hour block of time, the midterm was one experiment in one hour while the final was 3 experiments, each taking 55 minutes. The assessments were not reflective of how we learned the material and performed the experiments at all. The time constraint experienced during the assessments, since we only have one hour or less time for an experiment even though we have grown accustomed to having 3 hours per experiment, caused a lot of anxiety and stress that could have been avoided if the weekly labs reflected what we would be expected to do in the assessments. Overall, I think this course needs to change in a lot of ways. ",

I did not believe that the labs throughout the course prepared me for the final. Although the midterm was helpful in giving me an idea of how the final would be like, it would have been more be helpful to provide us with feedback on how to improve after the midterm for the final practical. The grading was very dependent on the TA, especially the \"insight\" portion of the lab report which my TA never provided clear feedback on how to improve on. ",

They were very tedious, and it seemed like my TA wasn't even sure about the correct way to do things sometimes. Also, the final was the worst thing I have ever done, and ruined the fact that the labs at the end of the semester were kind of fun. That kind of time pressure makes no sense -- I understand making sure that we can apply the concepts and skills we learned, and that time shouldn't be unlimited, but it's outrageous to ask us to do it in an hour. It was so stressful and an unnecessarily horrible experience. ",

I happened to have a good TA, who could explain confusing concepts in lab as they came up, but a lot of my friends in other sections fumbled through the labs without a clear idea of what they were doing. Also, the midterm and final experiments were just a poor gauge of our understanding throughout the semester, especially since we were so pressured for time throughout. An improvement would be to maybe design the midterm and final to be more similar to what we did throughout the semester, and make them count for less of our grade. ",

The weaknesses are that a lot of any given student's experience relies on their specific TA, and that the final lab practical is very stressful.

The insight points that we were asked to include in each lab report also seemed unnecessary and were arbitrarily graded. Also, the midterm and final brought an unnecessary amount of stress. For context, I was taking a full STEM courseload this semester, and physics lab was my most stressful final. That shouldn't be the case. ",

I actually think the exam questions were pretty good in that they really forced you to think deeply about the concepts emphasized in the class, but I feel like we didn't have enough practice questions similar to the exams to really reinforce the ideas that had been introduced to us.

            "\u00a0This course is not really about physics, and the labs only demonstrate the most basic of physics concepts (gravity makes things fall!). It's well organized and fairly well taught, but the content is boring and not useful. ",
            "\u00a0This is usually a required course. It evokes the same combination of boredom and rage as trying to communicate with Yale Health, driving across the Midwest in the winter, or making pasta for ten people by hand without a machine. If Phys 165L was a mode of transportation, it would be Spirit Airlines/Ryanair. The labs, which are seemingly graded by a random number generator, are designed to be so long and demoralizing that you leave every day with a renewed hatred of the sciences. If I was an unethical FBI interrogator, I would force suspects to do the lab where you flip a coin 100 times (and perform meaningless, opaque calculations on the results) over and over until they confessed. The final and midterm are barely related to the actual course material, impossible to study for, and could either be very difficult or very easy. Taking these exams is like appearing on a petty physics-themed version of Chopped/Iron Chef, which should not determine 40% of your final grade. The only good thing about this course is that everyone else in it hates it as well, which creates a camaraderie (except for the hyper-competitive premed snakes, who make up a significant portion of the class) not often seen in Yale courses. Every week, I would walk up science hill, inevitably in the cold and rain, wondering why I had been cursed with this academic requirement. Entering SPL, I would run into all the other students who were waiting for the classroom to open while rage-eating a mediocre quest bar from KBT. The mood in the hallway before the rooms open is very negative--I saw people crying there multiple times and didn't question it at all because this is a normal consequence of Phys 165L (or having to be on science hill for any reason, for that matter). Then, I would take the prelab quiz, which is usually very easy but has little relation to the lab itself. After three hours (never less, maybe more if I was unlucky) of futile physics experiments and arcane uncertainty calculations, I would be finally freed from the evil clutches of LoggerPro, a computer program used in all the labs which was probably last updated before my birth and is less functional than a humanities major's CS50 project. Dehydrated and demoralized, I would descend science hill, thankful that I had survived that week's iteration of Phys 165L. Over the next week, I would write a lab report on my results, which usually took an hour or two at most but had to be single-spaced  (at least the required font wasn't Wingdings, which seemed likely given the absurdity of this class). \r\nHere is a short list of things I would rather do than take this class, so you can further grasp its nature:\r\n-eat at saybrook every meal for an entire semester\r\n-break my hand again\r\n-clean up the floor at Toads\r\n-become a froco and stand duty for all 24 hours before & during spring fling\r\nIf you are not required to take this course but are still planning to, this reviewer is here to tell you that there are healthier and more fun ways to explore your masochistic needs.
