            "\u00a0I learned a wide variety of skills for music analysis and composition. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great deal of perseverance by taking this course. I experienced a rough beginning since my music theory background was limited, but through the help of the instructor and my own determination, I managed to show a strong upward trend. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better compose according to the conventions of the classical style. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive knowledge of figured-bass, roman numeral analysis, chord progressions, modulations, sequences, chromaticism, applied chords, etc., and a lot of skills in model composition. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis and composition in music ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of music theory including species counterpoint and some form and harmony. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely introduced me to the Classical style of music. It taught me about how chords worked and how they related with each other in a piece of Classical music. It also taught me how pieces of music are structured melodically. We analyzed many different pieces of music, from string quartets to operas, to see how the cadences worked. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of musical analysis, with important thematic ideas, such as the metaphor of stability-instability-stability. Important skills included Roman numerals, figured bass and things to look for when analyzing music. I improved my knowledge of harmony and am now able to articulate ideas about it in addition to just understanding it. I enjoyed the opportunity to engage in model composition. I think that the course will serve as a good foundation for my future studies in both theory and performance. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in-depth knowledge of composing in the Classical style. "

            "\u00a0This course was both engaging and useful. By the end, I was able to confidently apply the skills I learned to compose a theme and variations for piano and a minuet and trio for string quartet. Additionally, the homework did a good job on testing my understanding of the concepts. The course could be improved by allocating more time for reviewing the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a very good course! Felt a little rushed but we covered a lot and I felt secure by the end of it anyways. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very knowledgeable professor, always info to fall back on, well-taught, rigorous, musical examples are a lot of fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: workload was sometimes very high and at times frustratingly so, although it might have been for the best. ",
            "\u00a0Students come in with different backgrounds and might be more difficult for those with less experience ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was its focus on composition. The homework often let me compose music in the Classical style, which helped me learn more about what types of harmonies and melodies could be used. However, the course could be improved by spending a little bit more time in the beginning on the fundamentals of music theory, like Roman numeral analysis. Everyone in the class is expected to have a background in music, but only some have experience with the Classical style in particular, so additional resources would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured and there were often interesting connections between ideas discussed in different classes. I felt the workload was the right amount. I liked the balance between theoretical readings and practical exercises. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course emphasized Roman numeral analysis a bit more, as I found some of the concepts hard to grasp without it. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The class definitely achieved the goals listed in its syllabus, and it teaches useful skills in the field of music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, take a look at the professor. I took this course with a grad student (Ethan Edl) who may not teach the course again. Our class was significantly more rigorous than the sections with Nate Adam and Ian Quinn, with a far greater workload and more strict grading; however, we also learned an incredible amount, and having seen several final projects in all classes, I'm very glad I took the section with the highest workload because I think it really paid off. The class is mandatory for all music majors, but even for non-music majors, I would recommend it, although if you are not a musician, it might be too much unless youre in one of the easier sections. ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY. Ethan is a great instructor, and although he is pretty strict, it's really for your own good. I've learnt so so much in his class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good introduction to music theory. Depending on the profesdor the level of workload varies. ",
            "\u00a0Students interested in learning Classical-style music would gain a lot from this course. I would recommend this course to other students only if they wouldn't mind the Classical period emphasis as they learned the theory topics covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Even for someone with limited experience with the Classical style of music, this course was very rewarding, and I now feel like I have a much better understanding of Classical music. This course inspired me to think more critically about chords and gave me a much greater appreciation for Classical music. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in music, from any background, take this course. You may have to put in a little extra effort if you are not familiar with the Classical style already, but it is worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it provides a systematic review of the fundamentals of music theory, and uses this knowledge to teach model composition. There is a good balance between studying and analyzing classical excerpts, and using ideas gained from this process to write one's own music. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It gives you a full and comprehensive understanding of tonality in the Classical period. "
