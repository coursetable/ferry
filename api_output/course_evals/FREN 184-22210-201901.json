            "\u00a0I came into this course with very little knowledge of business or business in France. I gained a lot of new knowledge on the structure and organization of various companies, historical issues as well as contemporary trends. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed us to further develop, and perfect, our French language skills in the area of business. We discusses multiple aspects of the French economy, and how it ties into French politics, which was very interesting and insightful.

            "\u00a0This course had a well-chosen films and readings that were genuinely interesting to someone who doesn't know much about economics. I thought the film screenings could have been more conveniently scheduled so I didn't have to keep going to the Film Study Center to watch them. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts - many conversations, presentations; improves speaking skills\r\nWeaknesses - long readings, difficult to deeply engage with course topic since reading and understanding takes time ",
            "\u00a0Most of the work for the course was reading which was very passive.\r\nMy learning and engagement would have benefited from more regular interactive/proactive work\r\n\r\nVery good, comprehensive feedback after presentations and written assignments. Was very clear and specific ",

            "\u00a0It is an engaging course with interesting material. It is geared more towards being better fluent in speaking french than writing which was great since most other french courses cater for writing and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Grades are very heavily based around a couple of presentations and essays while discussions in class mostly cover the readings. Perhaps having fewer presentations and more short reading responses would improve understanding each article/chapter/essay. ",
            "\u00a0I found some of the readings a little too technical considering I have no prior experience with business so I felt as though I didnt understand as much from the readings as from the class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I highly enjoyed the course as it allowed for a lot of in class discussion, which is fundamental for improving language skills. The weekly course load was appropriate and the assignments were fun and engaging. The course could have been improved in terms of its structure. Even though all of the subjects were interesting, it was difficult to find a connection and overview at times. "

Also, if you're fluent in French and really want to learn more about French business. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it was really interesting to apply my French abilities so a new topic. It was so different than other French grammar courses that I have taken in the past. ",
