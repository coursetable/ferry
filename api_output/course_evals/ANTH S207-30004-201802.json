            "\u00a0The skill of English writing and listening, since it is my second language.\r\nThe curiosity to explore unfamiliar area.\r\nUnderstanding that there are so many people around world doing the significant work about cultural heritage. ",
            "\u00a0I was so fascinated by the depth of Stefan's and other lecturers' thought about cultural heritage. Since my childhood, cultural heritages are so familiar to me, because my country has many historical sites, protect them as a national policy, and each of us can visit them or get involved with them easily. However, I came to know that our culture and tradition is so well preserved compared to other nations. I came to know the international law framework for preservation of cultural heritage, the physical and political risks heritage sites and objects are exposed to,  the projects held in many countries to nurture the mind of preservation of cultural heritage in indigenous people, and the last but not the least, how important cultural heritage is to people of that culture and to all of us. This course was such a good experience that we learned this whole thing in one month through hearing from Stefan, Pete, Goze, Lucas, and other special lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0challenge about preservation of cultural heritage, the assessment of cultural heritage, visited lots of diverse collections ",
            "\u00a0- An in-depth understanding of the contemporary challenges facing cultural heritage \r\n- The reasons why cultural heritage must be preserved during our time\r\n- Greater insight into the different methods of cultural heritage preservation and protection in addition to learning about the effectiveness of each method\r\n- Learnt about the preservation of cultural heritage on a number of levels (i.e. local vs. international, theoretical vs. practical, etc.)\r\n- Developed my knowledge of the study of cultural heritage as a highly inter-disciplinary subject which requires input from a number of different fields\r\n- Developed the following skills: public speaking/presentation, critical thinking, scientific analysis and methodology in addition to techniques of evaluation.

            "\u00a0very good course, almost no weakness. perfect teacher and TA ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely interesting content and speakers who were mostly very inspiring and passionate about their area of work or research. This made the course highly engaging and enjoyable. The course allowed students to engage in thoughtful discussion with one and other in addition to experts in the field, facilitating new thoughts and ideas.  \r\nWeaknesses: Too much tried to be covered in one class making classes quite exhausting for students. Very little feedback given throughout the course.  \r\nImprovements: Increase class time so there is adequate time to cover each topic. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this course, in particular to students who has architectural backgrounds. I have some architectural backgrounds actually, but we don't really know about cultural heritages because our usual course are intended to learn modern and comtemporary architecture. I think it is important to know about preservation of cultural heritages because they matter to us when we think of urban planning or architectural design. ",
