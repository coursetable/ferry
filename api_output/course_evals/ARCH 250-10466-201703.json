            "\u00a0I learned to think iteratively and improved my design process since we finally got to work with an actual site. ",
            "\u00a0The most valuable skill I gained from this course was the beginnings of a process of design, and the courage to pursue the little fancies that eventually generate a robust design process. ",
            "\u00a0Working with various machines, like the 3D printer, laser cutter, woodshop, etc. ",
            "\u00a0How to think about design and a set of tools for conceptual and visual approaches. The TAs taught us solid skills on 3D modeling, modelmaking and graphic production. ",
            "\u00a0This first junior design studio did a great job establishing a pedagogical practice of iterative design, as well as teaching students how to create a lexicon and narrative to surround a studio project. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I developed both an understanding of my own working process and computer/drawing/modeling skills for demonstrating an idea. This course was incredibly difficult because it takes a lot of work to bring an architectural idea to fruition. There is really no end to the design process. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a junior studio and I think it could benefit from being more grounded in architecture. Some of the stuff we did was too abstract and more of an art class than an architecture class. I think it would be interesting to have some crits come do desk crits with us. When we only hear outside review at the end it doesn't help our projects. ",
            "\u00a0While the course is different for everyone, I thought the course was very well organised and well considered. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments required a broad array of representation from drawings to collages to models, which made you explore and develop different media. \r\nThe final assignment was a really good design exercise, and I appreciated how you could set up the problem yourself and solve/respond to it through design.\r\nThe TA sections were very helpful. Azza and Dimitri were fantastic. \r\n\r\nThe Dialogues were helpful in thinking about design steps, but it would have been even more helpful if it was shortened a little and replaced by another short design assignment before the final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Like most studio / architecture courses I've taken, this junior studio could have done a better job teaching raw skills. Still, it established a solid approach to designing both abstract and real architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly self-directed course. The structure was well thought out, with the initial project acting as a warm-up and the second half of the semester focusing on an architectural project. We had regular check-ins with the professor and TAs on our progress. ",
            "\u00a0This course was less focusedan on actual architecture and more on design which can be fun, but is largely not useful both in our learning process and in finding internships. ",
            "\u00a0The overall structure of the course was a bit unbalanced, and the workload is likewise spread unevenly. "

            "\u00a0Architecture majors dont have a choice, but I found the course most valuable when pursuing a line of thinking most personally interesting. The TFs and Rosalyne are fantastic, and will drive you to think in the ways you want to improve. ",
            "\u00a0um, take it if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you are prepared to really work at it. You will learn an incredible amount about your own working/design process as well as computer programs and drawing and modeling techniques. The work is mostly self-directed, with regular progress check-ins with the professor and TAs. The structure was well thought out, with the initial project acting as a warm-up and the second half of the semester focusing on an architectural project. ",
            "\u00a0I understand that most architecture students have to take this course, however the class was very poorly structured, often times assignments weren't entirely thought through (in terms of scale or type of requirements) and would have to be revised upon students questioning. I know that the idea was the foster each students own design process, however the lack of focus on architecture until the very end made the course own seem scattered or without a point. The feedback from the professor was also very inconsistent, sometimes pointing us toward her own design ideas, other times giving us vague criticism that was difficult to build on, and occasionally helping us to think of our own new and interesting ideas.
