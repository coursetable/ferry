He has also gone beyond the boundaries of the syllabus to even give additional.information about Sanskrit as a language and interesting details about it which made the lesson far more enlightening. Perhaps slides can be shown to add more visual flavour to the class discussions. ",

            "\u00a0I will certainly recommend this course as this is a world of several tenets where we learn about history mythology, literature and even the politics of the different regions at different points of time. It enables us to share our perspectives which further broadens our understanding of these texts which enrich our minds through a variety of genres. ",
