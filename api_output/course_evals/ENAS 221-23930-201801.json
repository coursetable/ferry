            "\u00a0I learned about the scientific qualities of different art materials that artists use including paints, stone, paper, and plaster. I also learned about the qualities of color, and the effects of light aging photos. All of our units introduced me to different ways the art conservators are working to protect pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the physical properties of art materials and we had an insight into the area of art conservation as well. ",
            "\u00a0Excel, science of colors and art\r\nProduction/maintenance. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview into relevant scientific  principles involved in artistic production and conservation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic concepts in regards to art conservation. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really cool course where you get to learn a lot of skills that can be applied to much else besides analyzing the material properties of art. It teaches advanced problem solving engineering skills and it's just really fun. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of how materials are used in artworks as well as the ways one can manipulate them, how they deteriorate or how they are damaged etc. The science we learned was pretty in-depth but very specific like many snapshot close-ups of different fields of science. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the materials that compose art objects--just as offered. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well et up in the way it had lectures each week that connected to the labs on friday. However, sometimes I felt a bit lost in the homework assignments. Overall a good course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely disorganized. It was confusing to follow what was being asked of us, we didn't know what was due or when, and it seemed like the professors were pretty unprepared some of the labs and just teaching the class in general. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect as is ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting but the lectures were occasionally too technical or too broad. The labs were interesting but were slightly too long. ",
            "\u00a0This class was phenomenal. The lectures were interesting and would set the foundation for what we were learning about in class that particular week. Then the labs would build off of what was talked about in lecture so that we could physically engage with what we learned about that particular week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is relatively new, so some things could be ironed out in terms of scheduling and future planning, but you can tell that Paul and Kate really care about this and spent so much time on this course, so it will only get better. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great. I wish the lab had been optional because it was a large amount of class time for no additional credit. The labs were at times enjoyable but other times were less helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well designed, the professors are both awesome - very knowledgeable, helpful and clear. They really went out of their way for students. Perfect for non-science majors, although I'm not honestly sure how useful the content would be in daily life, it was very interesting and deepened my appreciation of art and understanding of how the world works. This was the first semester the class was offered, which was likely the reason why we didn't have a concrete schedule for the whole semester in the syllabus, but in future years I think it would be very helpful to know what kind of workload is upcoming in the weeks ahead of time.  It could also be improved by being taught in a different classroom - ours was too hot and it was impossible to see the board unless you sat in the first 3 rows. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun labs, decent lectures, course material is important to learn for art historians\r\nWeaknesses: readings were not worthwhile "

            "\u00a0Yes, this class was very interesting and fun. if you are interested in art and feel a bit lost looking for a science credit, this class is perfect! It is the right level of engagement of scientific elements, but also very interesting and relevant to how art conservation is so important. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you are interested in art and want to know more about the process of creating it and the materials with which it is created, but there is a science component to it, and the class is very disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course if you're interested in a multi-disciplinary approach to art studies but overall needs to be slightly more cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS!!! IT'S AWESOME!!! I LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Even though I was someone who was super intimidated by the fact I had to take a science credit, this class was a blessing. The material is incredibly interesting and I learned so much about the science behind the materials used to make art in a way that wasn't super overwhelming or intimidating. It's changed how I look at art, and I feel like I can really appreciate all that goes into making artwork so much more now. Kate and Paul are both great, and even though the labs are 3 hours long, I really didn't mind because they were always enjoyable and enhanced the material. Seriously, regardless of your science background, I recommend Materials Science of Art to everyone--I learned a ton and it was hands-down the funnest course I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0VERY low-workload science credit. If that's what you're looking for, then totally go for it. I felt that this course covered a lot in terms of breadth but not depth, and as a result, I don't feel like I gained that much. The class was definitely cool though; we had some neat guest speakers and went on a few tours including a trip to the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage 10/10 would recommend. Kate and Paul are generally extremely well-organized and really want each student to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a humanities major seeking a science credit. I thought that the material was interesting and engaging and made science enjoyable to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, I took it as an engineering elective, and it is probably the best one out there. Super fun, and I really learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Only if the subject really fascinates you. The emphasis on scientific properties was higher than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was the easiest Science credit I'd ever heard of or experienced. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone looking for a science credit or someone who is interested in art. I fit both of those categories so it was perfect. The workload is light, class and lab are interesting and fun. I will say that if you skip lecture and try to learn the content from Paul's slides, that won't be a good strategy - the slides are not self-explanatory. The exams were very manageable (we were allowed a cheat-sheet in both). We had a fascinating trip to West Campus at the end of the course, where we saw art conservationists at work - if you're into that stuff, and if they do it again, it could be a highlight. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great for art history majors -- art world interviewers are impressed by science, and it's good to have an appreciation for conservators. "
