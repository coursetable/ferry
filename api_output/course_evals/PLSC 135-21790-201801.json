            "\u00a0I thought critically about journalism and its complexities during conflict. ",
            "\u00a0I learned significantly how journalists report and write about conflicts and how this impacts the interpretation and consumption of this conflict media. I also learned how to critically analyze journalism by asking important questions regarding the material at hand. ",
            "\u00a0You get to engage with many journalistic texts, which, if you love journalism, makes Media & Conflict an amazing experience of a class. I found the texts to be so interesting and it was almost like a book club with Professor Wood. \r\nIt is a small discussion section, so you are really able to dissect the texts with the other students and Professor Wood, who is deeply insightful. ",
            "\u00a0A whole new way to critically read news. Wood did a great job challenging us and leading a discussion in which we developed our own interpretations of the readings ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read a media piece critically and the role that media plays in our everyday lives. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better consumer of journalism through this course, and became much more aware of the different approaches writers can take to conflict reporting. It also made me think more critically about my own writing and how I want my work to be read by my audience. The readings also gave me a lesson on military history and how media has changed over its course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strength: the readings were pretty interesting and the debates about op-eds and perspective were fascinating. The weakness generally was that the conversations were relatively unstructured and it didn't always feel like we were able to ground our discussion in any serious content. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the texts we read in class, though I wish we would have read more of the recent journalism and more articles in general, as opposed to novels/travelogues, etc. I also would have enjoyed a larger focus on the conflicts themselves as opposed to going so deeply into one small section of a journalist's piece, though I understand this was the focus of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The thing I would change is that you have very little information as to how you should write your midterm paper and final 13+ page essay. There is no official prompt, so you choose what you want to write about and meet with Professor Wood for a meeting and you just write. It is not that structured, which is nice if you like freedom but difficult if you need more structure. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion could be more rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class discussions presented challenging questions that pushed me to think very differently about journalism than I was used to. However, it was easy for a large part of the class to be unengaged and during a few sessions, our discussions suffered from that. I also expected to do more writing and get more practice with applying the techniques we were discussing. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It was alright. I wouldn't rave about it but it was interesting and pretty laid back. A lot of reading but besides the two papers, not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. As consumers of journalism, I thinks its important to think more critically about what youre reading, which this class teaches you to do. The readings are interesting, too, because you get a brief opportunity to learn more about a bunch of different conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in journalism more than discussing conflict media.  I was more interested in talking about the conflicts and the media discussing them as opposed to the method in which journalists write, which made this class a little less interesting for me. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to anyone who loves journalism -- reading it or writing it. You really get into the class what you put in, which is a great thing if you are engaging with all of the texts. Otherwise you can sit through the class without saying a single word - which some people did. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Wood is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone interested in the ethics of journalism and the challenges inherent in conflict reporting. The readings are very interesting and unlike anything you'll likely encounter in other courses. "
