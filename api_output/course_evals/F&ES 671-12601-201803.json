            "\u00a0This course was awesome in lots of ways, but particularly in the way that we left the course with such tangible skills. My plant field identification is so much better than when I entered, which is exactly why I signed up for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Prior to taking this course, I was not aware of the floristics approach to dendrology/natural history, and this class completely changed how I view natural landscapes. Moreover, I learned so much about the taxonomy and evolutionary relatedness of different plants. I feel that I have walked away from this course with a plethora of knowledge that I can directly apply to my work in the field and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about phylogenetic systematics, the natural history and relationships of woody plant species, ad how to identify woody plants in temperate North America. In addition to learning to identify 100+ specific plants, I learned the major temperate plant families and the morphological/ ecological traits used to identify and group woody plant species. I also learned about the ecosystems where various plants exist and what sort of woody plants to expect to find in each. ",
            "\u00a0Learned trees! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify around 120 trees and shrubs based on field traits, and I also learned about the types of environments these trees and shrubs like to grow in. ",
            "\u00a0I got introduced to the basic concepts of phylogony. I learned to identify trees in NE. ",

            "\u00a0It's a bummer that the course is so weather dependent, and we got rained out a few times. That can really be changed, but it's too bad. The awesome field trips are a major strength. ",
            "\u00a0From the syllabus to the field trips, this course is incredibly well designed. Each week builds on the weeks before it to provide additional and deeper insights into the material. At the beginning of the semester, I had no idea how one could possible identify a twig to the species level, but by the end, I was amazed that it was no only possible, but that it came naturally. This is certainly a testament to how well structured and effective the course is. The weekly quizzes and field cards were very helpful in helping us stay on top of the material. However, the final project did not benefit my learning as much as the other assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fantastic class. It was a terrific educational experience (Yale at its finest) and a deeply enriching experience. My only suggestion for improvement is to do with field trip scheduling. This semester, the class's Tuesday field trips, which are crucial to learning the material, were rained out multiple times. I think it would be great if there were several Fridays (or other days) reserved as make-up days/ rain days in advance at the start of the semester, so that -- if it rains during class time -- the class will be cancelled that day and taught outside on the next rain day. I struggled to learn as much on the inside days and think a solution like this could be helpful. Most importantly, this class was amazing and Marylse is a profoundly gifted instructor. I wholeheartedly recommend it and will miss it in the spring. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor very committed to student achievement ",
            "\u00a0This was by far my favorite class of the semester. Marlyse's passion and enthusiasm are infectious and she is incredibly knowledgeable about New England plant communities. The quizzes every week are a very effective way of ensuring students are continually studying the species, which is really important for this particular class. \r\nOne disappointment of the class was how often our field trips were cancelled by incessant Connecticut rain. I don't know if anything could be done about this without significantly impacting both the instructor's and student's time outside of class, but I was disappointed to not get to hike in the Berkshires or visit Hammonasset Beach with Marlyse. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that every student was very engaged in the class. We were encouraged to ask questions at any time. The design of the weekly quizzes encourage us to study every week and we did not procrastinate right before final.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that international students may find it difficult to follow. Some of the terms learned were Latin and others were very specific terminology. Non-native speakers could be hard to follow what the instructor says just listening to the instructor during class. Having a handout before each class with descriptions of the species would be better. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great, we unfortunately were subject to some bad weather, but overall the small group setting made this course really great. "

            "\u00a0If you sign up for the class then definitely put in the time, because a little bit of studying and prep goes a long way for this course and if you want to know plants then you will be so glad you did it! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn the flora and fauna of New England and how to apply floristics more broadly, then definitely take this course! It is incredible engaging, informative, and fun, and Marlyse is the best instructor around. ",
            "\u00a0This is a truly fantastic class. It will enrich your life, deepen your appreciation/ knowledge/ understanding of trees, and change how you see the world. It was a terrific educational experience -- Yale at its finest. Marlyse is a profoundly gifted instructor. I would take any class that she teaches. ",
