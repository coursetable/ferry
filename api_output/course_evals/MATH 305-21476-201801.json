With the extra time we had, we also covered projection, convolution, and differential equations, but I'm pretty sure those extra topics will change from year to year. ",
            "\u00a0This course furthered my general math knowledge. It provided practice with the language and subtleties of set theory, which will surely be helpful for future math courses. I also learned the basics of measure theory, including outer measure, lebesgue measure, measurable functions, and L^1 and L^2 spaces. We also learned the complex formulation of Fourier series, and touched briefly upon differential equations. I thought this course would resemble calculus as I knew it a bit more, but the approach was quite theoretical and, at times, abstract. While I learned the basics of several topics, I feel that I never grasped the complexities of them; the methods for completing proofs, the subtle differences in theorems and notation, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Real analysis is not exciting, but it's important stuff.  The class was super easy in the beginning but then suddenly got nearly impossible to follow as soon as the material got more complicated. ",

            "\u00a0The course was a zig-zag train ride into hell. We never knew what we were learning, and as the course went on we seemed to deviate from our track more and more. The textbook helped in grounding Professor Levit, but this course was still incredibly hectic. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is really cool, useful, and accessible. Problem sets and exams were fair and the right level of challenging. The textbook is good on some topics but not great on others, and although we used other textbooks towards the end, I think splitting time between that textbook and another more evenly would help the course. The differential equations material at the end was also a bit rushed, so I think we could have gotten more out of seeing a more advanced topic in Fourier series or projections instead. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-structured and covered an interesting selection of topics. However, expositions were often unclear or riddled with mistakes. Also, the feedback on the homework was often minimal and rather late. ",

            "\u00a0The material overall was interesting, particularly the applications we did toward the end of the class, like the isoperimetric inequality/Gibb's phenomenon/Von-Neumann's ergodic theorem, but the beauty was often hidden beneath technical proofs of basic concepts. The class was also pretty disorganized, and I never felt like I knew where we were going. I would have liked the professor to be more prepared for class, and to take time to finish proofs. ",
            "\u00a0The class is rather dull but necessary. A better teacher would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the coverage of the course was thoughtful and judicious. The material can feel a little dry at the beginning, but once you get to Fourier series, it all comes together rather nicely. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the peer tutor and the textbook used for this course. The peer tutor held review sessions twice a week which vastly helped my understanding of the material. The book was also easy to follow and made it easy to reference lectures given in class. On the topic of lectures, I'd say that's where this course was lacking. Often times, the proofs of theorems seemed to drag on forever and there were often mistakes that needed to be pointed out. On multiple occasions, the proofs were completed by email the next day. I also felt that the explanations of the proofs were unnecessarily complex since when read over in the textbook, they were often clearer than what was presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was relatively easy to follow in that it primarily followed the book, with a few excursions from it. I think that was a strength and a weakness. It was easy to go back and review the material after lecture, but I feel as though we may have missed out on other interesting subjects because we focused on the book so much. I would like to see a more creative approach to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the problem sets, which did a good job demonstrating what aspects of the lectures would be most important to know how to use and also helped me understand how to work through proofs. In general, I felt that the material covered in the course was interesting and it moved at a good pace. The things I thought could be improved were logistic, in particular, the speed with which problem sets were graded. Towards the end of the semester we did not receive problem sets back for several weeks and it was difficult to know how I was doing in the course without seeing that feedback. I also thought the final exam in particular was too difficult for the level of proofs we had been doing on problem sets and on the midterm, so even though I felt like I progressed over the course of the semester it made it difficult for me to look back positively on the course. ",
            "\u00a0The exams weren't the greatest, but otherwise the class was pretty much exactly what a real analysis course should be. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is great. After taking the course I feel that the topics are central to, or at least valuable to, a degree in Mathematics. However, the course structure and teaching style made for an unnecessarily challenging experience. Professor Levit routinely lectured directly from the course textbook (Real Analysis, Beals), and even then was often unsuccessful at completing proofs correctly or answering questions competently. Since the lectures were almost a dictation of the text, the text provided little support; each section was rarely more than two pages in length, and contained just the relevant theorems and barebone proofs. While many students did seem able to follow his lectures, I found them to be complicated, filled with minute detail, and uninspired. A more experienced professor would have made this course much more successful, meaningful, and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0As a required course for the math major, MATH 305 basically does its job. I learned the fundamentals of measure theory, and some interesting other topics were covered as well. However, the lectures were disappointing in format and presentation. They were hard to follow, and Professor Levit almost always failed to teach clearly or even correctlyeasily more than half of the proofs he gave in class were incorrect or incomprehensible, even when he was teaching directly from a textbook, and had to be corrected later on, or were left incorrect.

It's really cool material that is essential for other areas of math (applied or otherwise), and the variety of topics covered is very enjoyable. As long as you have seen very basic analysis (types of convergence, open/closed sets) before, I also found it fine to take without 300/301. ",

But note that, at least this year, the classes were often extremely confusing, guidance was limited, and psets/exams were returned 5+ weeks after we turned them in. In short, unless a lot has changed, I would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a math major you should take it. It's fine. Arie's pretty bad. The material's not glamorous but it gets the job done. As in all math classes, TA sessions will save your life. ",

This course has the potential to be a really interesting math class, but it's pretty contingent on who the professor is. ",

For me, it was a somewhat difficult course and though I think the subject matter was interesting, it would have been more interesting if I had a passion for analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in math and who has experience with higher level math courses, but it is not a course to be taken just for fun. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a math major, you really should take it, but you already knew that.  If you're not a math major, but you're interested in learning some analysis, I would recommend taking complex (MATH 310) instead, but this is also good. ",
            "\u00a0Depending on who's teaching, you should or should not take this course. With Professor Levit I had a challenging time in lecture and attempting psets. The content, though, is quite interesting (and challenging!) and with a competent professor I'm sure would make for a great course. ",
            "\u00a0As a core course for the math major, MATH 305 basically does its job. I learned some things about real analysis, and Professor Levit also covered some other interesting topics, particularly Fourier analysis and ergodic theory. However, I would strongly caution against taking this class with Arie Levit if you can help it. As a lecturer, he is extremely unclear; his lectures were often impossible to follow and were almost always riddled with errors. He had a hard time answering questions in class, and in general did not provide the strong foundation in real analysis that I had hoped to acquire. "
