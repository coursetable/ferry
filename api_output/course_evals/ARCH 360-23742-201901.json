            "\u00a0Urban Lab allowed me to hone my research methods within architecture and urbanism. Like the last semester of Urban Lab, it also provided a space in which I could meld more personal interests and artistic pursuits within a more structured, architectural framework. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the complexities and connections that exist in our urbanized world through the lenses of various \"remote\" sites. ",
            "\u00a0Skills - I learned to make strong narratives and presentations. I learned Adobe Premier and video editing from found clips. Most of the other skills used in this class were already taught by Part 1 of Urban Lab (City Making, fall semester) \r\nKnowledge - Got to dive deep into an urban subject, and this was very enjoyable. \r\nInsights - Design in the age of the anthropocene is influenced by many forces. Loved seeing my classmates work and learning about various sites and how climate change and complex human systems are shaping them. ",
            "\u00a0This class helps you learn what self-guided research in architecture can entail. Good exercise in learning to produce narratives of the city. ",
            "\u00a0Urban Lab II was above all an excellent introduction to the practice of researching and creating work about a single topic over a long period of time: the course was organized as an incremental semester-long individual project on a single site (of which each student in the class had their own). It was a very useful experience to feel more comfortable doing independent research and developing a large body of coordinated work, especially in anticipation of the upcoming thesis project. Keeping track of sources, making projects in conversation with one another, and writing and speaking about them are very valuable skills put to work in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course had me research a remote site and explore the ways that it was connected to a global urban network. We were able to try out various forms of media, like ideograms, videos, maps, and others. The course ended with an exhibition in which we presented our semester's research. We also went on a trip to Nevada. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skills in Illustrator and Photoshop over the semester, just by generating various products that I wanted to make. I also improved my ability to visualize and spatialize complex ideas that came out of my research. Urban Lab II was very good practice in learning to visually present research, ideas, and visions. \r\n\r\nI also started to think more deeply about urbanism, what it entails, and the social, political, and environmental consequences of humans attempting to urbanize far-off and unforgiving places. I also improved my presentation skills over the course of the semester, as we were giving long (approximately 10 minute) presentations of our work. "

            "\u00a0This course had little set curriculum.  So, while Joyce and the TFs were wonderful advisors and resources, it was rather easy to feel like one was just floating out in the void. I would have loved some readings (I ended up looking at a lot of the books Joyce had on hold which was really helpful) and more lectures or at least structured discussions.\r\n\r\nJoyce also found great guest critics who always provided great advice and nuanced critique on our projects ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be enriching but also painful, because organizing one's thoughts around this topic was difficult! Guidance in research would have made the semester smoother and more effective, I believe. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushed us to think about complex issues, and explore how to represent them visually. It could have had more incremental projects to keep us more engaged during lull points in the semester. We also could have gotten more feedback throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - (1) The hands down best thing about this course was the opportunity to focus deeply on one site throughout the semester. This is rare in an undergraduate course, but lent a depth of focus and insight that was unparalleled. This also allowed for a more self-driven exploration. (2) Second, the chance to present so frequently definitely helped students get more comfortable speaking in public, which is so important as we venture into the real world. (3) The trip to Nevada had a great tempo of planned and *unplanned time*. It felt more effective than some other Urban Lab trips, because the time to reflect on the sites we saw (Nuclear Testing site, Desert Land sculpture, etc) made these lessons more personalized and internalizable. Many of my peers and I enjoyed the time we had to reflect to ourselves during the long drives, or later that night  it was an opportunity to really figure out what we would take away from this experience, and incorporate it into our work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - (1) Often felt like the key skill we learned was the art of the presentation; most of the lectures and guest visits revolved around how to tell a good story. This is so crucial, but many of my peers and I felt like there was the opportunity to slide in *other* lessons: demonstrations of other forms of analysis (site analysis, historical analysis, library research, etc) might have added depth and variety to our research strategies. Overall, integration of more new skills would have been great. (2) Time management in-class was hard. We were always running out of time to cover everyones work. Maybe the class needs to be smaller. (3)  It felt like one of the best elements of Fall urban lab was the opportunity to see our peers present. But most of Thursday class was lecture and *very* brief individual feedback sessions. This limited opportunities to hear from and learn from peers, which is a valuable kind of experience. (4) The kinds of analysis I saw my peers use became a little repetitive week-to-week... Again, it would have been great to have lectures or training on *achievable* but different analytic strategies. For example, most students in the class dont know how to script. But scripting may have generated interesting insights. 3D modeling some site feature could have been cool too, Etc. ",
            "\u00a0More group discussion would be good to create more cohesion between projects, but the emphasis on research makes it difficult to make time for that in class. More readings! ",
            "\u00a0The individual nature of the project is the source of both the course's strengths and its weaknesses. It was empowering and productive to work on a single broad topic for the entire semester and to be the only person in the class working on that topic: it forced a lot of independent thinking and self-directed research. However, I wish I had been able to take greater advantage of the thoughts of my classmates and the insights of my professor-- because each person was working on a different site, there were few opportunities for us to all talk together about our work. We did no research or reading as a class, so group discussions were rare and class time was instead developed to short individual meetings. These were helpful, but I would have liked to feel more like a collaborative seminar than advisory office hours; some of the best classes were our few lectures or large group conversations. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the variety of media explored in the course and the level of research encouraged. The weaknesses were the often very unclear expectations for the course and feedback. It also would have been nice to have done readings for the trip or had discussions about our trip to Nevada, and to have debriefed and discussed it more formally while we were traveling. I feel like we could have had some really fruitful discussions if time had been allotted towards that. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave students flexibility to dive into what they found fascinating about a topic, which was a strength. Allowing us to change directions and find new angles was also helpful. \r\n\r\nI appreciate that the course is research based, but I think the first research stage could be more structured and more formal. It might be helpful if the professor at least outlined expectations on how to properly do research, keep track of information, cite sources, and continue citing those sources. Those are good academic standards that I think would have increased the academic integrity of everyone's work. A lot of my research was informal and informally recorded - which I definitely regretted later in the semester. \r\n\r\nAlso, Las Vegas was awesome! I learned a lot on that trip. It was wonderfully organized, so fun, and one of the highlights of my year. The Nevada National Security Site and Desert Day were amazing. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this course. It really pushed me to think about complex issues and what the role of a designer can be in fixing them. ",
            "\u00a0yes. The class was a fantastic opportunity to immerse yourself in urban questions around a concentrated project. the class did NOT feel \"all over the place,\" because of this focus. Joyce is a fantastic lecturer. I will say, though, that you get as much out of it as you put in. It was clear that some people put in a lot less effort, with little personal return. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you get what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is ready and excited to do independent work and be responsible for the toil and reward of that. I found the class to be very productive and engaging because I was proud of my self-directed research and felt capable of learning and producing work with minimal input on the theoretical side (most of our feedback was very practical and project-based). However, classmates of mine who wanted more to be taught in a traditional sense, with readings and lectures and group work, were frustrated. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student in general. They should be interested in learning about a new site and thinking about this location in new ways. I would also recommend starting early with assignments as they end up developing better the longer time spent thinking about it. However, they should also feel comfortable reaching out for feedback often because it is a bit difficult to get it throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! It is definitely an interesting course that will push you to come to your own conclusions about our \"urban world\". I appreciate that Joyce doesn't shove any answers in your face, but encourages you to find your own answers. You'll receive good feedback that will help you improve your work, and you'll likely be inspired by other students. To get the most out of this course, you definitely need self-motivation and determination. ",
