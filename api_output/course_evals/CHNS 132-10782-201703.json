            "\u00a0Lots of Chinese characters, grammar, and mechanics. Insight into proper pronunciation as well. ",
            "\u00a0I scored a zero on the first daily quiz because I can only recognize basic level Chinese words, and write very very few characters. Luckily, grades for the class don't go into effect until a few weeks in to allow enough time to adjust. The improvement I made in this class was jaw-dropping--I went from knowing nearly zero characters to learning how to write about 300 characters in a semester. My speaking and listening skills have skyrocketed, and I am very proud of my personal growth. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my Chinese reading and writing skills and abilities significantly through this course. ",
            "\u00a0over the course of the semester, my written and spoken Chinese have both definitely improved. I'm conscious of myself using new vocabulary words and grammar structure in my everyday sentences and feel more comfortable conversing in the language. my accents have also become more accurate, even though I had a pretty standard mandarin accent before. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my reading and writing in Chinese, as well as learned bits of Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0learn to read, speak, write chinese better ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to write basic Chinese characters and say moderately advanced Chinese sentences. Also covered intermediate-level Chinese grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the extremely useful skill set of how to learn a language.\r\n\r\nI developed insights into my own culture that I did not possess prior to this class.\r\n\r\nI learned knowledge of various vocabulary and grammar structures which has in turn made my spoken Chinese better. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese writing and reading skill increased tremendously! I also lgained experience speaking Chinese in conversation, and it didnt feel awkward struggling in a language. "

            "\u00a0Excellent course for learning, and the repetition was helpful for learning. The discussions were a good forum for practicing speaking, and were definitely a highlight. The repetitive nature of the class did get tedious by the end, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class size! Small sections really put an emphasis on conversation and bonding! \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we did in-class grammar worksheets instead of merely going over the concepts verbally. It would be nice to have handouts to refer to for grammar points. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that it really helped me learn more Chinese due to its daily nature and the structure of the course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the lessons cover a lot of different topics, and the professors manage to strike a good balance of assigning enough work so you keep up with the class but not too much so you're dead. the professors are also very understanding if other circumstances in your life-ex. a big test, you feeling ill, etc.- pop up and prevent you from attending class or completing an assignment. this is probably the class where i felt closest to my teachers as people. \r\nweaknesses: more of the course could be discussion and debate based, and as I really want to expand my writing vocabulary, I'm hoping that we could be taught more vocab for those discussions that we are not necessarily pressured to be tested upon but can simply incorporate over time into our speech and writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great at testing only what was taught in class, as the tests and essays followed exactly what we covered in class, which was great for leveling the playing field for students that start at different levels. ",
            "\u00a0good, fun course. not too intense ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught five times a week, every weekday morning. The class is small, only about 14 kids maximum, and has two equally skilled teachers switching off weeks of teaching. This environment forces significant participation with both the reading and writing parts of the class and really encourages growth. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that it meets everyday and is quite intensive.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was the lack of connection between all the Chinese students in terms of interaction. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of time commitment but it helped me learn better. "

            "\u00a0YES! If you want to learn Chinese and already have some sort of a background, this class is absolutely fantastic. Your reading, writing, and speaking will all improve both quickly and dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0I can't recommend this course highly enough. It was reassuring to be in a class that came from a similar background: ie we could all somewhat speak and somewhat listen but were nearly illiterate in reading and writing. This is also a class that grades based off of your improvement, as the professors are aware that everyone starts off at a different level. Overall this class is a lot of fun, moves quickly enough, and will improve your Chinese speaking/writing/listening/reading skills so much! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I believe it can significantly improve one's Chinese abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you're a native speaker looking to improve your Chinese! the two professors - liu laoshi and chan laoshi - are both very enthusiastic and caring and the subject matter for me has invited interesting discussion about what it means to be chinese-american. as the lessons reflect different aspects of chinese culture that I identify, as did many of my classmates, it was actually an interesting space to return to every day that reminded me of home and family and asked me to think about my values, etc. moreover, obviously a daily chinese class would improve your chinese! the workload is not excessive - you get used to the daily homework pretty quickly - but the pace can move quickly, especially at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0While this class is difficult, it is extremely rewarding and fantastic for developing Chinese reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0highly recommend if you need to take chinese. Liu laoshi and chan laoshi are the best! Workload not too much if you pay attention in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Chinese 132 to any person who speaks Chinese at home but can not write. The course is designed so that even students who dont know any characters can immediately jump in and keep up with the class. The class is excellent, and I learned more in one semester than I did in two years of high school Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a fantastic course and has great teachers. If you are looking to learn Chinese, this is the right course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The professors are fantastic, and they really support you. "
