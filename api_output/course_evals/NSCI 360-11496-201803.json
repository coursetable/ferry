            "\u00a0This class provides a fascinating introduction to the most common psychiatric disorders and syndromes. The material is accessible to anyone with a very basic background in neuroscience, and lecture material reflects the most current understanding of the biological mechanisms involved. ",
            "\u00a0More about the underlying neuromechanisms behind psychological disorders ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the various levels in which a psychopathology can manifest. We learned how to approach very intriguing research questions from genetic, molecular and circuit levels of analysis. Overall a very insightful course about many different types of psychopathologies. Very glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Very good, cohesive overview of the neuroscience basis of the most psychiatric disorders, as well as a good glimpse on behavioral genetics. ",
            "\u00a0Good and broad understanding of many disorders. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a solid background in a broad range of psychiatric disorders, their underlying mechanisms, their presentation, and their treatments. It was nice to see biological and clinical applications of the broad principles taught in introductory neuroscience classes. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a survey of clinical psychiatric disorders. Each lecture discussed a disorder and went into the neural, emotional, and environmental causes of each, reviewing relevant studies. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered a deep understanding of the neuroscience behind different psychiatric disorders, including cutting-edge research. The course discussed disorders' mechanisms along with the mechanisms of treatment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a TON about the brain basis of mental illness and disease. It was a great class: interesting material and fantastic professor. ",

            "\u00a0I think the readings are often repetitive to the material in class and maybe this is on purpose to review or go into more depth, but I would like more interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the amount of information that the lectures were able to cover in terms of breadth. Professor Cannon's lectures were pretty standard and well organized, although sometimes the powerpoints were too wordy... Liked how he took questions during lecture and asked us questions to make it a bit more interactive-- the cartoons and images on ppts were also fun. Just wish there wasn't so much memorization involved in the midterm exams. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating lectures, *optional* reading, and fair exams. Truly a great course if you are interested in the subject matter (which it's hard not to be). Prof. Cannon is an excellent lecturer and his slides are very clear and easy to study. Even though it was a lecture course, the class was small and Prof. Cannon encouraged participation. The only weakness - the guest lectures - they were much less organized and much less clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Pretty standard course. Ty seems like a great guy and tries to make the class easy going and fun. Nothing too hard. The exams are fair and having them be NOT cumulative is great. It really lets you focus on the 8 or so lectures you've learned. The essay was also doable. Nothing to stress over\r\n\r\nWeakness: If I had to choose one lecture that was the weakest, it would be the molecular genetics one (early on.) I think it was a bit muddled and I still to this day can't quite make out what terms like heritability and permanence mean. They aren't super key to the class itself but often other lectures make reference to the levels of genetic heritability of a trait among other things and without a good foundation, it kind of went over my head. ",
            "\u00a0Well-presented, although I wish I could have taken notes on the slides instead of separately. ",
            "\u00a0the class was pretty boringly taught ",
            "\u00a0This course was particularly well-organized, and Prof. Cannon is clear in his expectations. Further, the class is open to questions and hypothesizing from the students, making the learning experience more intimate despite the lecture style. In addition, Prof. Cannon answers all questions with certainty and authority, and he is one of few professors I've had who mean it when they say \"We'll get to that in just a few slides.\" He works hard for us, presents material in a manageable way, and approaches the subject with the lightheartedness necessary to make a potentially maudlin topic interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first year the course was taught at an upper level. I enjoyed that the course went somewhat into depth with the neuroscience, but would have appreciated a deeper dive in this matter rather than more general surveys during the beginning of the lecture, e.g. obesity BMI during the eating disorders lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was pretty good. I think the course's content is pretty self explanatory and the content is well delivered, so I'm unsure how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great lecturer, reachable TA, and fascinating material. \r\nWeaknesses: unreasonably strict grading rubric for the exams. You essentially had to memorize thirty things, recall all thirty things out of thin air (because you were still expected to put them all down even if the question didn't actually ask you to), and if you forgot one of thirty, be deducted two points out of ten. ",
            "\u00a0All good, no weakness ",
            "\u00a0The exams require a lot more memorization than understanding. Doing well depends on remembering specific names.\r\nOverall very interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would love if there were a more concrete way we could engage with the course readings (i.e., reading responses/class discussions). However, overall this was a really fascinating and well-structured/taught course. ",
            "\u00a0The test format was very inconsistent. The multiple choice sometimes would be so specific or nuanced that you had to memorized every word on every slide of every powerpoint in order to do well. Having a comprehensive understanding of the material still felt like not enough to do well on the exams. The short answer were also graded unfairly. The professor would take off points if we did not answer questions that he did not ask. We were told that we were being graded on a rubric for the short answers, but were never told what that rubric was. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Course was a really good intro to a huge range of psychiatric disorders-- I know a lot more about the diseases now and their mechanisms. If you're looking for very in-depth coverage of one specific disease though or non-psychiatric disorders, that's not really what this class is ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a really great, very interesting, low work class. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone who already has a background in neuroscience or who is interested and willing to work hard to understand the biological concepts. PSYC 160 (The Human Brain) is a prerequisite but this class doesn't really draw on concepts from that class; most of the material introduced is new unless you're familiar with neurotransmitters, the brain, and systems relating to them. There is a steep learning curve if you're not familiar with the material and the pacing of the class is fast since each lecture is a different topic, but it is a good class. I took it for a science credit and psychology credit, but I probably would have taken it credit/d and still stayed in the class if not for needing the science credit. The topics for the most part are engaging and you're bound to find something you're interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fair exams. No Final. Two-page paper. Lectures aren't dense. Interesting stuff. All around a great class (5th credit gut?) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for another student. Even if you do not have an extensive background in neuroscience, this is an excellent course for those that wish to understand the neuroscientific basis of psychiatric disorders. ",
            "\u00a0no, there is a lot of information that you need to know and lectures can be pretty dry ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to take whether you're a neuroscience major or not. Its survey style approach keeps you learning at a level where material is interesting but not too complicated. The workload is entirely manageable (three in-class exams and a short final paper), and if you study for the exams, you will be fine (though you will always have to guess at a few multiple choice questions). Prof. Cannon is a great lecturer and really makes the course worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great but very difficult. It was hard to figure out what they were looking for on exams and even after taking three, I still don't know how to get a good score. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in clinical neuroscience. I thought Dr. Cannon was engaging and made some heavy topics more palatable. I always enjoyed going to class and learned a lot about disorders that I previously thought I knew the neural bases of after taking a separate psychopharmacology course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. I think it is a great course for anyone interested in neuroscience, psychopharmacology, or abnormal psychology. Dr. Cannon is a phenomenal professor, and he really cares about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I would consider taking it Credit/D to avoid getting caught up in the grading issues. The material is fascinating, useful, and important, and Dr. Cannon is a delightful person and lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0YESYESYESYES ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! A great survey connecting what you've learned in Abnormal Psychology to what you've learned in the Human Brain. Great for those interested in clinical psychology, psychopharmacology, and psychiatry. Professor Cannon is very knowledgeable and a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if students are interested in the psychiatric disorders. You definitely learn a lot, but be prepared to study extensively and excessively for the midterms. ",
            "\u00a0No. This course seems to be. Rergurgitated lecture on abnormal psychology and disorders without acknowledging it. Furthermore, the material itself was straightforward (and eventually very repititive which became a drag) but to compensate the tests were unreasonably graded. Would not recommend this class "
