Dr. D is also a very nice professor!\r\nWeaknesses: for the post-lab assignments, the material and rules appeared scattered across multiple documents, so you had to go through them all and figure out what was expected for the assignments by consolidating the information. Also some TAs graded harsher than other TAs on the writing assignments on small details, so perhaps consistency among grading would be nice. ",

At times it was like a wild goose chase to find exactly the information needed--and often (especially for lab reports) there are not enough examples of what a perfect lab report looks like. The TA feedback is not adequate. I asked for help on a Post Lab Assignment and was told to \"keep my head up\". ",

I also wish that the final were part practical, part written (or all practical). I feel like a 100% written exam doesn't test what we learned adequately. I liked the range of experiments and the timing of the lab. The course instructors were all fantastic and I think that they were really understanding about the fact that we are all beginners and will make mistakes. ",

It might have been helpful to have the first lab report incorporate some similar elements rather than asking different questions in a different format. ",

However, the Experimental Plan system is pretty poorly executed, and the requirements about not including too much information were so stringent that the Experimental plan ended up being pretty useless. Grading in this course felt like it had very little to do with knowledge and the grading expectations for assignments were unclear and inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the quality of the resources students have. To each have our own lab station is a real privilege that definitely heightens the ability to learn. \r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of more structural weaknesses in the course. For one the prelab EP's serve next to no purpose in their current form. While its good to get in the habit of looking of up SDS information for the chemicals we will be using in lab, if they really cared about lab safety they would just give us this information outright so we don't accidentally get incorrect info. Additionally most of the information we have to fill out in the EP's is irrelevant to the lab (like MP and BP if we aren't melting or boiling the chemical). To lose points for information that is irrelevant to the actual information just seems weird. Additionally, you can also lose lots of formatting points on EP's, which is silly because EP's aren't actually a formal scientific thing. \r\n\r\nThe post lab assignments also require massive restructuring. There are about 20 documents (hyperbole) on canvas that purport to relate to how the PL's should be formatted but none of them are actually a good rubric for us to follow. It felt like we were getting graded based off of some secret rubric that had we just been aware we could have easily implemented the arbitrary changes it required. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course in that each lab built off each other such that by the end of the course I felt I had developed many skills. Moreover, the course material went hand in hand with much of the material we were learning in the Organic Chemistry course, so it was nice to have a practical approach to chemistry while also learning about it in lecture. I think the course could be improved by having PL assignments that more accurately tested our knowledge. I feel like the TAs graded too strictly on the PL assignments in ways that did not accurately reflect our knowledge and understanding of the material. This was similar to the disastrous lab reports in General Chemistry Lab. ",

            "\u00a0I think the class was well-organized, and it was rewarding that every lab built off the previous one. All assignments were manageable, but the point system and way things were graded is extremely annoying.

Points are taken off for every single minor mistake. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is that with each assignment, despite any feedback given, there would always be new issues arising. It was very frustrating, and almost depressing at some points, as it felt like no matter how hard I tried, I was never good enough. ",

There are only two lab reports which made it much easier to understand exactly why we were using each technique. No need to worry about the yield of your product as the course was more focused on learningunderstanding the techniques, figuring out what went wrong and how to improve the next time around.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little guidance on creating lab reports. There was a document that outlined what exactly was needed in each section as well as an uploaded document about how another student's report was graded, but it would have been nice to get more than just that. As for the EPs, you sometimes get small points marked off on very small things that seem to be very subjective between TA from TA.

There are only four \"objectively\" graded things before the final, and depending on your TA, that might be great or that might be horrible for your mental well being because you never know how your grade is going to turn out. The TA grading was very inconsistent and the grade really only depends on four things since everybody is doing well on the EPs, which actually is very stressful. also, nobody ever knew what to expect on the PLA or PLB, which led to a lot of confusion and frustration when grades came out.

The largest weakness, on the other hand, is that most of the grading seems relatively subjective, making it difficult to know how to do assignments. In terms of approving this, I think that the staff should provide more examples submissions of the assignments and the TAs should, on the first day, go over expectations for every aspect of assignments like pre-lab assignments.

The course packet has very useful information, but sometimes the instructions on the later labs are less detailed or a little confusing. The course is also very lenient on mistakes, which is nice because it is the first time many of the students are performing some of the techniques involved.\r\nOne of the most outstanding weaknesses of this course is that the instructions provided for many of the assignments, especially the Post Labs, are very basic, and there is no rubric given to have an idea of what will be expected. The rubric given to the TA's seemed to ask for specific terms and ideas that, if not mentioned, greatly affected the score received. This caused great frustration when, having worked very hard on each assignment and having asked for further clarifications, the scores received were still low. Many of the grades given throughout the semester seem to be greatly subjective, with the only real objective assessment being two quizzes and a final exam. ",

I also think that the structure of the assessments was generally well designed.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest weakness of the course was the organization of information. Oftentimes, when doing assignments, I'd have to search 4-5 different places on the Canvas website to find all of the relevant information on how to complete a Post-Lab Assignment or EP. I think it would be useful for Professor DiMeglio and the TAs to maybe look through the Canvas website and reorganize the information, because it did end up affecting my grade when I didn't find or consider certain information because it was so spread out. Moreover, I think it would be useful to compare some of this information, because it sometimes is also contradictory. ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths:* Professors during lab were very helpful with conducting the experiments. They would circulate through the lab and I feel like I learned a lot from asking them, the TAs, and even my classmates, questions and gaining some hands-on, real-life experience with lab equipment and synthesis. The lab was always very clean and well laid-out and the glassware was professional grade. We werent graded on yield and were given ample time for the experiments, so during lab we had a chance to learn instead of stressing about grades (more on that later). Most materials for this course were included in the Course_packet.docx posted to Canvas at the beginning of the semester so we had time in advance to plan ahead and there were no surprise projects due on short notice. Final grade can be determined either via equal weight on pre-labs:post-labs:final exam or 100% on final exam which was ~35 question 1 hour multiple choice, which was fair with minimal tricks. If you know the material, youll do fine.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* The prelabs and post-lab reports felt like a waste. The prelabs were very frustrating since the majority of the work was copying safety data from an online database into a multipage chart in a word doc. Then the prelab grading is anal, emphasizing formatting and other minutiae. I understand safety data is an important preparation for doing the lab, but it was quite time consuming and felt like a big waste of time that could have been used for actual learning. The post-lab reports are long, redundant, have a large emphasis on formatting and procedure in place of actual chemistry, and are graded arbitrarily according to a rubric with little details that are basically impossible to prepare for and everyone does pretty poorly. I learned nothing from doing the lab reports, which are ostensibly meant as a preparation for writing actual scientific publications. However, examples given in the Guide_for_scientific_writing.docx on Canvas that we were to follow for our write up and other examples found in the literature are at odds with how the lab reports are actually graded. PLEASE make the grading rubric for the lab reports consistent with the examples, and structure the reports so they focus on the chemistry instead of formatting and procedures. ",

Perhaps more guidance on writing post lab assignments, especially in the style of the later one, would be helpful to future students. ",

While the pre-lab lectures do a good job of explaining the procedure, I had a hard time following the chemistry of the reactions. Also, I had a hard time understanding what exactly was expected of me on the post labs assignment and EPs. A rubric might benefit the students, given that often times, points were deducted on specifics that I didn't know should have been included. ",

Strengths include the accessibility of Professor DiMeglio and the teaching assistants, always encouraging questions, and the wealth of information available in the course packet and textbook. Additionally, I think that it is a strength that the the final exam is written as opposed to a lab practical, because it is a better measure of students understanding of the material, whereas a lab practical contains a certain element of chance. I think the one weakness is most of a student's grade is reliant on the strictness of their specific teaching fellow. ",

The grading of experimental plans and post-lab assignments is ridiculous (how could the average for such a simple assignment be an 80?) and there is not much transparency in terms of the methods they use to dole out such low scores. Sure, you know that you'll get a full 1/10 points off if you forget to number your EP pages, or half a point off of a perfectly labeled IR spectrum for not writing the date you took it, but the finer details of grading are really a mystery. It seems that what would otherwise be an A with reasonable effort is taken from you due to markdowns made any and everywhere for omitting \"requirements\" that are not even made clear to students before submitting the assignment. ",

The grading is completely arbitrary, the assignments are misleading, and the TAs grade according to vastly divergent criteria. As an academic/preprofessional endeavor, the experience is worthwhile; but as a CLASS (an experience that culminates in a grade and is in large part informed by grading and evaluation), it's poorly organized and generally unfair. ",

It might be helpful to get a criteria/checklist of what are some things TAs might take points off for in the EP's since points seemed to be taken off from a subjective criteria. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say the main weakness of this course is the lack of guidance I had during the writing and composition of post-lab assessments. This may have been due to my lack of reaching out to peers or my TA via email, but I would have liked more online resources in the form of an example post-lab or something along those lines. ",

One definite weakness of the course was that the expectations and rubrics for post-lab assignments were not clearly stated. For example, in post-lab B, we were expected to regurgitate specific facts from a secondary source article and were taken points off if we did not have those specific facts in our \"Introduction.\" However, it is unreasonable for everyone to use the same exact pieces of information for his or her \"Introduction.\" Perhaps the rubric could be modified to require a certain number of facts instead. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I, personally, felt unprepared for certain aspects of the lab assignments, it was altogether a very fair class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very straightforward with a linear curriculum. Lab TAs are extremely helpful. Main weakness of the course is the grading system. Although the professionalism necessary in lab reports and experimental plans is necessary, many times errors not related to organic chemistry topics themselves caused my grades to fluctuate. These errors include bibliography errors, not including page numbers on reports, poor formatting, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very straightforward. Course packet was very detailed and provided most of the necessary information. Lots of great details, I always read the course packet and felt more or less prepared for lab each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It seemed like all the TA's graded differently (which is to be expected to some degree, I understand). Grading seemed very particular (I had points taken off for the title of one of my post labs, which was \"technically correct, but not the best option.\" I truly appreciated the feedback (and have learned from it), but my title followed the format of the example and that one didn't have points taken off for it and it was something we didn't touch on in class.). Also, in my opinion this class should be worth more than 0.5 credits. By doing all the readings, EP's, Post labs, and ensuring I was prepared for lab, I spent as much time outside of class for this course as I did for courses worth 1.0 credits.\r\n\r\nIn all though, very strong and straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was well taught, but I wish we learned more actual chemistry in the lab (like how the reactions work - we got glimpses, but I feel like a lecture at the beginning of the session would have been helpful.) ",
            "\u00a0This course was organized very well. I felt that the workload was just the right amount and the laboratory work was very engaging. I think that the TA lectures could have been more engaging. The final was a comprehensive overview of our understanding. ",
            "\u00a0For pretty much every technique, we got at least two chances to practice it within the labs, which was useful. The light workload makes it much easier to keep up with other courses than it was back in gen chem. It did make things a bit difficult when we actually had to do lab reports, simply because there are many, many requirements to hit and unless they are all perfect, it's almost impossible not to lose points. There were a few times where I felt I lost points unfairly, but I did not follow up on these instances, so I don't know whether I would have received points back or not. \r\nI don't know that this lab really needs to be changed though, because it's certainly better than having a long lab report due every week. It was far less stressful than general chemistry, and for that I am thankful. ",
            "\u00a0a lot of work and harsh grading considering its only worth half a credit ",
            "\u00a0The course could improve on giving a grading rubric or at least a clue to the students on how the PLs and EPs will be graded. I found it quite stressful that I would get points off for not saying that a certain compound is specifically used in something and that I would get points off if the TA was simply not satisfied with it ",
            "\u00a0The grading system in the class feels punitive. Tiny errors that represent maybe 1% or 2% of the information detailed in a prelab or other assignment would result in point deductions of 10% or more. Students could probably receive a -300% on an assignment for doing a terrible job rather than a 0%, and deductions for writing a date as 11/15 rather than 11/15/18, or tiny semantic differences in my reflection questions than what was expected, were typically worth far more than deductions for embarrassing mistakes that actually pertained to the course materials. The comments I received showed that my scientific writing was strong, and my understanding of all the chemistry was strong, but God forbid if I didn't spend hours crafting the perfect analysis of one paragraph of a journal article about safety, because there would be hell to pay. When you lose only 5 points on an assignment for forgetting how recrystallizations work (for anyone considering the class: recrystallizations are important), but 25 points for not rephrasing an article about the importance of salicylic acid perfectly, it really felt like the importance of the subject was undermined. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the protocols for each lab were clear. Also, I'm very thankful they didn't grade on % yield, as my yields often weren't too high as a result of this being my first lab course ever. I can't think of many weaknesses. Of course, a 4 hr time block isn't super nice, but I feel like there's no way to get around that. ",

Guidance and help were very limited and I had to really reach out beyond what I felt should have been expected to get help. Help needs yo be more accessible because not everyone has taken lab before at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, the skills learned are important for furthering your scientific proficiency. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if its necessary. It isnt too difficult and the grading is fair, but it isnt that enjoyable. And, as most labs at Yale seem to be, it feels like much more work than 1/2 credit is worth. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to those that require it. While it was an interesting course, this is to be taken in conjunction with Organic Chemistry lecture, which is a very demanding course. ",
            "\u00a0It's not great, but if you have to take it you'll get through it. ",
            "\u00a0No; very poorly taught course with no guide to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Though I think most students take this course as a requirement anyway, I learned a lot and had a very pleasant experience! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was very useful for students who are taking organic chemistry. The application of the theoretical to the practical was a much-needed supplement to my understanding of the material taught in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0not if it is not required ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this if you have a choice. For all of you who took gen chem lab, at least rest assured that this is a step up. ",
            "\u00a0If you need it as a prerequisite or are interested in chemistry research, its good. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, if standardized rubrics are implemented grading forward. Otherwise, I recommend the learning the material/gaining the lab experience in a different setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, organic chem lab is a requirement for a lot of different things, and this course is a good mix of fun and not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to any student interested in science research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's definitely a great lab course. Just the post-lab assessments are really tough (to me, at least). ",
            "\u00a0Yes if required ",
            "\u00a0If you need this lab, take it. If you like organic chemistry, definitely take it. Otherwise, this is a challenging course and requires understanding of organic chemistry to truly get the most out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized with very simple assignments that follow the same format. Experiments are anxiety inducing under time constraints but are doable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was a relatively straight forward course. I always received help when I was unsure about something, which was fantastic because of the hazardous nature of the chemicals we were working with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it's not really a choice - you probably have to take it, and its a really well taught class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the translation of organic chemistry concepts to practical lab work. It was a highly enriching course and I look forward to next semester. ",
            "\u00a0As is the usual with these kinds of courses, the only people taking it will be the people who have to. However, do know that it's not as stressful as general chemistry lab. It actually does feel like the 0.5 credit course it purports itself to be, so you can relax a little. ",
            "\u00a0Only if it is required. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking organic chemistry, this is lab is good to supplement it. ",
            "\u00a0no unless you have to (much better than gen chem lab though) ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're a chem or bio major, you'll have to take this. It's not bad by any means, especially compared to the bad things I've heard about gen chem lab. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to as a requirement. Instructors are fair but much work for 0.5 credits ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and useful overall . ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not unless you have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you are interested in chemicals and learning how to use more scientific instruments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is actually more enjoyable than general chem lab. "
