            "\u00a0I learned about the physics of tsunamis, the process of fracking, and the composition of planetary atmospheres besides Earth. ",
            "\u00a0i learned a ton about issues surrounding water... a lot of these are influenced by climate change/pollution/environmental issues that  really everyone should know. wonderful SC credit. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The structure of this course was very clear, but also very repetitive. Reading responses seemed like the most valuable assignment to prove that you had done the readings, as the introductory lectures were similar in content and then the 75-min student presentations of various quality basically a summation of the readings paragraph by paragraph. Low class attendance and low class participation indicate that the style of lectures/use of in-class time could be a weakness to improve upon. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- topics covered, and the way in which class was organized. two weekly articles and a thoughtful write up.\r\nweaknesses- maybe no laptop in section policy? "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone looking for a Science credit without psets and exams. Grading is based off weekly reading responses/peer evaluations and a final paper. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course this year did not facilitate my learning, so I would not recommend it to another student who works best when they feel engaged. For students looking for a Sc credit who are interested in water and thrive with a highly structured weekly syllabus, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Our university ridiculously mandates that someone like me who has no interest in science and doesn't understand science take 2 courses in the field of science. This course is probably one of the best ways to fulfill that requirement. It's doable, the workload isn't much, and a few weeks have interesting material. I also prefer the seminar format so appreciated being able to knock out my science credit in that. ",
            "\u00a0yes! its a wonderful way to get a SC credit and still learn ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! This course is more writing-focused than you would expect for a STEM class; however, you will read a fair bit of science articles (2-3/week) and critique them via understanding their topics and strengths/weaknesses, which is still pretty difficult, so I wouldn't necessarily call this class a gut like reviews in previous years have. The class structure is great and facilitates discussion, and you will learn about water in a variety of contexts that apply both to policy and geology. The professor is also a wonderful lecturer, and gives good feedback on the draft to your final paper. "
