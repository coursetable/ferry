            "\u00a0Thanks to our amazing professor, I truly feel I was able to gain remarkable grasps on elementary parts of Korean. Basic expressions and a plethora of vocabulary alongside insight to the Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0Very basic conversational skill in Korean, basic understanding of Korean grammar, some important grammar forms and basic vocab ",
            "\u00a0I gained what I believe to be a sufficient knowledge of grammar and writing abilities in Korean, as well as beginning speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, write, and speak Korean. I think the highlight of this course was the grammar - I previously knew a little bit of informal Korean, so I didn't know any of the rules of how to conjugate or where to add particles. My reading and speaking has definitely improved as well. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have a really thorough base for my study of Korean thanks to this class. Although I still don't know that much vocab (more my fault than that of this class...) I have a really solid grounding and understanding of basic grammar. I also know a lot more about Korean culture! ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic Korean language skills, including the Korean alphabet, the grammar, at least 20 verb conjugations, particles, and other grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I had some knowledge of Korean before taking 110, so I thought this class would be mostly review, but I actually learned a lot! My speaking skills and familiarity with the grammar patterns improved from all the practice we do in class. There are also weekly language tables (*go* if you can!) that made me more comfortable with using Korean outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Solid understanding of basic Korean grammar and vocabulary with the ability to read, write, and speak. Also, learned a lot about Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal of Korean vocabulary and grammar in addition to culture. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory and some intermediate ability to read, speak, and understand the Korean language. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me a basic introduction into conversational Korean. In a short amount of time, we learned the grammar and vocabulary needed to describe daily activities, transportation, items, etc. We also learned a lot about Korean culture through the presentations we had during the semester! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, write, and speak in Korean. I learned grammar of the language, as well as vocabulary, and complex sentence structures. ",
            "\u00a0Basic understandings of Koreans alphabets in order to be able to read and pronounce Korean. Students are capable to make simple self-introduction, to read numbers and time, to describe simple events with simples nouns and verbs in different tenses. I also feel more motivated to continue to learn Korean after taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0You become more acquainted with the Korean language, from basic speaking skills and writing. You develop basic conversational skills. By the end of the course, you'll be able to write paragraphs of text and have many useful phrases for everyday life in Korean. "

            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the professor.  is an incredible instructor who really took the time to get to know us and work with us to make sure we were understanding. If anything the only improvement would be to have more class time with her! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a ton of fun. It's very engaging, low-stress but rewards the effort you put in. My only complaint is that I didn't really like the textbook very much, and I wish that we didn't have to buy the workbook and the listening book, because only really used a small part of each, very sporadically, and it didn't feel very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Follows the curriculum very well; I always know what's happening in the course at all times. Professor Lee is amazing. All assignments seem fair and balanced. \r\nDon't really see many weaknesses. We learn a lot of words and it's not always clear which ones are testable and which ones are not I suppose, but on the other hand it's a language class and we should be picking up as many words as we can. ",
            "\u00a0I think the best thing about Korean 110 is the teacher. Professor Lee-Smith was extremely engaging and she taught us a lot of grammar at a perfect pace. I honestly don't see a way to improve this course since it's already so amazing! ",
            "\u00a0The class size was too big by four or five times. Professor Lee did a great job trying to keep everyone engaged and speaking but the sheer volume of students made that very difficult. The other big weakness was the textbook, which was pretty useless. It did not have comprehensive vocab lists with accompanying English translations, nor did it clearly list the requisite grammar to understand the content. On a related note, we were not quizzed on all the vocab we had to know, and with the volume of extra material we learned in class (extra in that it wasn't in the book) it was not always clear exactly what vocab we might be tested on.\r\n\r\nThat said, tests were fair and did not usually have more than a few unexpected vocab words. Worksheets and handouts from Professor Lee were better than the textbook and I will be saving them forever. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Lee-Smith is either the best professor I've ever had at Yale or tied for the best. My only regret about this class is that I wish I had taken it earlier so I could have taken more classes with her before graduating! This class was so well planned and structure, so thoughtfully developed and so well taught. I've taken three languages at Yale and this has been by far my best experience. Absolutely outstanding. ",
            "\u00a0Making clear what vocab is necessary to know for tests and exams. Also making sure that those who came into the class with no prior experience didn't feel like they were behind. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Lee-Smith is amazing! She's really kind and good at explaining the grammar concepts in Korean. I also like that there were occasional cooking & food events with the advanced classes that even L1 students were invited to. ",
            "\u00a0I really, really liked this class. Even though its L1, I feel like I gained a solid foundation and am able to recognize what we learned in class while listening to KPOP or watching Kdramas. The only thing I would suggest is to space the homework out more evenly; some days there would be nothing and other days there would be a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fun but also reasonably challenging-definitely a class I enjoyed taking. It was however very fast paced. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you a lot, and is flawlessly taught. Sometimes the pacing can seem wonky, but actually it is really good. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the workload is extremely light and manageable without feeling too slow or boring. It was quite fun since the class centered around speaking and we would often talk to each other to have a better grasp of the language! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very comfortable learning atmosphere\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes I cannot wake up in the morning ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lee-Smith is super kind and is super patient with you, even if you mess up or you're even not that good. She supports all her students and tries to get to know them personally. She engages with her students as much as possible, in and outside the classroom. She tries to find ever person's potential and talents and loves to brag about her students. She is a great professor and make the class very engaging. \r\n\r\nThe class itself is somewhat more relaxed than other classes and it is perfect for a language class. There is a lot of focus on speaking in class and grammar for homework, and it helps give us more exposure to listening and speaking. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that the class was taught in a manner which would benefit a smaller class. I'm not sure why, but this year there was a lot more students taking L1 Korean. I think Professor Lee-Smith was used to small classes and this large class was kind of a different classroom environment than what she was used to. "

            "\u00a0I truly would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn a new language. The professor is amazing and results pretty clear as you progressive through the course that you ARE learning. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend for someone who wants to start learning a new language. It's fun, well-taught, and the class has a great community feeling to it. The workload can be a lot at times but overall isn't bad at all. ",
            "\u00a0I always wanted to learn Korean, and if you want to as well I highly recommend it. This is a great environment to learn in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student (in fact, I've been suggesting it to so many people already!) The class is extremely informative and fun. It covers the basics of Korean grammar, vocabulary, and more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class, provided the department hires more professors to decrease section size. My section was 21-22 people, far too big. It was easier than L1 Chinese in most every way, especially in workload. ",
            "\u00a0I literally cannot recommend this class highly enough. Of the three languages I've taken at Yale, Korean was far and away the best. Prof Lee-Smith is an angel -- so kind and nurturing, so knowledgeable and thoughtful, so responsive and such a good instructor overall. She deserves every teaching award that there is. You'll learn a lot in this class while not being too stressed and feeling really supported and welcomed. Just an outstanding experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even if you don't plan on learning the language further (and just need to fulfill the language requirement) I highly recommend. The teaching is great, the class is engaging, and the language itself is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're looking to take a language while at Yale, take 110 w Prof Lee-Smith! Korean is a challenging language if you don't have a background in EA languages, but Prof Lee-Smith makes it fun and easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0If you're ever wondering what language to take, take L1 Korean with Professor Lee. Never in my life have I had a teacher who is so genuinely invested in their students. She's one of the purest people I've ever met, and her sheer faith and dedication to helping her students learn makes L1 Korean an amazing experience ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was great, especially if taught by Angela Lee-Smith. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in learning Korean! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this course to another student because the professor was great and made the class enjoyable to attend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a good choice if you are thinking of learning Korean or try to know more about Korean culture through its language. ",
            "\u00a0YESSSS!!! You need to experience Professor Angela Lee-Smith before you graduate from Yale! "
