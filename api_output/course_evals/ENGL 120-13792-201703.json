            "\u00a0I learned a crazy amount of writing techniques and essay writing skills, and it was incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily learning to write stylistically. ",
            "\u00a0i learned some of the core aspects of writing a good essay: captivating lede, defamiliarization, micro-essays, etc.  i learned the different lenses through which i can write a non-fiction essay (place, political argument, etc).  i learned the far-reaching realm of non-fiction and the blurring between fiction and non-fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Through a workshop-style class, I not only learned how to improve my own writing, but also gain insight into how to provide constructive criticism for my peers. I also developed an immense passion for reading non-fiction works by some of the best writers. I also learned how to be a flexible writer--exploring different styles of writing such as personal, humor, and journalistic. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my creative writing skills and developed a deeper understanding of essay structure. ",
            "\u00a0I became more exposed to creative non-fiction writing and techniques to write in that style. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved so much as a result of this course. We analyzed countless nonfiction essays for structure, word choice, tone, argument, and other aspects, and then we incorporated what we analyzed from other peoples work into our own writing process. I definitely learned so much about writing and pay a lot more attention to the details of my essays now. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skill I learned was how to structure an essay so that it is cohesive and transitions smoothly. "

            "\u00a0the reading list is fantastic and the pace of writing draft and revision is challenging but helpful for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is a wonderful course and every Yale student should definitely take it some time during their undergraduate career! You definitely develop a rhythm of writing, reading, and editing in this class and this consistent practice really does make you a much better writer and a more critical reader. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 in general is a good course. I wish we had received feedback more often and in more detail. It took a very long time for us to receive any feedback and when we did it was pretty minimal. This was frustrating as we were supposed to be improving off of each essay. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: My instructor's knowledge and teaching ability, the amount of reading we did/types of articles we read, assignment structure.\r\nWeaknesses: My instructor's feedback at times. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was strong because the essays covered a good spread of possible types of nonfiction, and 5 essays was the right number that gave us ample practice without putting too heavy of a workload. Overall, I thought the course was strong and I dont have any suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I think discussion would be richer if there were fewer texts to talk about each class, so that we could really mine each essay instead of skimming the surface and moving on to the next. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is a must for anyone remotely interested in writing. ",
            "\u00a0i would definitely recommend english 120.  the reading list is fantastic and it is very fun to be able to write creative and personal non-fiction.  the pace of writing a draft each week can be difficult, but helpful.  Dr. Hopper is a smart woman and a fantastic writer, but she was slow to give feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend English 120 to any student, because I feel that this course effectively teaches methods and rules of good writing which can be applied to many different writing forms. It's a great course to take if you want to practice your writing craft on subjects that you enjoy writing about, both so that you can express your thoughts on these things and so that you can enjoy the process of writing more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I definitely recommend English 120 if you're looking for an opportunity to read some of the greatest works of the modern day and are looking to improve your own writing! Don't be too caught up in the grading system because it can be kind of tough. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend students take English 120, but I would not recommend taking it with Dr. Hopper. She takes a very long time to give feedback and does not give very detailed feedback. English 120 is a great opportunity to improve essay writing by working closely with an expert. Dr. Hopper is an interesting person and a great writer, but she is not very focused on teaching English 120. Towards the end of the class she stopped reading our drafts. I like Dr. Hopper and think that she is very intelligent, but I don't think she was very dedicated to our class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think I developed as a writer but I struggled with the type of writing at times. I believe it is worthwhile to take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely take this course if you want to learn to write a persuasive nonfiction piece. I took both ENGL 120 and 114, and I think I got more out of 120, just because we did more actual writing in it. Also, learning to write a research paper is something that you can pick up in other, non-english classes. "
