            "\u00a0Got better at Spanish ",
            "\u00a0i gained a strong grasp of Spanish grammar, more confidence in my conversational skills, and a greater sense of Latin American culture and history throughout the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0spanish language skillz ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the culture of spanish-speaking countries as well as an intense knowledge of grammar and grammatical principles in spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about hispanic culture through primary source readings and learned how to closely read and understand more difficult writing in Spanish. I also developed my discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots of spanish grammatical tenses and modes and also some spanish culture! ",
            "\u00a0The course focused on the final verb tenses and grammatical structures needed to fully understand the language like compound tenses, idiomatic phrases, etc. In general, I think it improved my Spanish-speaking ability, if not for the sole reason that participation was required and the class met every morning. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable with speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish, and I learned a lot about Latin-American history. ",
            "\u00a0This course has helped me to improve my skills in speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish. We were told to speak Spanish every day and to use Spanish in all forms of communication in that class whether it be through learning and implementing grammar concepts or watching a movie that pertained to a topic of Spanish culture. It allowed me to learn not bout my own abilities when it comes to Spanish but to learn which areas I can improve in, and exactly what I need to practice to improve my competency. ",
            "\u00a0I developed much more fluency and written ability in Spanish, definitely a good class if you want to speak the language. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to read, write, speak and understand Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I developed more knowledge of vocabulary, Spanish-speaking countries, and solidified knowledge of verb conjugations. My speaking skills were worked and I gained more insight into thinking in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Really strengthened my Spanish grammar, writing, conversation, and my understanding of Latin American culture and history.  140 packs quite a bit into one semester, but I'm very glad I took the class. Katie's section was fantastic and felt very much like a family. "

            "\u00a0A lot of busy work, more than other Spanish classes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this class are that it meets everyday to maximize exposure to the language, and it's very well organized in order to be able to cover a lot of material in a short period of time while giving everyone a lot of practice. A weakness is that in class discussions are never very interesting and a lot of the work feels like it just takes up time. ",
            "\u00a0workload at beginning of semester is light, at end of semester is CRAZY heavy ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small class size, good teacher engagement, some fun assignments and movies\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not applicable -- I feel like I learned a lot about grammar. Almost too much. I would have rather learned less about specific grammar rules and spent more time just practicing my oral speech. ",
            "\u00a0The course has some open ended discussions towards the end, but many of them were a little too restrictive to feel like they were helping me improve my conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0It can be a little boring and repetetive, but the cultural content is quite interesting and you DO learn a lot of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Because this course meets daily and requires participation to earn a high grade, it develops students speaking ability in a way that higher level Spanish courses focusing on Spanish literature, etc might not. At the same time, some of the material, such as relative pronouns, didnt feel useful to everyday spoken Spanish; also, there were several reading passages that seemed neither relevant nor important to the topics we were learning. Overall, though, the course did a good job in reinforcing my knowledge of Spanish and speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0At times the class felt too much like a traditional Spanish class, as if we were just going through the motions, but otherwise I really liked the opportunity to work in groups and the opportunities to prepare speeches or debates on issues in class. ",
            "\u00a0one of the biggest strengths of this course is the fact that the class meets every day. It was so helpful to be able to practice my Spanish every day rather than simply every other or only twice a weeks since it is something that needs constant practice and while the daily homework seemed like alto it was necessary. One of the things that could be improved about the class would be the amount of homework that was assigned after the supersite had finished. ",
            "\u00a0Make the workload more even.  Sometimes the amount of supersite along with other assignments was far too much. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really comprehensive and I definitely improved in my Spanish. The grammar was super boring because we learned (what felt like) 20 tenses but it was necessary. The presentations and debates and gallery trips were great parts. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course did a good job of teaching the material, but could be more engaging in class activities. Overall, there were not many weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Its a lot of work ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for someone who was interested in learning Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, given that the student is willing to put in effort for the class. A lot of the grammar rules are detailed and specific, and do not come intuitively to everyone. Also, many of the students in the class are upperclassmen given the level of the course, and accustomed to the teaching style of the spanish program at Yale, so if this is something you are eager to be a part of, I would recommend this course. If not, I recommend a lower level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I liked it more than L3 and felt like I really got to solidify my grammar skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if the student wanted to improve their spanish, but not necessarily for intellectual stimulation or excitement. ",
            "\u00a0If youre looking for a class that will improve your Spanish-speaking ability and build on your knowledge of the language, this is it. Id recommend the course to anyone taking it for that reason. ",
            "\u00a0Katie Brown is a wonderful teacher and an even greater person - if you need to, or simply want to, take L4 Spanish... take it with Profe Brown!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The workload is manageable, and it is clear that there is an effort being made to turn us into comfortable, Spanish speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. I personally feel as though y language abilities greatly improved and I also think that Katie notably was very helpful and wanted her students to do well but made herself availible to help when needed. I think that the way that the course was structured and the way that the syllabus was followed was very clear and it was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if the student was interested in Spanish, but I would warn them that the workload comes in waves and there are some nights where it is far too much. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the teacher (Katie), not the course, because it's required anyway. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was an effective learning experience and presented adequate levels of challenge for efficient learning. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend 140 to anyone who is interested in solidifying their Spanish skills.  Katie's section is fantastic, definitely take it with her if you get the chance! "
