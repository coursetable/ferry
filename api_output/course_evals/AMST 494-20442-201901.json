            "\u00a0The Senior Seminar for the Intensive Major was CRUCIAL in my success this year. I learned how to write succinctly, research intelligently, and write more coherently. I also walked away with an understanding of how to stick to deadlines and make a do-able timeline for big projects. ",
            "\u00a0In this second half of the AMST intensive senior project course, we focused on writing. I learned how to organize a large research paper and follow academic conventions. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me what it means to do independent research from beginning to end, from picking a topic, finding sources, going to the archives, crafting an argument, and writing a cohesive (90 page!!) paper. LiLi truly guided us through every step of this process, and Im so grateful for this thesis course. ",
            "\u00a0Agh! SO much. The main thing I learned though was how to envision my time over the course of a pretty large period and plan how to produce something not only longer than I was used to, but also hopefully more significant. ",
            "\u00a0The guidance I received over the course of the yearlong project was invaluable. Advisors aren't available in the ways you sometimes need them to be, and having a seminar leader saved my butt time and time again. It was also wonderful to share the experience with peers, and learn about their projects while working on my own. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The frequent deadlines and check-ins were extremely useful throughout the process to make sure we were all hitting our goals and progress, as opposed to scrambling at the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were undoubtedly related to LiLi, our instructor, but I am sure would be the same in upcoming years. Time management is huge for me - and this class seamlessly built it in to what would have been a very challenging semester. Other strengths were learning from others' projects. This is the capstone AMST class that we all needed. Weaknesses were that I wish we were asked to make a comprehensive outline BEFORE we started writing. This is just a personal preference but I think would have gone a long way for me. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the internal deadlines set for writing. Revision tips were also very helpful. LiLi is an excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had more concrete deadlines / checkpoints first semester, although perhaps that it is inevitable that the thesis will come together second semester. ",
            "\u00a0LILI was the most incredible advisor/coach/therapist/resource I could have ever asked for. She's so special. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the assignments felt somewhat like busywork. Also, the creative project/academic project divide feels significant enough to warrant two separate seminars. The conversations we had in class very often only pertained to the academic projects. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're an AMST major passionate about a particular topic or have a desire to put up a creative senior project, you absolutely should. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course provided the organization, encouragement, and structure I needed to successfully write a 60+ page Senior Thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because I would recommend doing the yearlong senior project. It allows for great depth in research, and the class is a great guide. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! So rewarding to engage in original research and produce a real thing! ",
            "\u00a0Funny question. There were times when the answer would most certainly have been ABSOLUTELY not. Senior year is short and special, and sometimes I felt frustrated that I was spending so much of it alone, working on this project. That said, having now finished it, I can say with 0 doubt that producing this work was the most important achievement I accomplished at Yale. I'm so proud of it. Based on that, I'd say if you have an idea that means something to you, go for it! ",
            "\u00a0Full year theses are awesome!!!! "
