            "\u00a0I learned to evaluate artwork from multiple points of view and especially to see how different traditions and cultural forces influenced a work, as well as how much artwork can tell us about the culture(s) it is a part of. I had good practice in evaluating works of art in a visual and historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new understanding of the art of the Americas in the early colonial period. I improved my ability to analyze objects and relate them to history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Aztec and Inca history outside of the colonial viewpoint. The course thoroughly helped me understand Aztec and Inca traditions in a respectful way that honored the history of the people without having it be tainted by the conqueror. It also did a great job of using outside sources and exposing students to the many resources in the field that Yale has to offer as we used many artifacts in the YUAG to analyze. "

        [
            "\u00a0Lectures were extremely engaging, and provided opportunities for students to speak about everything from their own analyses to the readings and even personal experiences. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job in using actual first-hand sources to strengthen readings and learning. "

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class. The subject matter is super interesting, and I like how we looked at the art more from the indigenous culture's perspective and actively questioned the European/colonizer's point of view. The workload is pretty chill, just 3 short papers a midterm and a final. The professor is really engaged in the material, she knows a lot and both she and the TA were really engaged in making sure we were successful. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any student at Yale, regardless of their academic background. I think that this class could provide challenge and engagement for any type of student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The art history class is wonderful for anyone interested in art history that does not focus on Europe. It is a great class to take to better understand the traditions and culture of the civilizations in Latin America in a scope that thoroughly analyzes their customs and explains them as well. "
