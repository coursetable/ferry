            "\u00a0This class makes you think a lot and makes you come up with real examples in order to make the abstract concepts of philosophy more understandable. ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken any sort of philosophy course before, so the most valuable thing I learned was how to write a philosophy paper as opposed to other types of papers. I had also never explored the concept of transformative experience before, so I learned all about that. ",
            "\u00a0Very rudimentary knowledge of philosophy, but the course focused a lot on the aspect of transformative experience including epistemic transformative experiences, preferences and endogeneity. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge and insight into a relatively new and interesting field of philosophy. The most useful skill I learned was definitely the ability to write clearly and concisely, to convey more with less. ",
            "\u00a0The concepts of transformative experience, decision-making, and philosophical writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a philosophy paper and how to learn in a collaborative way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the fundamentals about this contemporary philosophical theory and the ways to go about analyzing personal experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about transformative experience and basic metaphysics ",
            "\u00a0This class made me think a lot about who I am in relation to the events that have occurred in my life. There is an undeniable power to the experiences we go through and the subsequent transformations we undergo. Professor Paul's class forced me to evaluate how transformative experiences shape us, and how rationality and mental corruption play into this fascinating subset of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a good knowledge about basic philosophy and in particular a really in-depth knowledge of the field of transformative experience which has led me to look differently at certain situations and I have even began to consider it when making decisions for myself. ",
            "\u00a0The anatomy and various types of a transformative experience, as well as how to use examples in philosophy writing. ",
            "\u00a0Because I had never taken a philosophy class before, I was introduced to many new ways of thinking. I learned how to write a philosophy paper (there was quite the learning curve), and I began to analyze the articles/works prof. Paul had us read in a much more beneficial way. I also learned the skills needed to interact with others when part of a small group. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much terminology on what a transformative experience is and how to evaluate whether an event is a transformation or not. I learned how to construct a philosophy paper as well. ",
            "\u00a0I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I believe that this class provided a nice introduction to philosophical thought and debate. While the class focused on Transformative Experiences, Professor Paul also led the class in discussion of how this topic pertains to other areas of philosophy. I learned a new way of decision-making, and am quite pleased with how applicable the course is in daily life. I have also learned how to write philosophical papers and greatly improved the quality of my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, Transformative Experience stimulated growth not only in the way that I approach philosophy, but also in the opinions I have about the philosophical issues we covered. \r\n\r\nBefore I took this course, I had no idea how to write for philosophy. Because of Professor Paul's (extremely helpful) writing sessions, I ended the course understanding the structure of philosophical writing. Not only has this given me greater confidence to take philosophy courses in the future, it has also had a lasting impact on my understanding of how to think clearly and order my thoughts in an understandable way. \r\n\r\nHowever, Transformative Experience did not only strengthen my ability to write. I also found myself increasingly able to think precisely about philosophical issues on the fly. Whether in class discussions or in the context of the various symposia that we attended, I found myself having an increasing number of moments of clarity that helped me formulate better questions and grapple more effectively with the subject of the discussion. \r\n\r\nEven if Transformative Experience had given me none of these skills, it still would have been a worthwhile course for me to take because of the subject matter. Considering the philosophy of Transformative Experience--and the implications it has on cognitive science, decision theory, etc.--has given me a new understanding of how to assess the framework that I use to make decisions. As a college first-year, I've found this subject to be highly relevant, which has both deepened my experience of the course and also necessitated the immediate absorption of my in-class knowledge. "

            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it is very experienced based, so almost everyone can relate to the topics in discussion without having much background knowledge on the specific areas. A weakness of this class is that it moves very slow sometimes, for example professor LaPaul would spend two weeks, which is 4 classes on the same topic and using the same examples. ",
            "\u00a0This course sometimes felt pretty narrow for a full course. It felt like we were sort of talking about the same thing all semester. It was cool that Prof. Paul brought in work from other fields such as psychology and cogsci, but the scope still felt restrictive sometimes. Also, at least before the midterm, the class was basically derailed every meeting by questions that were only somewhat relevant. The structure got a lot better after the midterm, so continuing a less question-based structure would be great. ",
            "\u00a0More structure and less lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Paul was always great about answering student questions and trying to make sure each student understood the material.  Sometimes, however, this cut a little bit too much into class time and led to some class periods being derailed by repeated questions that could have better been addressed in one-on-one discussions. Especially near the end of the semester, this led to some material being rushed through. Professor Paul was aware of this however and this material was not very heavily focused on in our final paper, unless we wanted it to be. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really good class, with a good professor and very supportive TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course in the classroom; amount of reading per week was overwhelming at times ",
            "\u00a0This was an intriguing topic, but I felt that it was difficult to really go further and more in depth with this topic without it being repetitive. Albeit, I learned a lot but there were definitely moments where I felt we had already talked about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of this class' strengths is its relaxed nature. I never felt overly stressed or lost, seeing as the class was structured like a casual conversation that encouraged us, the students, to be inquisitive and ask questions. On the downside, I felt like some of our lectures/lessons were not spaced out well enough. There is a surprising amount of stuff that can be covered in regards to the philosophy of transformative experiences. However, we ended up spending a very large amount of time on the first part of the class (which was mainly centered on what a transformative experience is) and not as much time on other equally fascinating things (e.g. religion and mental corruption). Therefore, some of our lessons were highly repetitive while others seemed to be covered only briefly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Eventually led to a good understanding of the field which can be applied to a number of different aspects of life. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The first month was relatively repetitive and it felt as if we were not really doing anything new, this left us with less time to spend on the more interesting and relevant concepts studied in the latter part of the course. \r\nThere is a lot of readings which are interesting but not all completely necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - teacher cared very much about her students, learned quickly. She made sure all of us were comfortable with the content/unit before moving on. I loved that she offered a New York trip and really valued the bond among the students of the class, facilitated by Professor Paul.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The content did not feel that meaningful, we spent too much time on epistemology at the beginning. The first half of the course felt highly repetitive. Too much attention was given to the minority of students who participated enough in class, and too little to the quieter students.\r\nIt often felt like the professor was egotistical about her work, assigning a lot of her own writing or writing that referenced her. I understand that she is one of the first in her specific fields, but perhaps she could use more work by others. This improved as the course continued. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course was that the professor knew everything about the topic and had the capability to explain any question asked. I think a weakness would be that the class may not have been structured enough, so there's a chance a few too many questions were asked. More material could have been fit in. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\nThe structure of class was a loos structure, which i enjoyed\r\nTeacher was super engaged and passionate\r\nWas interesting\r\nCons:\r\nWouldnt always understand everything we talked about, but thats philosophy ",
            "\u00a0One major strength of the class was the paper review sessions held before each paper was due. I believe these sessions provided the helpful criticism that improved the quality of my philosophical writings. In addition, many of the assigned articles were quite interesting and complemented Professor Paul's teaching in class. However, one weakness lies in the fact that we did not review all articles that we were assigned. Furthermore, while I enjoyed the lively discussions we held and the questions my classmates asked about the material Professor Paul was covering, I feel like these questions were asked to such an extent that we were sometimes unable to reach even the material were were to cover for that class period. The end result was that we missed certain ideas and concepts that we should have mastered to further our understanding and which we had to use to write our papers. One way I believe this might be avoided is to allow a limited number of question during discussion, or perhaps to have Professor Paul finish presenting information on one topic before answering questions.

            "\u00a0Yes! It is not a lot of work. It explores very interesting topics. The professor is cool and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in philosophy, take it. If you want something that examines a broad scope of philosophical questions, though, don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course probably wont be offered again for a while but it was amazing. It truly changed the way I think about my life and evaluate decisions. It would be interesting for anybody. If this is ever offered again, TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - no matter your area of study, this class is well worth your time. This is exactly the kind of class I was looking forward to taking at Yale - something unexpected that looked  interesting and exciting and turned out to be exactly that. ",

            "\u00a0I definitely would! Once the semester really kicked off and we began exploring different facets of this philosophy, the class became extremely interesting. It made me truly examine what it means to undergo a transformative experience and the impossible rationality of transformative decision-making in terms of my own life and the lives of those around me. ",
            "\u00a0I would if they were looking for a class with a lovely professor that was interesting without being too challenging. I would not recommend to someone who was looking for a serious philosophy class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, the teacher was my favorite this semester and she made it super fun to engage in her classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students due to the fact that this course offers instruction to a unique topic within philosophy that has only recently been delved into. It presents a unique perspective into philosophy and is quite applicable to everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. For all the reasons stated above, Transformative Experience was a transformative experience. "
