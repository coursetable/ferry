            "\u00a0I learned how to read for what was important in the text; I gained a greater understanding of the foundations of the western canon; I was given the opportunity to read these foundational texts so that I have a greater appreciation for where history/politics stands today ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the modern continuation of the western canon with respect to political philosophy. ",

            "\u00a0I liked that we got to read foundational texts within Historical and Political Thought. At times, though, the reading was very excessive--for example, there is no way that we could possibly talk about 200, even 100, pages of reading for one class. With DS, there is a very fine line between reading enough of a work to truly appreciate it and overwhelming the students with so much reading that there is no way they can be expected to read it all--and most do not read it all. Perhaps a solution would be overall shortened reading assignments or the same assignments with specific emphases on what sections will be focused on in class. \r\n\r\nI also like the fact that the class was arranged in a seminar fashion to facilitate discussion; I did not like the fact that it seemed that the same people were always dominating this discussion while certain people never got involved. ",
            "\u00a0Too surface level  although this is part of the nature of the beast that is DS. I wish we spent more time on some of the most seminal works. ",
            "\u00a0The class was great! I really enjoyed many of the texts we covered. As always, Directed Studies has a balancing act of covering lots of material, while also trying to really grapple in a meaningful way with the ideas encountered. Professor Renaud is a really good professor to have. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. I loved the way connections could be clearly found between works and how readily comparable they were. I had a lot of fun with all I read, and learned an immense amount. A whole lot of reading, but that's part of the experience. ",

            "\u00a0Yes---despite the large amounts of reading, there is still such a greater understanding and appreciation for what has been written and how this will influence what will be written. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It is vital to know what history's thinkers have said about the world's politics. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies is a lot of work and really isn't for everyone, but Professor Renaud is a great professor to have for section. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very important and good foundation in the key thinkers of historical and political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was one of my favorite of the DS tracks. A lot of the books read like philosophical works, starting at a given premise and working outward, which I really enjoyed. Some works I would have even read on my own time, especially as we got towards the recent writers with Nietzsche and Freud. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. DS is worthwhile, and spring term H&P is especially fun and meaningful to modern day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great class for those who are looking to conduct a broad survey of main historical and political ideas in the Western cannon. Compared to the first semester, there was also a lot more variety in the texts that were chosen. "
