            "\u00a0I have learned about counterpoint, chord progressions, basic functional chromatic chords, and basic 18th century classical forms of music. I have experience writing music in the classical style for keyboard and string quartet. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge in writing music and understanding music theory specific to the style of eighteenth century classical composers like Mozart and Beethoven (with some baroque examples like Bach). I was able to understand the underlying forms for theme and variations and for minuet and trios. I now know how to compose a theme and variations and a minuet and trio. Very good class to take if you want to compose in the classical (period) style. In this class, you are able to build what I call your \"musical toolbox,\" or a kit full of different musical aspects to put into your projects. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better construct musical phrases and compositions in the classical style. I gained knowledge on the fundamentals of functional harmony. I feel I can listen to and understand classical music better now, and am a better composer as well. I can also apply what I learned in class to understand the basis for some compositional techniques in modern music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about music theory and composition in the classical style. ",
            "\u00a0Learned bass clef, some more music theory, basic structures of phrases/minuets, COUNTER POINT! Learned how to use Sibelius and how to compose basic pieces (ie for piano or string quartet). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various compositional techniques and conventions. The course gave me insight on common practices used throughout different centuries of classical music. ",
            "\u00a0Harmonic analysis, score analysis, composition. ",
            "\u00a0Counterpoint, binary form, how to write a theme and variations and minuet and trio, different types of chords and sequencesa composition-based music theory course ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in counterpoint, how to recognize musical phrases and non-chord tones, and composition skills in pre-Classical-Classicak style. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a set of well-rounded basics for musical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned species counterpoint; various techniques of composing variations to a theme; how to balance a four-voice composition; characteristics of a minuet and trio; harmonic analysis ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various different types of music from the Classical Era and how to compose in those styles, including Theme & Variations and Minuet & Trio. I also developed a better understanding of chord progressions and voice leading as they pertain to composing, as well as some new types of chords, like Neapolitan and Augmented 6th chords. "

            "\u00a0This class is very interesting. At no point did I feel unengaged or bored. There were many opportunities to discuss and learn from peers' homework in class. However, sometimes the pace was a little slow. More material could be covered over the course of the semester easily without overloading students. Moreover, more homework could have been assigned for further practice of the concepts learned in class. Very friendly environment, and overall pretty good! ",
            "\u00a0A strength is how learning the material progresses: you start by learning counterpoint, and then move into actually looking at classical pieces to understand how composers made their music (while referring somewhat to counterpoint). Then you move into what I call developing your \"musical toolbox,\" where you learn different musical aspects that composers have used, such as proper ways of using non-chord tones. You write a midterm and final project, which are the theme and variations and a minuet and trio, respectively. These projects really put you to the test to see if you understand how to use your \"toolbox.\" One of the weaknesses is that there is no true way to understand the concepts without writing music: so you need to write as much music as you can (or write many drafts of your projects). ",
            "\u00a0I loved being able to apply what we had learned in our own compositions. This was a fun course, and the homework assignments never felt like a chore.\r\n\r\nI think that in/out of class assignments to practice concepts would be more effective than going through examples as a class, as class examples only require that a few students understand the material and are able to follow along.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the class structure could vary from being strictly lecture style, I think this would help with student engagement. For example, I liked when we composed counterpoint on the board with input from the class. ",
            "\u00a0At times, it went a bit too quickly, but overall, very well taught and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very fun and chill - almost too chill! Prof Adam was so great. Even though he sometimes forgot to post homework and was very lenient with assignments, he was a great lecturer, great at sight reading all our pieces, and gave good feedback. Definitely try to take a course with him! ",
            "\u00a0The course offered an environment for students genuinely interested in music theory to explore compositional techniques. Examining the works of classical composers and discussing their characteristics each class was fun and exciting.\r\n\r\nAdding more structure would improve this course. Many of the classes mid-semester felt like a loose, arbitrary discussion of musical conventions. Having an outline of the various topics discussed throughout the entire course and a synthesizing assignment/lecture at the end of each \"unit\" would tie the course together nicely. ",
            "\u00a0While class time was mostly helpful, we spent a lot of class time looking over pieces that got redundant after the third or fourth example. I wish we had more handouts and exercises to engage us during class time. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot with a low workload although I wish we spent fewer class periods just listening to sometimes arbitrary music and kind of talking about it \r\n\r\nNot gonna say I didnt enjoy immensely listening to Rzewski and Ravel though :) ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was well taught but could have had a little more structure to it. I would have liked a loose syllabus with a rough outline of what we cover and when we would cover it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths on the course include the professor. He was very willing to answer questions and was thorough in this response. He also showed examples on the board and was able to illustrate some examples on the piano. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there is a good balance of structure and creative freedom when it comes to the composition assignments. Additionally, there is not much homework, so it is a fairly low time commitment. Also, Professor Adam is a fun and kind teacher. The weaknesses are that sometimes the class moved at a slow pace, and there were not many assignments, so there was not a lot of opportunity for growth and improvement. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I think it is a great class to begin learning music theory; moreover I can assure other students that this class will not be dull or overly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student because this course is so much fun and I loved every minute of it. This class felt a lot shorter than the 75 minutes is actually was, and being able to compose music in the style of the classical period is an amazing experience. I did not have to take this course for my major, and this is why I think everybody should take this course! This course offers a creative outlet that is rarely attained in other classes, so this class will be nice break from the others (also, if you're a STEM major, then this class will be a VERY GOOD BREAK). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who likes music composition or theory. As someone with had this interest, I felt that the course was fun and that it made me a better composer and musician. Without this passion going in though, I think the course could be uninteresting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Particularly with Dr. Adam, the course was taught extremely well and you get to analyze pieces of music in class. ",
            "\u00a0For sure. You do need to know how to read music and basic music theory though. Placement test was a good indicator. I placed halfway from 110 to 210 but was perfectly fine in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Students genuinely interested in music theory will find parts of this course very interesting. The course offers students a look into the fundamentals of composition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I have a much better understanding of harmonic analysis and how to mimic different styles and techniques in my own compositions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in music theory and music from the pre-classical to classical era. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- provides a great music theory foundation essential to anyone interested in studying music. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. I learned a lot about classical composition. The class has improved my composition and analysis capabilities for future growth. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to any student who has a fairly strong foundation in music theory and wants a pretty easy class to start learning how to compose in the classical style (which can help for composing in any style). Do not take the class if you do not already have some music theory knowledge or if you want a class with a quick pace. "
