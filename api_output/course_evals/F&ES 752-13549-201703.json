            "\u00a0I think this is a very important and relevant class, keeping up with the high standards kept by Yale in general, and F&ES in particular. The topics covered and the readings were all excellent. The instructor was really good. Earlier, my ideas of tropical forest ecology was based on the previous classes I have taken on this topic. This class made me realize the serious drawbacks of the earlier classes, and also in my knowledge. Its apt coverage of the topic and the depth helped with understanding various streams of thought in the matter and study the topic deeply at a graduate-student level. I developed a clearer understanding of the theoretical background regarding many tropical-forest phenomena, including biodiversity, community assembly, etc., which would have been far more difficult without this class. The class helped me a lot to organize my thoughts in line with my research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about plant and forest ecology, and about current research on forest conservation. ",
            "\u00a0good survey course on tropical forest ecology. ",
            "\u00a0So many new concepts on competition and interaction between species in tropical forests; in-depth looks into the human-forest interface ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about tropical ecology! My knowledge of tropical ecology was limited coming into the class and after taking the class I feel much more prepared to immerse myself deeper into the field of tropical ecology. ",
            "\u00a0I really got a lot out of the articles we read and the discussions in small groups. I also appreciated the focus on theory since it was a gap in my knowledge before taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strong foundation in tropical systems. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of basic concepts, and current scholarship around tropical ecology and forestry ",

            "\u00a0My knowledge of tropical forest ecosystems (threats, processes, species) has been greatly increased, as well as my desire to learn more and work in those ecosystems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of Ecology of tropical forests, and the complex web of interactions that are at play. Although some concepts were known to me, I was able to strengthen my scientific understanding  of some methods of sampling and the implications of some cutting-edge research for policy decisions "

            "\u00a0I would say I got more than I expected. I was expecting the course to be of a refresher class, to brush up my knowledge. Rather it opened up a whole new, critical set of knowledge regarding a more comprehensive perspective on tropical forest ecology than I had before. It helped me a lot with streamlining my thoughts, give me new insights, and gave with with much-needed conceptual clarity. Now I feel very confident to talk about the topic. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the ecology as basic, could have used some more hard skills and less writing. ",

I was slightly worried at the beginning of the class that the material would be too elementary for me but I was wrong to worry. Every class tackled a new important topic in tropical ecology in a way that was easy to understand and relevant to modern issues that need to be addressed in tropical ecology. ",

However, I was very happy to know that Liza was very open to the fact that students could choose their research topic out of a bunch of different topics, involving human-nature relations in tropical forest landscapes "

            "\u00a0Strength: applies to people are varying experience levels.  I don't have a super in depth ecology background, but the material was still accessible.\r\n\r\nGood energy in the room.  Active discussion and debate.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses off hand. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the themes selected and papers used to illustrate them.  I also really appreciated the short writing assignments for every reading--it helped keep me on task and made sure I got them done every week.  The study guide Liza gave us before the midterm was also excellent and very helpful--she clearly had a lesson plan laid out in terms of what we were expected to learn and she was great at communicated it to us. \r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to go a bit more in depth at times.  Some of the small group discussions didn't really do justice to the complexity treated in the papers we read ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very engaging by itself. I can't think of anything that would specifically have improved the class, besides maybe a little bit more feedback on weekly assignments for understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that the course has everything that is essential for an entry-level practitioner interested in working in the tropics. The way in which all activities are planned really helped me understand the problems, its implications and possible solutions "
