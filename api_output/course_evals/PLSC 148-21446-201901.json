            "\u00a0I learned about the international human rights framework, particularly with respect to the United Nations (e.g., Universal Declaration of Human Rights - UDHR).  We learned historical background before diving into a series of contemporary issues (e.g., women's rights, children's rights, refugee rights, disability rights, LGBTQ+ rights).  There was a heavy focus on writing, which involved critical thinking and analysis of topics covered in a particular unit of readings/lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course examined the international human rights project from several different perspectives: History, philosophy, case studies, thematic issues, and so on. It is a survey course, and so it studies a broad variety of issues and rights. The syllabus begins with the fundamental framework and genesis for midcentury ideas on universalist rights. The course then goes on to challenge and expand on those ideas, moving from broad philosophical frameworks to specific case-motivated and delineated rights. Students gain a good appreciation for the complexities of human rights, their challenges, and their manifold application in modern political discourse. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about human rights policies and their application to the modern world. I developed my critical thinking skills on current issues that are extremely complex and difficult to find answers to while working with topics that have no clear right or wrong answer. This class definitely opened my eyes to all of the ambiguities in the human rights system and the reasons for the number of controversies we have over human rights today, and it has helped me be more engaged with this part of our society. ",
            "\u00a0True to the course description, I learned about the theory and politics behind and surrounding human rights as an academic field and a practical approach. More importantly though I was introduced to the human rights program at Yale and was able to figure out whether it is something I may be interested in pursuing. ",

            "\u00a0This course is certainly a good introduction to human rights frameworks and institutions. However, I really think the academic level of this course should be improved. None of the readings were particularly challenging and they were treated at the surface level during section. The lectures also did not make any attempt to move past the very basics. ",

            "\u00a0Very boring, survey course to the point of being offensive; glossed over very complex and interesting questions ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the class section division because it gave us a chance to think more deeply about the topics. On the other hand, as expected of an intro course, it covered a lot of topics without too much depth. However, it was good anyway. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: very good introduction to this topic\r\n\r\nWeakness: Wish there was more time to spend on specific topics like race or women and human rights ",
            "\u00a0Many of the parts of the class felt very disconnected. Readings did not relate to lecture often, and the papers did not relate to discussions. ",
            "\u00a0lecture = reading off slides. This is both a strength and a weakness. Strength - you don't have to turn up. Weakness - you're wasting your time. ",

            "\u00a0The course does a wonderful job of providing students with a theoretical and historical overview of the human rights movement, as well as highlighting in more detail key contemporary issues.  It provides students with a framework of knowledge to analyze all sorts of world issues, regardless of ones major/background.  Students are able to dive into topics of greater interest through response papers and a final paper. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a fantastic survey of different topics. As a necessary corollary of this, does not go into depth on particular points that many students might find interesting. Striking a balance between covering a wide variety of topics, and studying the topics that are covered, at a suitable level, is a difficult one. Really, you could have multiple courses on human rights at this level. The assessment and writing structure is ideal, and the lectures are engaging. Guest practitioner lectures were illuminating. The readings are wonderfully selected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: cool guest speakers. Weaknesses: this must be a really hard class for a lecture, but the level of the class was way too low. No one showed up, no one did the readings, and section discussions were silent.\r\n\r\nCould be improved by giving us a grounding framework in human rights, that was largely absent. ",

            "\u00a0This class is an introductory level of studying human rights and the various field within, so it's not too in-depth. Yet, it is still really interesting of thought provoking--the lectures and section are genuinely interesting. ",

            "\u00a0The course felt monotonous at times, with little engagement at times between faculty and students. ",
            "\u00a0The topic itself of the course is highly interesting. The professors did a great job of explaining the set up of different generations of rights and of how the UN works. However, as it was only an overview course, it was difficult to fully grasp all of the complexities of all the different topics. "

            "\u00a0Not really. There are many courses at Yale in which you will learn much more, perhaps even about human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I think it briefly covered a lot of material in a short amount of time. For those who know little about human rights to begin with, this could be a nice way to immerse yourself in the subject matter. ",

            "\u00a0Apparently things have changed -- still a decent class with interesting enough readings and lectures, but it was unclear how in depth the response papers (with prompts -- which I found unusual to be given for response papers) were supposed to be. I ultimately felt like I did a lot of writing for this class -- more than I've done for actual WR credits. ",

            "\u00a0This is definitely a course I would highly recommend someone at Yale to take.  As someone without any background in political science, I found this course to be very engaging, and it challenged me to think about issues I hadn't deeply considered before.  If you do have a background in political science, you will obviously get something different out of this course, but it has something for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in international affairs, public policy, human rights, social justice, or advocacy. The human rights framework is one that is fundamentally important to modern activism and governance around the world. It is one many political science and history minded individuals would do well to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you have to ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I this was a great social science credit that was interesting but not too complicated. ",
            "\u00a0This class can be very frustrating  it doesn't really scratch the surface of any topic, but demanded work that seemed to be work for works sake (the response papers, of which there are four). Lecture was not particularly engaging or cohesive, and the material wasn't really tested or incentivized. This is a gut class; if you need an easy class that won't affect you all that much if you need to miss a lecture or skip a reading, this is it. But it can be profoundly frustrating if you do actually care about the material. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0It is interesting but kind of boring. The assignments make you think but are manageable. I would recommend it if your are interested in human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! The workload was very manageable, and the work was meaningful. I always learned something from the readings and was able to fit what interested me into my papers. ",
            "\u00a0This class is actually really interesting and engaging--no matter the interest level in the actual field of human rights--the lectures and sections are relevant and thought-provoking. ",

            "\u00a0Unless the student has a strong passion for learning more about human rights, then I would advise to stay away from this course. Many consider it a gut course, however as a person interested in the social sciences, this course was fairly dry in comparison to others. ",
