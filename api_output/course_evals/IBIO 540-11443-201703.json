            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount of very applied information about a selection of important autoimmune disorders, including their associated phenotypes, animal models, molecular mechanisms, and current standard of care. I learned to view problems in the field of immunobiology for a translational perspective, in which the ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes. ",

            "\u00a0Really good speakers; however, it was difficult to determine which information would be important from the lecture in order to answer the homework questions. The powerpoints were also not always available, making the homework difficult. Perhaps a broader-based, pre-lecture assignment that helps to channel the focus of students, especially because there are students from a variety of backgrounds in the class, would be beneficial for understanding, as well as to facilitate more meaningful discussion with the guest lecturer. Alternatively, if the class met two times per week - once earlier in the week for an overview of the presentation topic and its important, associated immunological principles by Dr. O'Connor (or this could be optional for students who  do not have a strong immunology background, or students simply interested in knowing more) this could be extremely helpful as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Lectures from leaders in each disease provided a highly relevant and up-to-date perspective on what is known in the field. \r\n- Small class size provided space for student engagement.\r\n- Only having one lecture per week allowed me to tag this on as a sixth class.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n- At times, having a different lecturer every period led to a lack of cohesiveness throughout the course; this format lacked central themes, to an extent, though these were emphasized throughout the homework, which served as a source of consistency. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Very interactive class\r\n2. Timely feedback on assignments\r\n3. Humor instructors\r\n4. Latest & most advanced look into translational medicine\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Could add sessions that discuss about problem sets\r\n2. Could do a wrap-up that summarizes different diseases and most advanced/effective treatment ",
            "\u00a0The course was very diverse in its reach which was good. I wish The lectures were recorded and that we were assured the slides and notes. I also Wish the homework were more closely related to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the class project of writing a translational immunology grant. It was a great way to learn in depth about a specific area of translational immunology and was a good way to learn general grant writing skills. \r\n\r\nI wish the course went more in depth into the immunology.
