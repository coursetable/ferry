I really was able to develop my Italian skills and feel that I really benefited from the third semester of Italian. I am looking forward to taking another semester. ",

I also wish that we talked more in class and had actual discussions as opposed to just all answering the question of the day. It felt like a waste of time to go through the grammar each day in class, because it isn't anything that we can't learn on our own. ",
