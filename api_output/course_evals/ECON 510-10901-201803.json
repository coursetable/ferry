            "\u00a0The course could connect to the real world more by talking about when the models work well and when they don't, and what one can accomplish with them (for example, when they have been successfully used for predictions or policy recommendations). For someone who will not work in macro theory, knowing the technical details of a bunch of models is not so useful, since I will probably never use them outside these courses. It would be much more helpful to focus on how to construct models, how to tell if/when they are good, and how to use them. ",

            "\u00a0So I'm going to break my anonymity here by saying I took this class an undergrad who intends to go on to econ grad school. So my recommendation will only apply to someone in my shoes.\r\n\r\nI know in the PhD info sessions they advise against taking grad classes. From the perspective of getting into grad schools, this might be good advice. I did below average and wouldn't be surprised if that ends up dinging me. If you're looking for a less \"risky\" econ grad class, I'd recommend looking to the electives. This term I also took a second year grad class and  (I think) did above average. My hypothesis for why it is easier to do better in the second year classes is either 1) grades matter less for older students or 2) they simply have much more on their plates. \r\n\r\nBut let's say you're someone who doesn't care much about grades, who loves macro, and who seriously wants to attend an econ phd program. I would highly recommend this class. This class is not just like Macro Theory extended -- I've learned more macro than all my prior undergrad classes combined! It's a super cool feeling to be reading an Econ paper from the 80s, wonder why they didn't use a model you've learned about in class, and then realize that it's because the model was invented in the 90s. The professors are amazing and the PhD students are as well! \r\n\r\nYou should be very comfortable with Analysis (bare minimum Math 230/231 or Math 300). Bare minimum in terms of Econ background, I'd say, is Macro Theory (or maybe Intermediate Macro and some more theoretical elective). You should probably be a Junior and I would also recommend trying to coerce a friend into taking the class with you (the psets are long and it's much more fun to work with someone). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I find the topics discussed in the first quarter to be good preparation, and the topics in the second quarter to be very intrinsically interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is an interesting course, especially for people who like growth theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The strengths I mentioned above (in Question 3 of this evaluation) by far outweigh the weakness that I also mentioned. It is appealing to do a course that develop tools and skills - and hence allows the student to perform a wide variety of qualitative new tasks. "
