Lessons and studio classes promote a lot of growth. I have learned so much musically, and I get so much life advice from my professor. I don't think there are any weaknesses to this course. ",

Only at Yale could I major in a non-music discipline but still get enough music performance education to gain admission to graduate conservatory as a senior. I'm deeply grateful that this course exists. ",

Lessons really enrich your life, and you gain a sense of community and advice. Also, there is a sense of independence because you have a say in what repertoire you will be learning during the year.
