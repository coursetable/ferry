            "\u00a0So so much. This class fundamentally changed the way I interact with and think about the world. Hard to even begin describing it. Gives a powerful framework for thinking about category across time and space. Introducing new political modes of thinking about identity and solidarity. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is critical. Professor Grewal and Professor Carby are totally brilliant, but more than that, they actually act on the ideas and theory they read and develop. Really inspiring people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; if you are interested in thinking critically about race or caste and especially both, this is the best thing you can do for yourself. "
