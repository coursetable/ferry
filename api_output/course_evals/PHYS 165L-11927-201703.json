This course isn't about bogging you down with incredibly long lab reports, confusing course packets or intricate scientific methods. Instead, it teaches you to be more of an independent researcher. The course packet doesn't really give detailed step-by-step instructions, and a lot of times the student can choose how to proceed in the lab.

This sounds harsh and it's not directed towards the instructors -- they're doing the best they can considering they're teaching a pointless class. The emphasis on uncertainties, though, I have to say is unbelievably stupid. Show them once or twice, a few times. Test it once on a quiz or on the midterm, etc to ensure students understand it, fine. But to waste our time, week after week, calculating uncertainties when there are uncertainty calculators, is one of the most idiotic exercises imaginable. ",

            "\u00a0The midterm exam seemed quite pointless. I also think that having 10 point multiple choice questions on a 100 point exam was rather excessive. I would prefer to have more multiple choice questions, but have them each be worth something like 2-5 points. ",

Lab reports are just one page, the quizzes are short and reasonable, the lab packets and experiments aren't too long, and they are generally pretty transparent about the grading. If you're coming out of gen chem lab this will feel like a breeze.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading is a little strange. The course average is very high; basically everyone gets a perfect or near-perfect on the lab repots and quizzes. The final is then made unnecessarily hard in order to introduce a grading curve. I think this is an awful way to assign final grades and is definitely the weakness of the course. ",

It's nice that we only have to write one page but most of the time it felt a bit pointless. I understand that the instructors want students to reflect on each experiment but I'm pretty sure most students just write a couple paragraphs about sources of error that are already discussed in the course packet. Understanding error is important but I think asking students to respond to a couple of specific questions about each experiment would create more engagement with the class. ",

This was often due to uncertainty calculations. If we could have spent a bit of time clarifying the rules of uncertainty, and not doing as much with it as we sometimes did, it would improve the experiments. ",

TAs do not make you waste time/be superfluous. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exams are a very poor way to test how well you are doing in lab. The high pressure/timed environment is in no way representative of how lab work will be in reality. Some experiments are tedious and repeat sections unnecessarily. ",

Week after week, students kept getting points off for \"insight\" with the only recommendation being \"add insight.\" The \"insight\" that was ultimately accepted was not an understanding of the concepts, but a very brief statement just mentioning some random application loosely related to the concept.

            "\u00a0Strengths: No long lab reports (only a weekly page-long summary of the experiment), shorter than other science labs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I didn't understand the mathematical concepts behind the experiments; this became a problem on the final practical, so make sure you understand the math even if you think it's obscure! This was not emphasized enough in lab itself ",
            "\u00a0Nothing in this class was explained, and there are so many assumptions made about how much and how comfortable students are with physics. its not fair that the lab is introducing new concepts before the lectures are, and then students are penalized for not understanding something totally new from a 10 page hand out. There should be more collaboration between TAs and students, way more demos, maybe some quick review before each lab begins on main concepts and tips for uncertainty. for practicals, the topics really should be released beforehand so students can prepare conceptually. also multiple choice questions should not be worth 10 points with no partial credit given. losing a letter grade on a midterm or final becuase of one question is really unfair and honestly just doesn't make sense. ",
            "\u00a0The experiments can be super boring and cover material only covered by PHYS 180 vs. PHYS 170. Overall though, taught me how to do physics experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest weakness with this course is the amount of pressure put on the final due to the fact  that everyone does so well on all the labs leading up to it. I would have rather had slightly harder labs and then a easier final (or just a shorter final) ",

            "\u00a0This course was all right. I think it could be improved with more applications of the concepts we were learning to real life or more challenging labs -- as it is, we kind of go into a lab knowing exactly what to expect from the results, easily achieving those results, writing down what we've observed and gaining no new insights, which can be kind of tiring. That said, the general structure of the course is really well thought-out and the instructors and TAs are really great, passionate and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a very low workload and only meets once a week, but it is a three hours. At times the experiments were confusing and hard to follow, but in the end I really did come out feeling like i learned something. Many peers were upset with the length and randomness of this course, but I feel it is conducted in a manner that teaches a lot about uncertainty and gaining physical techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Only 3 hours long with a one page lab summary due every week.\r\nWeakness: The final exam was so hard. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly can't think of any strengths to this course. It was that awful. The quizzes caused a great deal of anxiety, even though I read through the handouts thoroughly before each lab, the grading was ridiculously harsh, and there was never sufficient overlap between what was taught in lecture to what was being experimented with. The final was incredibly difficult, and the concepts that we needed to know to be successful on it were never fully explained during the semester. Furthermore, I found it disheartening to have been asked by one of the professors what inertia was during one lab week and was given a discourteous look for not knowing the answer. We hadn't even covered inertia in Physics 170 and yet I was expected to give a correct answer. Ridiculous. In addition, for a 0.5 credit course, this course was a lot more work than the credit allotted, and I am very disappointed in the overall structure of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel here again that your experience in this lab really depends on the quality of your TA. Unfortunately, mine was not great and repeatedly was unable to answer questions about the labs we were performing. She also gave us incorrect information and was not open to discussing how I could improve on my lab reports. This meant my overall experience in the class was poor as the bulk of the teaching or guidance during labs was done by the TA. This is too bad because I've visited a couple of the other physics lab TA's sections and boy was it a night and day difference! They were helpful and kind and enthusiastic about teaching and the material. It's too bad I wasn't in their section, I would have learned more and also have appreciated the material more. ",
            "\u00a0The final exam was absolutely absurd. This is a physics lab that many students begrudgingly take due to requirements for their major or intended profession. The lab itself was boring beyond belief, but straightforward nonetheless and imparted the necessary skills and information. The final exam, however, was trying to trip students up and used skills and material that were never covered in lab nor the corresponding introductory physics classes. Ridiculous. ",
            "\u00a0The labs can be interesting, and the work is manageable. That being said, for someone who is not really interested in physics, the labs could feel long and dull at times, since they often consist of repetitive measurement and calculation. (However, I don't really think this is a reflection on the quality of the class, as this sort of measurement and calculation was important for the physics we were doing.) ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is pretty well designed, the workload is easy and the labs fit well to the progression of the physics classes they are supposed to accompany. This course doesn't teach you much in the way of new physics information (especially if you take it with 180 or 200) but observing physical phenomena helps reinforce the concepts learned in lectures. I liked the added midterm this year, it really helps you feel comfortable with the practical final. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course set up was good for a intro level course and the TFs were really caring. I'm not really sure how it could be improved. For what the course is, I really liked it. The final exam was very hard though. ",

The students in PHYS 180 learned about angular momentum and torque and all of that, while those of us in 170 didn't really have that content in our lectures. The lab is supposed to complement the topics learned in the lecture course but for me it felt like a completely different class. I had to learn completely new concepts in order to understand what was happening in lab. ",

            "\u00a0One or two labs could have probably been substituted for experiments that were more relevant to course material (although it must be hard to design a curriculum meant to work together with multiple different courses). There were many opportunities to do well, though, and the questions posed in experiment background material was thought-provoking and helpful in understanding the material. The short post-lab writeup is also a strength of the course, and I appreciated that there was a midterm because it helped a lot in knowing what to expect in the final exam. ",

",
            "\u00a0This lab course is manageable (you turn in weekly one-page lab summaries to go along with a full in-lab write-up, rather than a lab report) for most of the semester. The labs are tedious and can ask rather challenging/confusing questions, but you can rely on your TA to get you through. The midterm and final exam, however, are so much harder than the labs you're used to doing, which seemed really unfair to me. For those assessments, you're on a strict time limit (one hour per experiment, as opposed to the three you usually spend on a regular lab day), and the questions you're asked can seem rather unreasonable in terms of difficulty. Not every question is like this, but one of the three experiments we had to do for the final exam was definitely excessive (one of the questions involved differential equations, which I'd never seen and was really confused by). ",
            "\u00a0Grading seemed intensely subjective, and there were some students that felt almost targeted during grading- Despite not large changes in lab report content, there would be big disparities in grading. Overall, I really dont feel that I learned much about physics or scientific writing and that the material didnt match up with what I was learning in physics class, making this course a drag and probably the worst part of my week.

Perhaps a bit more standardization between TAs in what kinds of mini pre-lab lectures are given, as well as what is expected for addendums would be helpful. Still, labs are often a bit too long. The same concepts could be covered in a shorter amount of time without students becoming disillusioned by the length of lab. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the labs contain enough material to provide one with an in depth understanding of the principle, without being so long that students get distracted and restless. On weakness might be the variability in the TAs, however mine was excellent and make sure that each student understood the purpose and material of each lab. ",
            "\u00a0The lab manual was very clear and helped me get though the lab with minimal questions. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the switch to the one-page lab reports. I saw what was expected in previous years (handwritten, many page long lab reports), and I was so grateful that we were allowed to type ours up. \r\nOne weakness of this course was that it often felt like tedious, busy work. While I did think some of the lab days were interesting (gyroscope), other days (flipping a coin 100 times) felt really unnecessary, and I can't say I always came out of physics lab feeling like I learned something. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the lab instructions were often very detailed and explained things in a usually clear way although even then it was sometimes confusing and I couldn't see how it worked until I got to lab. Also strength: the 1-page lab write ups were good because other labs make you do pointless work that is very specifically formatted and there is seriously no need for a long pointless lab write up; a one-page summary does the job just fine. Weakness: this lab was just pointless. I really didn't learn anything and it was a waste of time. I only took it because it is a requirement for premed. Nobody was invested in it, everyone just wanted to get out of there. The experiments were tedious and dumb and usually demonstrated very very basic concepts so I didn't learn anything new. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, there are many weaknesses of this course. First, I believe that the experiments in question should be more closely related to the topics taught in the introductory physics courses. Second, I believe that there should have been greater information provided about the midterm and final, in terms of how to prepare, when they were to take place, the format, etc. Third, I believe that there must be a better way to have midterm and final exams. To me, it does not make sense to have a midterm exam, in which you have to complete one experiment in an hour, and a final exam, in which you complete three experiments in three hours (one hour each), because during normal lab hours, you have three hours to complete one experiment in lab. In this way, I feel that the exams are more a test of quickness rather than a test of greater understanding and attention to detail. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Labs are pretty well laid out and structured for learning.\r\nWeakness: Labs are very dependent on what your TA expects, so there is not much standardization across TA sections. ",
            "\u00a0Based on previous course feedback, I believe that the instructors have worked on aligning the experiments more with the physics lecture courses (170 and 180) though this is not always possible and I do not think this should be expected in any way. It is designed to stand alone or as a loose companion. Most experiments are fairly straightforward and do have practical use in teaching skills for the laboratory. Grading is generally fair with 60% of your final course grade based on the weekly 4-question pre-lab quizzes and lab reports. With that being said, the midterm and the final practical exam are sound in theory but highly unsavory in reality. They are based on several concept areas covered in the labs from the semester but have been manipulated so that new information is presented as would be expected. The flaw lies with the time constraint that is significantly less for each exam problem despite the intended shorter length of the experiment. Each question is also incredibly dependent on the previous questions, which is always a poor way to structure exams. All in all, the exams were not fair and representative of the duration of the course and felt contrived to fill in the remainder of the grade. I would recommend greater emphasis on improving the labs and less on an attempt to generate a larger standard deviation in grades. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is largely structured very well. I liked having a page limit for the lab reports although sometimes it was hard to get all of the information down in our lab notebooks during the lab period itself. ",
            "\u00a0It was a well-structured course. Love the style of lab reports and the set-up of the lab in general. However, would be nice if there was more communication between the lab and lecture course. Sometimes, there were concepts that we learned in lab before being introduced to it in lecture. Without having the conceptual background, it was difficult to understand what was happening in real-time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is well-organized and efficiently run, with clear expectations and feedback given with every lab report. Lab reports only take 1-2 hours, which is wonderful compared to other labs. It is nice to have a very transparent course.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Labs themselves can be tedious. Some feel like a waste of time (that penny flip experiment...). I have heard that TA quality/grading varies a lot (hopefully this is accounted for when doing final grades). The lab isn't very flexible in case you want to move lab days, which is frustrating since sometimes certain things come up. Final is SUPER STRESSFUL (extremely fast pacing). ",

            "\u00a0This course simply needs to cut down on the uncertainty calculations. We can all do basic math. Testing it week after week shows nothing (and certainly nothing about our physics knowledge). It's simply a way to waste our time and keep us there. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this was a really great little lab. Like with most TFs, mine took a little getting to know him, and if you wanted to keep all your points, you had to make sure to draw diagrams, write out procedures even if they were already there, and notate units. But really, it was quite chill and 3 hours is the perfect time slot. Maybe I would have liked a bit more in-depth view of some of the physical concepts, if I had to choose a weakness. ",

            "\u00a0Better than chemistry lab but still a lab. The midterm/final lab differs greatly from the pace and skills set by the ususal lab work. They seem much harder and I don't think it's the best way to test info. ",
            "\u00a0The course is easy to follow, systematically organized, and the expectations are clear. However, I found that the lab books were somewhat excessive in how much we had to write about our procedures. I also found that the focus on error calculations sometimes got repetitive, and yet I was still confused about how to mathematically solve for certain errors. This could be improved through a more intuitive explanation in lab about these errors. \r\nI also found it very helpful that we had a midterm to practice for our final exam. ",
            "\u00a0This lab was a very doable lab, with clear instructions in each lab handout that allowed for the directions to be easily followed. As a first-year who had never done any prior lab work, I believe that this is course was very well laid out to allow me to understand proper lab procedure and basic concepts such as uncertainties. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course are the instructors and my TF (Xinyi Chen) who try very hard to instill important laboratory techniques and knowledge of fundamental physics in students. A weakness of this course initially was the knit-pickiness of grading in my section, but this style of grading changed after the second lab report. ",
            "\u00a0I believe there are two major weaknesses in this course: 1) TA discrepancy and 2) lack of preparation/information about exams. TAs in this class varied quite a bit when it came to grading and while I don't know how this is accounted for, I hope it is. The Midterm and Final exams were certainly interesting and used clever ways of applying material but I believe we could have been given more information to prepare for this. ",
            "\u00a0A painless lab course for once. ",
            "\u00a0This course was ok. The biggest strength is the individual TA. I think the biggest weakness in this course are the exams. 1) They are not representative of what you do in the course. They are significantly harder than all the labs you do and you are given a time limit. Considering we did one lab a week in 3 hours, it does not really make sense that the final was 3 labs in one hour. 2) They treat the exams like it is a game, which does not seem respectful to students and again is not representative of the course. In order to ask a question during the exam, you must \"buy it\" aka minus ten points off. 3) Considering the exam/parts of the exam are out of a 100, it seems kind of strange that there were always two multiple choice questions EACH worth 10 points and correct answers on these were necessary for the rest of the lab. Overall, I am extremely disappointed in the way these exams were conducted. They were not fair and my grade suffered because of it. ",

That made some of the concepts more difficult to grasp. ",

As a result, I did not feel that we were at all adequately prepared for the midterm or final, which you must complete under almost impossible time constraints with no help. I hated the format of these exams, which make what could be an enjoyable lab extremely stressful for no good reason.

Having taken several other labs at Yale, I also appreciated that this course was truly a half-credit, and the staff made an effort to make the material interesting and challenging but not overwhelming or full of busy work. I really feel like I learned useful skills in this course, not just lessons in physics (though I did learn a good deal of those) but also general lab technique. The entire teaching staff was attentive and knowledgeable, and I felt like they really cared about my success and learning. Finally, I truly enjoyed the practical exams--they had the right balance of difficulty and whimsy! Even though I was not very excited about taking this class at the beginning of the semester, it ended up being my favorite course this term, and I think that change in mindset speaks to the high quality of the course material and staff.

Logger Pro can be a pain of a software to use. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the course seems fair enough. The post labs are concise and not superfluous. The reason why I don't recommend it is because the exams are completely unrepresentative of the rest of the class. In the rest of the class, if you put in the time and pay attention, you can get a good grade and do well. \r\n\r\nThe practical exams however are extremely stressful. Three experiments are stuffed into three hours into the final, and you are not allowed to ask questions. The pressure is so high, and it feels so unrepresentative of how lab work will be done in the future. No collaboration? Timed?

I often found myself having to apply concepts I did not understand to lab procedures that were not well written. At times, when I couldn't teach myself the material based off of the lab packets, I found myself just floundering through a three hour lab. Also, the grading feels somewhat arbitrary and it is very hard to get any feedback that isn't \"you didnt include insight\" (on that note, what even is insight? Truly feel like that was never explained). Not to mention, the practicals are really difficult and care more about your math ability than your ability to use the equipment in the lab. Even then, the math is really confusing and often felt inaccessible to me. I really tried in this class. I asked for extra help and did a ton of uncertainty practice on my own time, and I don't think any of it paid off.

It is designed to stand alone or as a loose companion. Most experiments are fairly straightforward and do have practical use in teaching skills for the laboratory. Grading is generally fair with 60% of your final course grade based on the weekly 4-question pre-lab quizzes and lab reports. With that being said, the midterm and the final practical exam are sound in theory but highly unsavory in reality. They are based on several concept areas covered in the labs from the semester but have been manipulated so that new information is presented as would be expected. The flaw lies with the time constraint that is significantly less for each exam problem despite the intended shorter length of the experiment. Each question is also incredibly dependent on the previous questions, which is always a poor way to structure exams. All in all, the exams were not fair and representative of the duration of the course and felt contrived to fill in the remainder of the grade. I would recommend greater emphasis on improving the labs and less on an attempt to generate a larger standard deviation in grades. ",
