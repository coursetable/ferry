            "\u00a0Learned to think about the weather and earth in a new way ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the atmosphere and oceans, but I learned more about how to cram a lot of unnecessary and minute information for the exams. The problem sets and exams don't require any advanced math skills, and you learn how to read climatology and oceanography maps. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the climate, atmosphere, ocean systems, and a little bit about climate change. Really practical and interesting stuff to learn, and useful too, if you ever plan to go outside and experience the weather. Decent amount of meteorology. Probably some of the most bang for your buck you can get as far as practical and readily applicable information learned in a science course. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained about atmospheres and oceans--the atmosphere and weather phenomena in particular--have lit up my experiences of my natural surroundings in a way I wouldn't necessarily have expected prior to taking the course. It's fun to be able to not just experience weather phenomena, but be able to identify them and to speculate about why they occur there and then. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a broad yet rather in-depth overview of the ocean-atmosphere system, and the physical laws that govern it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various environmental factors contributing to climate change. I learned what causes weather and seasonal patterns. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really good for people who want a strong foundation in climate science. The class is very demanding and gets through a ton of material, but I left with a way better understanding of earth science, especially atmosphere movements, global heat budget, oceanography, global wind and ocean current movement, and environmental change. The problem sets are a very cool way to study this stuff in a quantitative way, when normally this type of information is presented in a more quantitative way. The course does a good job of combining mathematical skills with conceptual understanding, and if you do all the work you will learn a ton throughout the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the physical processes that shape the natural world, the laws that govern them, how they affect weather, climate, and living things, and how all these things fit together. It was a very interesting and generally useful class "

            "\u00a0Strengths were that the material was interesting and weaknesses came from Prof Smith's engagement with students and with the lecture ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content of the course, organization\r\nweaknesses: format of exam problems, problem sets ",
            "\u00a0This was a poorly taught class. While the topics are somewhat interesting, it was a pretty boring class in which people dozed off or didn't even show up. The problem sets weren't bad, as you just had to refer to your notes if you followed his every word, but there was never enough time on the exams. There would also be questions on it about small details he mentioned once that weren't on the slides and you were expected to remember the significance of it. This was clearly an introductory course, with the amount of information thrown at us, but it could be improved by narrowing down the information within the topics that we learn about it so we can learn about those more thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0The topic is super interesting!! It just wasn't taught in a very engaging way unfortunately.... ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were good, I thought; Ron Smith really knows his stuff and explains it quite well, I think. I really enjoyed going to this course, and even to the required lab section.\r\n\r\nI feel like this course had a frustrating level of quantitative stuff for everyone. For people weak in physics and math, you'll have to work a lot to learn some of this stuff, and familiarity with at least the principles of buoyancy, pressure, gas laws, etc will make your life a lot easier in this course. Got to know your units--we did a lot of Joules, Watts, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are already good at math and physics, then it will feel really slow, and the exams will really frustrate you, because the qualitative questions depend on memorization of often minute and seemingly tangential material from the lectures, and the quantitative questions are too easy to generate much of a curve. So if you're into math and physics then the math and physics will be too easy, and if you aren't they'll be too hard.\r\n\r\nThe midterm exams were annoying in general. We discussed Hurricane Irma for a few minutes during each of the first couple lectures as a current event, but as this did not seem to be actually part of the curriculum, most people were shocked when it showed up as a question worth 12% of the first exam. And there were lots of other minutiae that came up on exams. Plus they were really rushed and I felt like I would have done better with a little more time and space to write. You were supposed to have a brief answer but then without the exact words they decided to look for you lost most of the points. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better to ask everyone to come in at 9:00 on midterm days, and then if that works for everyone, people will have more time to do the test. I've had other profs do that before.\r\n\r\nAlso I feel like the grading was very fast and sloppy for exams and psets; the TFs actually did one of the problems wrong for a pset before grading and therefore everyone got it graded wrong on their psets. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are clear and well focused, and the content of problem sets and exams strongly reflects those lectures. While review sessions were offered before tests, there could be more opportunities to seek help, especially between exams. ",
            "\u00a0I found this class to be most engaging in the way that it tied together many different ideas. I think that it could be improved with more care in a full understanding of the mathematical and physical concepts that governed much of the material. ",
            "\u00a0A very well-taught, organized lecture class. The exams felt very long. ",
            "\u00a0I think that some of the tests were a little too specific in terms what they were looking for in the answers and that some questions asked students to dig too deep into topics that were brushed over in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good survey course\r\nWeaknesses: exams difficult to study for because they focused on tiny details that were only briefly mentioned in lecture ",
            "\u00a0The course is tried and true because Prof Smith has been teaching it for so many years. It's one of those classes that pretty much every EVST and G&G major takes. It's so foundational, and provides a good overview of a ton of concepts, but also does not skip over the potential to go deeper into many of them. The problem sets are not very difficult, and offer a good motivation to stay current in the course. Lectures move very quickly but they're interesting, and Prof Smith does a good job of making it fairly clear what will be expected of students on problem sets and exams. The weaknesses of the course are perhaps that it goes through too much material in one semester, because the concepts fly by. We are encouraged to use the textbook to supplement our study, which I don't really like because the textbook provided way more detail than we were required to know for the course, which was confusing. And finally, the required lab is a bummer. It is not very engaging and it's a ton of work, and I didn't feel like it really supplemented what I was learning in the lecture course enough to justify the amount of work I put in on the lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be plainly taught better. The subject matter is really interesting, but things we need to know seem scattered. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Ron Smith is a great (if sometimes slow) lecturer, and can always come up with some example to illustrate whatever he is explaining or answer a question. He's had lots of experience teaching this course, so the lectures well organized. One weakness of the course is that sometimes the problem sets would require specific information from the textbook, which was rarely talked about in class (though Prof Smith seemed to be familiar with the contents of the book). The class could be improved if the textbook readings were maybe timed better with the lectures, and/or if the assigned readings were more specifically laid out. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but solely because the material is interesting. Professor Smith is a poor lecturer and problem sets and tests were graded harshly. ",
            "\u00a0No. Even within the EVST major there are other options and other lab options. Even Gen Chem was less tedious than the required lab that comes with this course. This class could be so interesting if it were taught differently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  This course gives you an overview of how the atmosphere, ocean, and to a lesser extent the Earth itself work with each other in a beautiful and intricate balance.  The lab is a bit of  a downer, though. ",
            "\u00a0I would, for the content. Interesting stuff to learn, and Prof. Smith is a good lecturer. I was just frustrated because I felt that my exam scores were not representing my performance in the course very well. Essentially they rewarded people who happened to memorize minute details from the lectures, and the quantitative parts of the exams were too easy, so if that's your strength you didn't really have a chance to excel in that area in terms of the curve. The final didn't have as much minutiae though.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, take it, but if you're already math and physics trained you'll be bored, and if you aren't at all you'll struggle with the math. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! I really liked the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is a great class for anyone majoring in earth sciences or environmental sciences, but also would be an engaging class for people interested in how the earth around them works. ",
            "\u00a0This class is well taught and often pretty interesting.  The tests often ask for some pretty random, unimportant stuff, like the type of satellites used for certain weather calculations.  You should take this class because you have to take this class.  Ron Smith seems like a really nice guy. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I had a lot of fun and I wish I had devoted more time to the class because it would have been even more rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this class! I thought the professor was awesome and very knowledgeable of all course material. He was very approachable and engaging. I thought the course was planned very well and al subject matter was important and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0only take this class if you have to or if you are genuinely interested in the subject material/willing to put in more work than the average class ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students who want to understand climate science and who are interested in studying earth science through a quantitative lens. If you work hard, attend lecture, study hard for the exams, and don't fall behind I think it's a gratifying experience. ",
            "\u00a0I guess so. The subject matter is interesting, but the execution is not great. However, for EVST majors this is one out of 3 choices for the science requirement and all of them are not the best to my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fulfilling course that every student should take at yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is curious about why Earth is the way it is. It makes you look with new interest and knowledge at things that you normally dismiss in your everyday life, like clouds, the weather, seasonal changes, geographic features, etc... I found myself thinking about things I learned in the class all through the following winter break. And Prof Ron Smith is a great professor and fun to listen to. Also, it's not too hard of a class, so that's nice. "
