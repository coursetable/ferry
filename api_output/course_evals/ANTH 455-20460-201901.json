            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I've ever taken! We read an ethnography every week, and class was basically a book club. Discussions were informative and structured by the questions written by whoever was leading that week's class. I learned a ton both about men and various types of masculinity around the world, and about how to analyze ethnographies and talk about anthropological theory. However, we rarely talked about masculinity without also discussing women, and so although the main subjects of our books were men, how these men interacted with the women in their lives was also a major theme. Marcia was a fabulous instructor, and had many interesting things to add to discussions. And she brought us snacks almost every week, which was much appreciated on dreary Monday afternoons! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different theories of masculinity, as well as ways in which masculinity interacts with mental and physical health. More broadly, I learned how to critically evaluate ethnographic research and write academic book reviews. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting insights into masculinity, and its relation to other important themes: addiction, urban poverty, race, sexuality, and power. It's a great intersection of gender and health issues, from a perspective that is less often taken up in WGSS. It's also a good place to gain access to a lot of important ethnographies on these topics. ",
            "\u00a0A strong understanding of masculinity theory, then applied to mens health issues across the world. Also anthropological methods were evaluated and how to write a book review. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about different gender studies/masculinity studies theories and then applied them to works concerning men's health all over the globe. Critical reading and speed-reading skills were definitely developed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply concepts in masculinity to a wide range of health issues from drug abuse to HIV prevention to infertility. Moreover, I expanded my conceptualization of how gender impacts health and came away with a much more nuanced view on the interactions of gender roles, sexuality, and health. Finally, I gained an appreciation for the potential of ethnography to reveal complex patterns in health. "

            "\u00a0This class was amazing and honestly doesn't need any improvement. The books were all interesting but were varied to give us a sense of many research and writing styles. They were structured well into larger topics. Workload is high but manageable, with 2 short book reviews, a longer final paper, and leading one class discussion (along with lots of reading). ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized, and I really appreciated that each person got to lead a discussion. I also loved reading all of the books! It's hard to come up with something that could improve the course, but perhaps it would have benefitted from a final class in which we summarized what we learned from all of the books and the ties between them. Because we read so much, it was difficult to synthesize everything and extract the big ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well organized. Professor Inhorn has one student every week lead the discussion, and we do a different book every week. Every week the leading student prepares a sheet of questions for discussion, so we always stay relatively on-track in our discussions and Marcia does an excellent job of moving the course along. The topics covered by the class are important and relevant, though relatively understudied by WGSS. The class environment felt very collegial and kind. I also think it's great that students do a book a week, because it allows you to get the full scope of the author's argument, even if you can't discuss it all in class. \r\n\r\nThe class might feel a little bit easy for those who have already put substantive amounts of thought into these areas, and despite her wonderful kindness Professor Inhorn can be very slightly patronizing at times. But overall, I found the class really eye-opening and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! Reading an ethnography every week was a good way to pace the class and I liked learning a lot about one topic as opposed to reading articles. Marcia did a great job guiding the discussion and the question set was a good guide. The lowest parts of the class were just when participation wasnt great, which is just a student balance problem of who is in the class. ",
            "\u00a0While the reading is quite a lot, it is all very engaging and interesting. The book-club style class was extremely enjoyable and it felt like I was learning for pleasure rather than out of obligation. It was overall a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the books (incredible reads, very insightful, and sparked good class discussion), the structure of class discussion (having a discussion leader create a question set for each book really kept these discussions moving and interesting by allowing us to get into more of the themes each week, rather than getting bogged down in a few details),  the feel of class discussions (complicated with some disagreement, but still a friendly, open environment), the structure of the syllabus (having key themes that grouped the books and the discussions and a theoretical preface was really helpful for building a collective understanding across the semester)\r\nWeakness: perhaps an assignment other than the book reviews might have been helpful for encouraging other types of engagement with class material "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class, if you like to read. The books were very interesting, and as long as you read them all the rest of the class is pretty straightforward. You'll learn how to analyze ethnographies and this class will teach you a lot about gender dynamics as well as public health issues. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar is no joke. The assignments themselves are not stressful, but the requirement and expectation to read a 200 page book in critical detail and be on top of your game for class each week is very, very demanding, especially if you are taking other challenging classes too. Skimming doesnt really work here. Discussions are wonderfully led and so fruitful so trust me in that you will not get the same thing out of just reading these books on your own. Would highly recommend and think it an important class and topic for anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's essentially a book club, so if you like reading, you'll have a blast! I found almost all of the books very engaging. Also, Marcia is a great instructor and encourages her students to challenge their previous notions of masculinity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is like a fun book club, and I would especially recommend it to male students (we only had one!). The topics covered, masculinity and men's health, are so important and integrated with women's issues that any feminist should feel compelled to get educated on these topics. Marcia Inhorn is very good at organizing class and leading discussions, and she brought snacks every week. You can tell that she's an instructor who is invested in her students' lives, and her selections for the class syllabus are really good. Professor Inhorn makes sure people keep up with the readings by having weekly reading responses and several book reviews, and I really got the sense that students were very invested in the course material. Overall, it was a good class, well-paced, not too difficult, and definitely opened my eyes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Take this course! Marcia is an amazing Professor and this study of masculinity studies can be so overlooked and is important to those interested in gender and health. To really get the most out of the class you have to do all the reading and commit to the discussions but you truly can get so much out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Marcia is amazing and I learned a lot throughout the course. The readings are all very interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Even if you think that you are more interested in women's health, this class is still such an important one to take! I learned so much more about health issues that I had only studied from one perspective in the past and now feel that I have a much better understanding of gender and health. This class provided me with a much more nuanced understanding of vulnerability, risk, and structural violence. The ethnographies alone make it worth the effort to take the class. You will come away with an appreciation for anthropology and how it is useful in non-academic settings. "
