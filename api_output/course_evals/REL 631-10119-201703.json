            "\u00a0Jane was an amazing teaching fellow. She is extremely knowledgeable and nice; she was really able to skillfully orient the class discussion without making it seem like she was lecturing during the discussion portion of our seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely phenomenal, very kind and gracious ",
            "\u00a0In many ways, Jane was an excellent teaching fellow.  She spoke clearly, she listened well, she made an effort to ensure all students were heard, and she was always prepared.  I think her biggest weakness arises out of her tact and desire to create a comfortable classroom environment: sometimes she was a bit timid.  It seemed like she kept a lot of her own thoughts in reserve and did not always tell us what she was thinking.  I would have liked to know more of what she thought about the authors that we read and for her to have guided the seminar more actively much of the time.  Overall, however, she was an excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: leading discussion in a way that was non threatening to a newcomer to ethics. You did a great job trying to include everyone. I really appreciated your feedback on my paper. It helped me change course for my next assignment and know how to improve\r\nWeaknesses: there were a few discussions that were dominated by one or two people and I would have loved tonchmage topic and vary the conversation ",
            "\u00a0Jane was always well prepared and was good at encouraging discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is a talented and wizened scholar.  Her knowledge and capability is clear in the classroom.  There were a few moments over the course of the semester when I felt conversation required a bit more direction, and I think Jane could have supplied it. ",
            "\u00a0Jane understands the material extremely well, and she guides discussions with helpful questions and comments which spur dialogue and are respectful to the interlocutors. ",
            "\u00a0Very good instructor, delicate and friendly. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is an outstanding TF. She is a born teacher: she explains complex material well, and never interrupted a student. She consistently sought out student understandings of the material and would gently nudge the conversation into a profitable direction. She balanced these two goals well. Her written comments were detailed. She made herself available for outside meetings. She, together with Prof. Eitel, were a terrific team. ",
            "\u00a0Jane is extraordinarily kind in her facilitation of discussion. She works to invite all voices to contribute to discussion, and she directs student attention to the text on its terms, not our terms. I appreciated how seriously she took each student comment and how careful she was to re-insert the question at hand or to add a question to invigorate discussion when it had waned. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Jane did a good job, she is bright, able to assert herself and to manage the assertions of others effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I appreciated having Jane as a TF. She was always very thoughful and poised when discussion got tense (which it did a few times). I wish that she had been a bit more hands-on at times. It would have been beneficial had she done more to briefly explain the readings (or do more to walk-through them with us) "
