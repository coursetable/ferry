            "\u00a0Critical thinking as it applies to conservation decision making, how to think and speak like a land trust, tons of land conservation knowledge, and a better perspective on how the field works. All highly practical, yet deeply rooted in philosophical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of how land trusts work and the different components required to make them successful. ",
            "\u00a0Great background to land conservation and land trust activities. Also includes a strong focus on the future of land protection and non-profit management. ",
            "\u00a0More experience with client interactions, how to handle those, etc. I learned a lot about the inner workings of land trusts and the skills and passions needed to operate one. It was a field I hadn't known much about before, so I was very glad I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was chock full of knowledge, skills, and insights.  Don't roll your eyes, but I learned all about different strategies for land conservation.  I learned the basics of conservation easements, land trusts, and various other players in land ownership and stewardship.  The presentations from all the different professionals were consistently mind-blowing.  The semester long project also gave me incredible insight into an incredibly important issue in northeast forest ownership dynamics, along with connecting me with forestry professionals throughout the region.  This is sure to be useful in my future career. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent coverage of varying goals and perspectives in the topic of US private lands conservation. Guest speakers brought great insight into how they do their own work, and how they think about conservation. Provided insight into the mechanics of conservation work as well as the goals, challenges, and achievements of the private lands conservation community. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep understanding of a broad range of topics in conservation by taking this course.  The knowledge and skills spanned academia and the professional world in a highly integrated, tangible, and practical way.  I learned all about land trusts, conservation easements, and the inter-workings of a wide range of conservation organizations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what public, private, and philanthropic funding for land conservation. I also learned some of the more nuanced issues surrounding these concepts. "

            "\u00a0So well! ",
            "\u00a0I was hoping the class would have more teaching compared to just a lecture series. Because of this there were some gaps in the content. However, I was exposed to a lot of the complexities of land trusts and met important people from the land trust community. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture component of the course was as expected and all of the guest speakers were great. The project was also largely what was expected, but with enough some unexpected experiences that made for good learning opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly. I got exactly what I wanted out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I had no idea what to expect from this course beyond a few encouraging remarks from my peers/mentors.  So maybe this isn't saying much, but the course blew away my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0The class was far more inspiring and enjoyable than I expected it to be. I learned a lot from class even during weeks where I had pretty low interest going into the week. Class time ended up being a highlight of my week, which I had not expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course exceeded my expectations. In terms of professional development, I feel that this course highly prepares students for careers in conservation. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned well, but I wish some more time had been spent on the basics instead of the nuanced issues (speaking as a complete beginner to conservation easements and land trusts). \r\n\r\nMy client project exceeded my expectations greatly! "

            "\u00a0I don't think I would change anything about the class. Maybe Brad could have lectured a bit more - he is incredible but we don't get to hear from him nearly enough! ",
            "\u00a0The opportunity to have all the guest speakers come in was amazing but a class of lectures leaves a need for synthesis and teaching. I could have gotten a lot more out of the guest speakers if there was structure for more formalized teaching and lectures by the professor. I feel like this class depends on the guest speakers and does not use them as a tool for learning. \r\n\r\nBrad is a wealth of knowledge and I want to learn more from him. Some guest speakers were \"wasted\" on teaching general information that Brad could have taught better and I would have liked to learn more about the experiences and case studies from those speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include all of the guest speakers and the opportunity to interact with land conservation professionals. The discussion component of the course occasionally struggled and could potentially be improved, but was potentially due to the smaller class size. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: guest speakers are engaging and interesting, and lend lots of differing perspectives all on the same subject. Class discussions are really engaging as well, make for an open learning environment. I felt very supported by the professor and the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the presentations.  The people that spoke to us are on the cutting edge of the field and had a lot of really cool experiences to share with us.  The semester project was also a strength, I learned a lot and contacted a ton of really great people.  However, I think this is variable depending on the project so make sure you get a good project!  The weaknesses weren't all that weak, but some of the readings were frivolous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\nVery well structured weekly class period and fantastic range of guest speakers. Plenty of chance to connect individually with the guest speakers before or after their presentations. Course topics were all related to one another and the knowledge built upon itself over the semester. \r\n\r\nSpeakers were very well chosen, came prepared, and almost always stayed on their promised topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nZero feedback on the Canvas written material we submitted each week, and zero feedback on the course project as it progressed. This meant that we never had any concept of what our grade in the course might be or how we were being judged.\r\n\r\nAllowing a non-student to start coming to the discussions halfway through the semester was a BAD idea. Scott didn't seem do the readings, did not do the same writeups the rest of us did, and only spoke from his own experience. He mainly just told long anecdotes that had little to do with the topic. His attitude was very condescending and pessimistic, and students couldn't really engage with him. It really detracted from the learning experience of several discussion periods. It's a mystery why one non-student was permitted to make such a big impact when other auditors were only allowed to come to the presentations.\r\n\r\nReadings for the week were sometimes completely unrelated to the speaker's topic. During discussion we almost never had any chance to discuss or process readings, instead focusing on the talks. Thus, time I spent on readings could feel like wasted time. \r\n\r\nOverly focused on conservation challenges in New England rather than all parts of the USA.\r\n\r\nSaturday workshops were unnecessary additions, especially the second one. ",
            "\u00a0I feel there is little that can be done to improve this course.   If there was more time it would have been nice to engage more with an international perspective. Also, further integration of Native American dialogue within the conservation perspective may be a valuable addition in future years. \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n-Class discussions covering the materials from the week prior allowed for me to fully engage within the topic each week. \r\n-Weekly guests whose professional roles spanned nearly every realm of conservation were very informative and expanded my professional network. \r\n-Class Project provided professional experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Great guest speakers with interesting insights\r\n-Great class structure for analysis and full digestion of speakers' insights\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not enough time to hear from Brad and learn from his expertise "

            "\u00a0The class is pretty specific - land conservation and mostly with private lands in the US. However, the insights you gain, discussions you have, and speakers you get to hear from are all second-to-none. Plus, there are weekly fancy dinners with the guest lecturers that you have the option of going on to get to know them more and learn from them. Take it, take it, take it! (If you're interested in the field). ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if you already know a lot about land trusts. \r\n\r\nThis class is also a great way to get client work experience with a relatively small time commitment (4hr a week). Any class with client work you end up learning a lot so this class is great for that! ",
            "\u00a0This is a very useful course for any land management professional and provides exposure to a broad spectrum of conservation issues. Additionally the opportunity to interact with land conservation professionals on a weekly basis is unique for FES courses. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in land ownership, management, or, yes, strategies for land conservation, take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Very worthwhile for anyone interested in US land conservation, especially private lands or public-private. Guest speakers are absolutely great and Gentry is a wonderful discussion leader. Expect to spend more time than you expect on the course week-to-week due to weekly writeup assignments, Saturday workshops, and optional dinners. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in becoming a conservation professional within the United States, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Pick a group project thoughtfully and aligned with specific skills you want to learn. The reward of these group projects can be very high if yo choose well. "
