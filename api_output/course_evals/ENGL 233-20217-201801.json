            "\u00a0* interdisciplinary and critical thinking skills across multi-media\r\n\r\n* collaboration skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned about whiteness as a theoretical and practical framework to examine race and racism in American society. I found the readings incredibly engaging throughout, and I enjoyed the opportunity to create a work that explored by own thoughts on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about techniques for analysis and ways to represent ideas and express concepts that I never thought could be portrayed in such creative ways. This class was challenging for me and very explorational, but I think it was an important class to take and I want to take more like this to further push myself. ",
            "\u00a0I had interesting conversations about my peers and we helped each other to better understand our own perspectives and experiences regarding whiteness. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop my skills in connecting theoretical readings to art forms and critiquing them. For the first time, I was able to discuss race and whiteness in a productive, respectful academic environment. This class really opened my eyes to a lot of nuances I'd never considered before. ",
            "\u00a0From this course, my ability to interrogate race, especially Whiteness, from both an artistic and a scholarly perspective was greatly increased by the projects and the course readings that were tailored to our interests and goals. I also improved in carrying out an artistic vision; the course gave me the structure and resources to complete a film from start to finish. "

            "\u00a0This is the best course I have taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this class is not the professor.  The focus is on each individual student, their needs, and the scholarship that supports those needs.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of course that makes the Yale experience unique.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on collaboration instead of competition is a breath of fresh air. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and creative final project were the strengths of the class. I think it could be improved with better organization of class time. I often wished we had more discussion in class instead of only the presentation of individual materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Claudia is brilliant, and many of my classmates also had insightful comments on each other's work. I looked forward to being in class every week.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was poorly organized in terms of how time was spent during the seminar, as well as the syllabus structure. The syllabus was essentially organized around students' projects, which while an interesting format was perhaps not the best way to cover an appropriately wide range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the diversity of its participants and of the readings, both in accessibility and in focus. Another was the structure in balancing both critical and artistic work. I think a weakness was the size of the class, because the material and projects were so engaging, there was never enough time to explore the intricacies. However, I do think it's good to give as many students as possible the opportunity to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of this class is fantastic, as we begin with some readings that bring everyone to at least the same base level of understanding and critical thinking about whiteness, mixed with discussion of our professor's own work. Then, as we got into the middle of the semester and putting together our projects I felt a little lost. The work we did to prepare for class had the possibility of relating to our individual projects, but because the readings were chosen by the students presenting there was a chance that it had only tangential relevance. To that degree, I found that a lot of the work I did mid-semester was just learning and thinking about others' projects, which left me very stressed about the state of my own. Of course, looking back on it it is clear that learning from each other's projects and the critiques/encouragement of those was a major part of the course, but in the moment I did at times wish for a more instructor-driven structure. I think what it comes down to is that the course truly treats you more as if you are an individual artist who is a part of a collective rather than a student who is there to discuss text and learn directly from it. It led to great learning by the end and a huge sense of satisfaction and opportunity for creativity, but I just wish I'd known to expect that from the start (and Professor Rankine warned us that that would be the case, but I guess I just didn't realize the full extent of what she meant).

            "\u00a0I not only would, I have!\r\n\r\nAlso, see my comments above about the nature of the course and how it is student centered. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the subject and would like to end with a creative final project, I highly recommend! There is a supportive class environment that I really appreciated. I also think the readings and my individual project helped shape a new way to think about race. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a fundamental course that would add a lot of value to your education. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it allows you to explore intellectually rigorous topics and readings creatively. I am passionate about the arts, so this was important to me. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This \"creative laboratory\" course was all about learning through the creative process while maintaining academic rigor. The professor truly felt like a creative collaborator, not an overseer. The final products were also all amazing and were a testament to the deep thought required to do this class successfully. ",
            "\u00a0This class is what you make of it. If you take the class and you are engaged in the readings and class discussions, you'll get a lot out of it, especially if you spend time refining your final project and taking Claudia's/your classmates' feedback. If you don't, then you're wasting an opportunity to learn from an incredible artist -- and your peers -- and you probably won't walk away feeling like you gained much. It's a self-motivated class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to work with other students and be vulnerable, make art. It is about a process; you will learn based on how much time you put into the class. If anything, you will learn your style and process in making art. ",
            "\u00a0I would, because I think every person living in America should interrogate Whiteness in relation to their own self-concept. I think anyone would leave this course with a new lens to analyze their world and the tools to bring those dynamics to light. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend if you are looking for the space to put together your own project, and are prepared for personal examination of self. The course really is designed so that you can spend your time working on what you want to work on and delving deeper into aspects of whiteness that interest you, but what that means is you must WANT to put in the time and effort, or else the exhibit will come and you will not be done or you will end up sharing work you are not proud of. For me, the class was great because I got to learn from the projects of others and how they could be improved/how they grew over the course of the semester while also channeling this knowledge into my own work and seeing how my own visions for what whiteness meant to me and how that manifested in my project changed too, but for someone looking to learn more about whiteness in a seminar setting who lacks a pretty extensive understanding already-- this is NOT the course for you.
