            "\u00a0What a useful introduction to GIS! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great crash course to learning ArcGIS. I tried to learn on my own and was not able to, so this course was an excellent introduction. ",
            "\u00a0I guess I kinda be of learned how to use GIS, but I found the class to be very confusing and not the helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I gained practical, technical skills in ArcGIS and got experiential practice employing the technology on a project of personal interest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use ArcMap and what rasters and vectors are and how they can be manipulated. ",
            "\u00a0The course was an excellent introduction to ArcGIS, focusing on ArcMap, ArcScene, and ArcCatalog. The course covered a lot and the professor was extremely knowledgeable on the subject. "

            "\u00a0Professor Tomlin mostly just lectures for the entire two hours. Although he's incredibly knowledgeable, it ultimately makes for a very boring class. This class could be improved by adding more class participation. ",
            "\u00a0Though Professor Tomlin is really knowledgeable, the class was hard to learn from because we got literally no feedback until the final grade. For example, I am writing this review having received zero grades or feedback of any kind in the class. ",
            "\u00a0One class strength was that the lectures were interesting, which is impressive for fairly dry subject matter. Also, it prioritized experimentation and learning through practice, which is important in a course. However, we received no feedback during the entire semester, which is unacceptable. I had no idea if I was on the right track, or what I could be doing better. This is disappointing because the professor promised feedback on multiple occasions. ",
            "\u00a0We spend a bit too much time at the beginning not doing GIS or just doing the silly draw tool which almost nobody will use later. I think we could've made a lot more meaningful progress if we started doing work in it right away. To summarize, the main weakness is that this class has a very slow start.\r\n\r\nStrengths: you're learning from an expert who is very good at explaining all these concepts. The projects are cool as well. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Tomlin and his worksheets were wonderful. He was very approachable, and his worksheets explained all the topics covered in class (and several topics not covered!). "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if a student has a great interest in maps and data presentation. Otherwise, the course offers no engagement with any other material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to someone who can intuit ways to make software work for them, or someone with patience to hack away. ",
            "\u00a0If a student wants to learn ArcGIS, this is the course! There couldn't be a better intro class or professor. "
