            "\u00a0This is the first class I've ever taken in which the instructor trained me to read for craft and technique rather than semantics, meaning, and abstract principles. I now feel much more confident in my ability to parse apart the craft of a piece and appreciate it even if I don't agree with its content or feel the piece is super interesting, and much more confident in my own assessments of the quality of a piece of writing. The workshop process also allowed me to feel comfortable with sharing my work with others for critique as well as critique others' work from various angles. I also learned how to write fast, and how to be okay with scrapping a draft and starting nearly anew for a revision. Never before had I really written or thought I'd enjoy writing creative nonfiction, but I do, and will keep writing even after this class has ended. BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. SARACENI (absolute sweetheart) IF YOU CAN. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a compelling, substantive essay. The readings, compounded with the extensive amount of writing assignments helped improve upon my own authorial voice while also drawing on the rhetorical techniques of the world's best essayists. Comparing my writing from the beginning of the term till now. I can confidently say its quality has improved exponentially. If you're willing to take on this course's rigor, you will undoubtedly be a better writer because of it. ",
            "\u00a0The main things I gained from this course were learning how to change the process that I write and learning about authors whose voice I could emulate in the future. The frequency of the writing assignments forced me to invest more time in my writing and learn that good writing is really a process of rewriting. I also learned the importance of intense thinking prior to writing an essay and the importance of receiving peer feedback, either from fellow workshoppers or the CTL, in editing essays. Revising and brainstorming for writing became less of changing sentences on a paper and instead changing the thoughts behind the paper. ",
            "\u00a0I've become a much better and more confident writer after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Through this amazing course, I have learned how to more clearly and creatively articulate my thoughts, whether that be in the form of a story, an op-ed, or even a humor piece. It has been such a valuable experience to be able to study and emulate techniques from a myriad of phenomenal writers that I otherwise would not have known about. This course gave me the creative freedom to say what was important to me in a way in which people would be willing to read and listen and I really appreciated being able to develop that skill. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze works and extract techniques that made the essays successful and apply them to my own work. I read a wide range of non-fiction and through that began to craft my own style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the craft that goes into writing the modern essay. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course I am much more confident writing a short essay in several different styles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read for craft. I gained the ability to recognize moments in a text where an author exerts influence on the reader using various tools, and practiced implementing those tools into my own writing. I learned to love the exacting science of writing along with its abstract components. The release felt from finding the exact word to move your thoughts to paper is exhilarating. I consider myself a much better writer, with improved clarity and simplicity of style. "

            "\u00a0I adore this class so, so, so, so much. Each class session is either a full class discussion roundtable or an essay workshop, and I have never found myself bored at any point in the semester. The true strength of this course is Professor Saraceni, who works hard to craft a sense of closeness, camaraderie, and community in our class such that we students have become close friends who aren't afraid to both agree with and refute each others' ideas during discussion. She opens up her office hours almost every day of the week, responds extensively via email, and always provides full comments on drafts and revisions that help us not only work on the current paper at hand, but also extract techniques and analytical skills for use in future papers and in writing in general. I can think of no weaknesses save for the fast pace of writing in this class, which is 1) inevitable because ENGL 120, and 2) less of a weakness and more of a strength in that it pushed me to write fast but also write well, even if there were perhaps many sleepless Saturday nights (papers were always due Sunday). ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths include the incredibly interesting assigned readings, Professor Saraceni's engaging seminar discussions, and the super helpful bi-weekly workshops. Each of these components benefit each other and help the course realize its ultimate goal of making confident writers. Its honestly very hard to find a weakness in this class. If anything, the discussion format might feel repetitive to some, but the readings are diverse enough to keep students on their toes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the breadth and depth of writing forms discussed. We examined five different styles of writing from personal experiences to humor, each unit comprised of at least five or more diverse readings. The variety of readings allowed us to try to find at least one writer whose voice and style we could emulate. \r\n\r\nSome ways this course could be improved would be eliminating or drastically shortening the number of antique essays (like those of George Orwell) simply because their styles are very difficult to emulate, especially if their content matter is not immediately relevant. While I do think it is important to study the literary techniques of older authors, I do think that it should be noted that they are difficult to emulate in college student writing, especially given the limited page count of the papers we can write. In a similar vein, I would place more emphasis on shorter essays whose length more closely resembled those of the assignments. While it's helpful to learn techniques from a ten-plus page essay, it's hard to emulate the structure of it simply because that author has more space to expand. Thus, I would absolutely love to see more student-written essays and how past ENGL 120 students have practically tackled these forms of writing. Finally, I would like to see more analysis of the concrete rhetorical techniques these authors used to improve their writing. While I do think it's important to analyze macro-level decisions by these authors to see how they crafted their pieces, I think analyzing more small, more applicable techniques would be worthwhile to the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great! It was well-organized and I never felt that we were moving too fast. I enjoyed reading and discussions, and the workshops were all extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was being able to read so many different captivating pieces of writing throughout the course. They were often very interesting and fun to read which helped to make the class more enjoyable. The workshop sessions were also extremely helpful in hearing other people's suggestions to improve my own writing and to hear more ideas that I could use in my writing. I also appreciated being able to read and write so many different types of pieces, from personal narratives to profiling a person to even a humor piece. It made me think more creatively and switch gears.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the amount of time we had for each piece. Only being able edit my draft once was a bit unfortunate, as I would have liked to have more time to improve upon my writing. However, I understand that that is due to the limited amount of time we have and I'm not sure what a solution could be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Analysis of the works, the reading aspect of the course\r\nWeaknesses: Bridging the gap between analysis of the reading to the writing ",
            "\u00a0This course enables you to write about many different non-fiction genres special to you like a place, a personal narrative, and even humor. \r\nWorkshops helped us to learn more about each other and to think about the craft that went into our own essays. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives students many opportunities to write, which is essential to the growth of a writer's ability. It also demands a high level of engagement with a wide variety texts inside and outside of the classroom. These texts come from a diverse set of authors, including Yale professors, op-ed columnists, food critics, white men and women, black men, Latina women, etc. This was a very well-designed course.\r\nAfter the class ended, I read more of the essays included in the Norton reader, and I really wish we had read and discussed George Orwell's \"Politics and the English Language,\" Zora Hurston \"How it Feels to be Colored Me,\" and anything by James Baldwin. I am sure it is difficult to fit all of the readings you want to discuss into a semester, but I felt the course sorely missed a learning experience by not having these inclusions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great teacher. Great readings. Improve your writing. Open discussions that are easy to jump into. Individual attention to your writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very time consuming. Readings could have be more diverse. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES. TAKE THIS CLASS (especially with Professor Saraceni). You write a ton (which makes for a busy semester), read a ton (but each piece is so interesting that nobody is ever willing to just skim them...), make a ton of friends (our class is ridiculously tightknit), and develop a very personal relationship with English language as well as with Professor Saraceni as a professor and a mentor. Best class I've ever had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend ENGL 120 with Professor Saraceni. The readings are incredible and the writing assignments are broad enough so that you can tackle them in your own unique way. If you decide to take this course, you are going to become a more confident writer. But beyond that, this class surprised me with how positive it was as a learning environment. The students were genuinely interested in each other's success in the class, and finding a space like that on campus is hard to come by. If you're seriously considering ENGL 120 and are on the fence, I urge you to take it. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because while writing less academic essays may not be applicable to other courses here at Yale, I do think a lot of the skills gained from taking this writing course, such as the importance of thinking, structuring, and working through the entire multiple-week process of rewriting essays and brainstorming is universal. Already, I have seen improvements in my writing in other course-based papers  mostly, because this course teaches you how to think, which helps everywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I didn't think I was a very strong writer before taking this class but I still enjoyed it a lot (it was one of my favorite courses here). Prof. Saraceni is great as well. I really enjoyed reading all the essays we were assigned and although writing was a bit stressful, it was a great experience. Compared to other english classes, 120 also gives you a lot more freedom as a writer - you can choose your own topics within a certain genre. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was fun and it has helped me improve my writing skills significantly. It is for anyone who wants to better articulate their thoughts and opinions and it is for any student in any major. A student taking this course would not regret taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! Through 120, I became a much more confident writer. The course also was extremely enjoyable.  The students in the classroom were nearly always engaged and that fostered very rich discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with Professor Saraceni. She is always open to feedback, gives insightful comments, and helps you to be a better writer with each essay. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class as a senior CS major and think I got a lot out of it. I usually dread writing essays, but the essays for this class were creative and fun to write. Also, this class gave me more confidence writing because we spent a ton of time talking about specific styles and structures. The readings were manageable and interesting so it's easy to do all of them. I definitely recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0I think everybody should take English 120, and I think almost every student can enjoy taking English 120. You get to read incredibly interesting essays, but instead of analyzing the content as one is used to in English courses, the craft is analyzed. This slight shift of perspective makes the content feel completely fresh and exciting. You learn so many new exciting things about words and how they work together to form larger structures, and how these structures can be used to influence the reader. The seminar classes are so close-knit, and you get to learn so much about your peers through their writing. It is a fantastic experience. ",
            "\u00a0I wrote a really long paragraph about why people should take English 120, but it didn't save after an attempted submission. As a quick summary: If you want to take a writing credit that will legitimately improve you're writing, take English 120. If you are afraid of the time commitment, you won't regret the effort you put into this class. If you don't have room for it your first or second year, it's okay as I had juniors and seniors in my class. "
