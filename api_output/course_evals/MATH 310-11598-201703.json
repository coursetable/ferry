            "\u00a0Just as the course title indicates, I gained introductory knowledge about complex analysis.  Results proved and worked with in the class included the Cauchy Integral Formula, Rouch's Theorem, Jensen's Formula, and Weierstrass' Infinite Product Theorem ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole bunch of complex analysis (and some real analysis along the way, which I hadn't taken before). I think we didn't cover some topics that are usually covered, like homotopies, but we also talked about entire functions at the end, which was pretty cool. ",

When Stefan taught the course he emphasized basic fluency in mathematics independent of complex analysis (a lot of complex analysis is basically just analysis). ",

            "\u00a0I felt like I didn't learn very much from this course. We covered a few pretty basic theorems and their simple applications. However, exams seemed to prize regurgitation of class material over actual understanding of that material, so I ended up studying by memorizing everything that was done in class rather than learning the content as best as I could. ",

I'm not sure I gained any intuition with working in the complex plane or complex-valued functions. I certainly didn't gain any wider mathematical or logical insights. ",
            "\u00a0With Stefan (very important to note, because I feel the material was covered in a rather non-standard way), I really came out understanding why complex analysis is considered so \"magical\". With that comes a /lot/ of theory that was crammed into my brain over the course of the semester. Fortunately, I think I managed to retain a lot of it, especially the motivations--really cool stuff. Since the theory was both deep and dense, I feel like I spent a little less time internalizing the mechanics, which is probably bad (did bite me in the butt on the exams), but I feel like that stuff can be figured out when the real need arises--no regrets.

            "\u00a0This is easily one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. The content is fascinating, well-connected, and nicely contained within itself. This class will make you understand the universe more deeply. That being said, the class was disorganized and confusing. Professor had bad handwriting and often went too quickly. Difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Complex analysis is awesome!  That said, lectures were sometimes disorganized, and problem sets were often only tangentially related to what we did in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The homeworks were pretty straightforward. Stefan's an interesting guy and makes lectures somewhat worth going to, but still follows Stein and Shakarchi closely enough. Ultimately, it seemed pretty par for the course for a math course. Not to be too mean, but the grading on homework was inconsistent, to say the least. I recognize that grading isn't easy, but it would have been nice to get quick and, more crucially, accurate feedback on homework. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very nicely structured and organized, but could benefit from a more clear presentation of the material. ",
            "\u00a0At this point complex analysis appears to me to be this dark and shapeshifting object the understanding of which can be achieved only through the examination of very specific parts of it in some sequence---never all together---like trying to get to know a person by looking at their pinkie and then sniffing their earlobe and then asking them one question---and so on.\r\n\r\nWhich is to say it would have been nice for someone to take the damn bag off my head and show me here is the thing in its entirety, birds eye and all, and there's this and that's that and the general landscape of the field is as such so on and so forth, which may not be possible given the actual NATURE of the thing but I'm a big picture guy so---? ",
            "\u00a0Material was covered exceedingly quickly, and we were expected to understand an entire new topc from 10 minutes of electure and one homework problem and then have thorough knowledge. Also, I wish the imprtance of each topic was told so we understood why we were leanrning it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course hinge a lot on the fact that the subject matter is so interesting.  If you are interested in mathematics, complex analysis is super beautiful and has some striking results that apply not only to the complex plane but also to the real line.\r\n\r\nI thought the biggest weakness of the course was the problem sets.  They weren't very motivating, and sometimes involved very esoteric examples.  Often, it didn't feel like I was broadening or improving my understanding of the subject when working on them, but that I was just solving something to solve it and finish my homework.  Furthermore, I didn't think the course gave a good enough conceptual understanding of complex functions.  I wish I knew more how trigonometric functions and simple polynomials actually mapped the complex numbers.  Sometimes, when trying to solve problems involve roots, I would rely too much on the shapes these functions make on the real line, when obviously it is very very different when extended to the complex plane.  This would often hinder my ability to work through proofs, because I would keep getting confused about the basic shapes of the functions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the topic is VERY cool. The problem sets were exciting, and did a good job of introducing more cool facts while drawing on concepts from class. Stefan was also really enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and receptive to student input. However, class lectures were sometimes hard to follow, because it was not clear what statements we were proving, what statements were assumed, when we were proving a lemma for the main proof or the actual proof, or if the main proof was over and we were on a whole new topic. Stefan also often got really excited about a concept and  hand-waved a proof, sometimes without writing anything down -- it was usually a little confusing. I think exams also could be improved -- problems were usually either very easy, very hard, or just required memorizing some proof from class. It's probably hard to come up with medium-level questions, but I think the easy problems could be made slightly harder, and the hard problems could be made slightly easier (for example, making the bonus questions actual test questions, but splitting them into parts a-c, where each part has a small hint of the next step, like in the HW). Finally, some questions were repeated between exams, which I think would be slightly more reasonable in the future if students can get physical copies of the exams back. ",
            "\u00a0The exams seemed mostly impossible to study for, especially when the advice for studying from the professor was \"know everything really well\" ",
            "\u00a0lectures could be more organized. better feedback on the psets would be nice ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: doing the problem sets really teaches one the material, many topics covered ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum was incredibly disorganized. There was no logical progression to the topics we learned. In fact, it seemed as though Stefan chose a textbook topic at random and went on with regurgitating the textbook. He was a fantastic lecture but outside of lecture it was very difficult to learn course material because I didn't know what we covered. ",
            "\u00a0The homework was almost always useful and interesting, though the graders were extremely slow about getting it back to us. The lectures were interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture (Stefan is very good). He is good at keeping us entertained (read: engaged) and at forcing us to become competent in mathematics (independently of learning complex analysis).\r\n\r\n\tWeaknesses: Maybe you could emphasize computation a little more? Stuff like the what was on the \"meta\" pset. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course were the subject matter as well as the textbook. The subject itself was very interesting and made me want to learn about it, and the book was one of the better math textbooks since it really helped clarify the topics discussed in class. The main weakness of the class was that the lectures were hard to follow and were not very organized. We jumped from chapter to chapter in the book which made it hard to sometimes put things together. The lectures were also very disorganized and the professor was not great at addressing people's specific questions. ",
            "\u00a0Stefan is a very fun professor, and that was the primary strength of this class, and he clearly cares a lot about making sure students understand the material he covered. However, he cuts corners in some ways -- I really wish pset solutions had been posted, for example. Also, the exams stress regurgitation of class material rather than genuine understanding, which led to me being frustrated while studying for exams and not learning as much as I'd hoped. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Stein and Shakarchi is a good textbook - the problems are the right level of difficulty, the proofs are almost universally clear and concise, the material is presented in a logical order. The problem sets were fine - I learned applications of the material presented in class by doing them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Stefan's presentation of the material was disorganized (a decent amount of every class was spent not doing complex analysis), some of his proofs were confusing, his refusal to post solutions to the homeworks made studying for tests harder.\r\n\r\nThe tests were probably the largest weakness of the course - they rewarded knowing weird exceptions to conditions in which we used various theorems in class through multiple choice questions and knowledge of the proofs of statements rather than ability to actually use complex analysis to solve problems. Furthermore, Stefan's grading did not offer any opportunities for improvement - you either got full credit, even when what you wrote was mostly incoherent but contained enough truth, or you got no credit whatsoever and no explanation of why. ",
            "\u00a0I'll start with the perceived shortcomings. Many will say that the lectures were highly disorganized, but I'd say it was more that they were very, very fast-paced, and you could easily whiz past the entire build-up and reveal of a great revelation like Cauchy's Integral Formula and basically never really come back to the magical explanation again. Stefan is a smart guy, so he kinda expects, or at least pretends to expect, a deep understanding and ease of manipulation with all the big things in lecture on the psets, which he comes up with himself, especially for the hardest questions. This is usually ok with a friendly-paced class, but we go through way too many \"big things\" each week, which can feel like mental overload sometimes.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd say that, looking past my probably-destroyed GPA, it was a trial-by-fire experience that I was really looking for by consciously taking a Stefan class, and I am very much satisfied. Stefan himself is a super-duper approachable guy who untangled up a bunch of conceptual knots that I had. His tests are also probably fair--they seem pretty easy and computational compared to the homework, and some questions literally come from it, but the breadth of the material sometimes makes it hard to study effectively for it, and we really don't get too much practice in computation during class or on the homework.

More importantly, Stefan is very good at instilling a sense of why math is interesting and transcendent as opposed to just being like \"I like solving problems.\" Also complex analysis is far and away the most interesting subject in math I've taken so far. Highly recommend. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend Complex Analysis as a topic. The material is both interesting and useful (although to be honest I still prefer the types of proof that one does in algebra classes). Stefan is an ok teacher. His tests are not easy, but they are manageable if you do one thing: memorize every proof that is done in class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it iff you like analysis and have the time to read the book (Stein) on your free time ",
            "\u00a0Yes, complex analysis is essential for any math major. ",
            "\u00a0My strong recommendation is to not take this course. If you do, beware that your only hope is to be incredibly gifted mathematically, or for Stefan to have changed fundamentally. Stefan is intelligent. However, he has a lot of work to do to become a passable teacher. \r\n\r\nFor starters, Stefan used the word \"retarded\" on six occasions over the course of two lectures in October, referring to ideas represented in the classroom. This is 100% unacceptable, and I feel terribly for the students in the classroom who were antagonized both directly and indirectly by these childish and unprofessional outbursts.\r\n\r\nStefan has an aggressive and oppressive approach to teaching. For instance, he will start each lecture with a call for questions or comments on previous lectures; if someone asks a question, his response is as monosyllabic and glib as possible, perhaps in a fruitless attempt to illustrate the simplicity of the matter (from his perspective.) If pressed, he will utter more syllables, and perhaps use the board to review the material; but he does so with eye rolls and groans and absolutely no intent to help the student. The impression is that this is the Stefan show. We are his audience, and he is the hip, edgy, young artist whose laziness and disrespect for the act of teaching we are supposed to overlook.\r\n\r\nHis approach to the material outside of \"answering\" questions is very similar. Explanations are omitted, statements sped through, and confusion ignored. He takes the top two-three students' nods as an indication that all is well and it's time to move on. When prompted by exasperated students to slow down, he becomes condescending in his compliance. \r\n\r\nIn keeping with the characteristic of aggression, Stefan has never accepted responsibility for his faults when things go wrong or when problems arise in the class. In every case, Stefan has blamed the students for all of these problems. For instance, several students in the class pointed out to Stefan that the class's graders marked ideas and methods as \"correct\" on the problem sets, even though when the students applied those methods on the first midterm, they did not receive even partial credit for those components of their responses. Stefan's response was, paraphrasing: \"This is unacceptable if it is true. If you want anything to be done about this, then compile a list of grievances in the problem sets and present me with that list, or else nothing can be done.\" This is simply a lazy lie. His approach was to say that it is the student's responsibility to correctly grade their own p-sets and then evaluate the accuracy of the paid graders' subsequent corrections. The responsibility for ensuring accurate grading does not fall on the student. It is Stefan's, and Stefan stubbornly refused to accept this responsibility.\r\n\r\nLastly, Stefan intentionally adopted a grading method that is inconsistent with the norm. He refused to curve exams or to give partial credit, saying, quote, \"There is no partial credit in the Old Country\" (referring to Austria). The phrase \"back in the Old Country\" indeed came up on innumerable occasions as justification for his harsh approaches. The reality is that what goes on the transcript of a Yale student is seen through the filter of Yale's standard grading method. To use a different grading method is fine, but only if every teacher at Yale did so. Otherwise, a dedicated and successful students lone C on their transcript is seen as a shockingly poor performance.\r\n\r\nI hope that Stefan does change some of his approach, and that this course (or any he teaches) is accordingly made more effective, accessible, respectful, and appropriate for Yale University. I am optimistic that this can happen down the road. But until it does, do not take a course taught by Stefan. This is coming from a math major with great interest in complex analysis who did well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if Stefan is not teaching it. Complex analysis of functions is a beautiful and well-covered genre of mathematics, and I highly encourage any math major to learn about it. ",
            "\u00a0Complex Analysis with Stefan was very fun. It's a beautiful and exceedingly useful field of mathematics -- whether you're a math major or a physics major or an engineering major, you should consider taking the course. Stefan was always an engaging lecturer, although his explanation of the subject matter was less clear at times than I would have liked. He did a great job of conveying the \"big picture\" behind the subjects he was teaching us, but he tended to skip over details, and this often made him hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Complex analysis is an amazing topic, but I would wait until someone besides Stefan is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are a physics major and planning on grad school you have to take this course. Go ahead and take it credit/D, just be sure you come out understanding residue calculus. ",
            "\u00a0As a topic in math, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a very interesting subject and is very different from any math course I've taken. As a class though, it was very disorganized and hard to follow which meant you were mostly teaching yourself. If you're okay with spending a lot of time out of class to learn the material, then this class would work fine for you. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course. If you're interested in learning complex analysis, you can read the first couple chapters of our textbook yourself and learn the same material much quicker than we did. The class felt a lot like high school Algebra 2, where succeeding meant knowing how to do all the types of problems you could be given. Except in MATH 310, there's both \"types of problems\" and \"types of proofs\", where the proofs you could be given were all taken directly from class. While most math classes expect novel thinking on the exam, this course's exams were just regurgitation of class notes. ",
            "\u00a0If Stefan improves his tests and makes his in-class proofs clearer, take this class. If someone other than Stefan teaches the class, take this class unless the teacher is notoriously bad. Complex analysis is a really beautiful and deep subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this. I will probably look back a few years from now and see that the semester that I took complex analysis is where it all started (albeit by putting me through a meat grinder). "
