            "\u00a0Strengths- The course is small, a lot of engagement/speaking with other students + personal feedback\r\nWeakness- I did not like that this course scheduled assessments/presentations on the week back from Fall Break and Thanksgiving Break... I don't think that was very accommodating to students or allowed them to really take a real break. I also think the extra commitments- hebrew tables, class events- should be more optional. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a really unique semester long focus on social businesses in Israel and in New Haven which makes it super interesting. The course itself is centered around future tense and an assortment of vocabulary themes. There is some busy work for homework, but overall everything we do in class is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It should meet everyday. It should also focus more on the concepts of Hebrew grammar rather than just pure memorization. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would be better if it met every day ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class was very organized and homework assignment worksheets were very helpful. I think it could have used more talking opportunities that were part of class. The class had a lot of outside of class time commitments that proved hard to satisfy but were the best parts of the class (movie, talking sections). ",
            "\u00a0The main issue with the course, as I see it, is that there are regular hours kept by the course which are not stated on the ocs page. That caused a few scheduling issues. Other than that, twas very pleasant. "

            "\u00a0If you want to take Hebrew, yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class to learn Hebrew. ",
