            "\u00a0I think that Prof. Hu is a very knowledgeable lecturer and gave lectures that were decently clear and engaging. I think he was a little disorganized on the course assignments, not giving very clear feedback and prescribing homework on top of essays instead of spreading them out -- but on the other hand, he was very understanding with deadlines, so it evened out. \r\n\r\nI think Prof. Hu should spend a little more time on fundamentals and should definitely give a little more attention to sign conventions. The course covers a number of sub-fields, each of which has its own conventions. They tended to bleed together a little in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that many topics are covered but the weakness is that the course is a little hard to catch everything up. ",

            "\u00a0The strength is that professor hu knows these fields very well.\r\nThe weakness is that it covers materials too fast ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized. The contents were highly relevant and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It went a bit too fast and could be hard to follow. Going slower, through fewer topics, and having more review would be extremely helpful. Also, more homework would be helpful for learning how to use the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and covered each topic thoroughly and at a good pace. The course could be improved by having more on-board examples and derivations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include thorough presentation of class material, as well as good flow. A lot of material on some of the electronic processes involved in photochemical methods, semiconductors, electrochemical cells, and energy evaluation methods.\r\n\r\nNo significant weaknesses, just sometimes a lot of material all at once "
