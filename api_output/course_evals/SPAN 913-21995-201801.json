            "\u00a0We covered everything from the origins of the magical realism genre to One Hundred Years of Solitude by Garca Mrquez and theory by Lezama Lima. An in depth discussion of many Cuban writers was had as well. I learned that magical realism is far from a fantastic, whimsical genre. It is grounded in a different conception of space and time which relies heavily on the unconscious and ancestral relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Taking Professor Gonzlez-Echevarras Magical Realism class enabled me to acquire comprehensive, intertextual and interdisciplinary knowledge and understanding about this important literary genre within Latin America. "

        [
            "\u00a0Readings could be specified more clearly, but apart from that, this was an excellent course. "

            "\u00a0YES! This is a gem of a course. For those of you who enjoy exciting readings that force you to suspend your disbelief in order to learn something profound about yourself and your connection to your family and culture, this is the class for you. We read everything from legends to stories to novels to theory. One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of my new favorites, along with Leyendas de Guatemala by Asturias. The discussion and stories that Gonzlez Echevarra provides are among the most fun and informative you will find. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues, since they would be able to acquire a unique, interdisciplinary and intercultural understanding, and in fact learn, the fundamental definition of Magical Realism as a literary genre. "
