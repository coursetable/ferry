            "\u00a0The professor and TFs are super nice and helpful to answer questions. The biggest weakness of the course is just that it gets really hard really fast, and if you don't have a coding background, there's a steep learning curve. Without office hours or friends in the class, I would have not been able to complete most of the last few homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The notes were incredibly comprehensive, so sometimes it didn't feel necessary to go to class. However, Susan is a FANTASTIC professor and this is simply a reflection of how organized she is, because when you do go to lecture you probably get a better understanding of the class far quicker than if you just read the notes.

I know this would incentivize students not to come to class, but for me personally, when I was in class and something wouldn't work in R, I would basically be left behind. Until I figured it out, (more importantly, IF I figured it out) I would desperately have to try and catch up to where we were in the lecture. This left me not able to understand many important concepts and operations in R. ",

            "\u00a0Class moved very quickly, and it was very easy to get lost if you fell behind by even a few lines of code. Often times the problem sets were very challenging and seemed beyond our own skill sets without a lot of help from the TAs. I feel that many simpler questions would have proven more useful than fewer harder ones, as the most difficult ones are based on skills I still don't feel I've mastered. However, I still loved the course. I appreciated how knowledgeable the instructor was and how she worked to give us an understanding of not only the coding, but also the statistical inference behind what we were doing. ",
            "\u00a0The way that the code was taught during lecture helped me learn very well. But also, perhaps there could be greater space for students to learn on their own and apply what they learned on open-ended projects. The problem sets challenged me to learn and apply and reinforced lectures very well. But because they were structured and guided, I was unable to use my skills in a more real-world setting. ",
            "\u00a0Susan is a very clear lecturer and everything you will need for the homework or exams will be in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wang has the best voice ever - I had to wake up at 9am, granted I was late most days, but I went just to hear her voice. I wonder if I can have her voice as my alarm in the morning. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fun, informative class, and taught me a lot about data analysis and how to work with big data sets. The lectures were always clear and seemed to linearly follow from the last class, and the problem sets were structured well to help cement ideas from class. As someone who was already familiar with R, it was a good brush up on how to use it, and introduced me to more helpful packages. My only suggestion would be to not have the class at 9am. ",
            "\u00a0It was really useful to learn R. ",
            "\u00a0Very organised class. All homeworks and solutions are posted online - so are the exams and their solutions. Exams are fair. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-taught and well-organized. The problem sets were well devised and very useful to learn from--they took the right amount of time each week, while touching upon all the important topics we needed to cover. I also liked how we pivoted towards more open-ended interpretation of data sets over time. My only critique would be that it would be helpful to have a bigger room for office hours, since most of the office hours sessions I attended were quite crowded. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly well structured, each lecture having clear learning objectives and new data sets to analyze. I appreciate the structure of the class with weekly problem sets that allow us to apply and deepen our understanding of the concepts covered in class, and two midterms (as opposed to a midterm and a final). I have very little reservations as to the structure of the course, but I would like to see the lectures become a little more interactive. It would be nice if Professor Wang could give some time each class (maybe at the beginning?) to try to solve a problem to apply what we learned last lecture, or ask more questions along the way to see if we understand how to apply these new techniques. Otherwise, each lecture was well led and very informative, and Im really happy to have taken this course! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were generally engaging and easy to follow along with. The psets were well designed to reinforce concepts and help prepare us for the exams (they are challenging but not too time-consuming). One point of improvement is that the class notes on Canvas often repeat sections from the previous lecture and are named for either a data set or a concept covered; it makes it pretty difficult to go back and try to find a specific topic in the notes. The course is also focused (in my view) much more on learning the computing and on large-scale data operations like cleaning and plotting; I would have liked to delve a little bit deeper into the statistics, because it doesn't cover much more than intro stats does. ",
            "\u00a0One major weakness was that it is such a huge lecture. I wish that it was split into 4 different sections. I would pay attention more if I was in a smaller class. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a lot of interesting and important material. I also enjoyed working through the psets. However, I did think that the lectures moved too fast, and it was hard to follow along with Prof. Wang. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been a couple optional sections on statistics that summarized the statistics we learned while working in R. Overall this class was very straightforward and made the learning very fun! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Doable, interesting problem sets, Professor Wang (Susan) is excellent, daily office hours, manageable exams, and engaging lectures where you follow Susan in R programming\r\nWeaknesses: If you fall behind in the R coding during class it can be hard to catch up, since all the code builds on the code before it. The midterm is heavy on coding, so that must be practiced a lot (which I believe can distract from understanding the statistical concepts) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- you do end up learning R pretty well if you go to lecture and do the psets \r\n- material was interesting \r\n- semester was well-structured \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- exams did not test skills well \r\n- class could have been more interactive even if it was a lecture ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the content of the course and thought that it was taught very well. The course was well organized, but I think that it would have been helpful to separate statistical content from the implementation in R. I often felt that we would review the intuition behind certain statistical tests as we were using them in R, so sometimes it felt a bit repetitive and not fully cohesive, but I think it would have been clearer to first review the material and then go over different examples of how to use these tests in R. ",
            "\u00a0Cant think of any obvious weaknesses, strengths are that it is very clearly-taught with fair assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures moved way too fast. Both in the sense that Professor Wang just spoke and typed very quickly and it was very difficult to keep up and pay attention, and in the sense that there was a ton of new material covered each lecture. I had to skip a handful of lectures early in the semester for personal reasons and I was never really able to catch back up witht the rest of the class. For some people, psets were a piece of cake and for others we'd spend many hours trying to make the smallest dent in them. If you're predisposed to CS, then this class might be easy for you. If you're not, then you're going to have a very hard time but it might still be worth it if you're willing to put in the time. Either way, I regret taking it in a 5-class semester. Psets were also graded very harshly.\r\n \r\n**Important note:  if you're considering taking this after having taken S&DS 100, know that this class presupposes a ton of knowledge that was NOT covered in 100. You finish the 100 curriculum after about the first month, and then it's all new material + all the coding. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wang was an excellent lecturer - very clear and to-the-point. The class was very well organized and it was easy to find resources. Piazza was really useful.\r\n\r\nThe office hours were a little bit unstructured, and it was difficult to ask basic questions ",

            "\u00a0The course is well organized, with weekly PSets and very fair exams (midterm and final). One weakness was the speed/amount of material covered. I definitely found myself barely following certain lectures and feeling that I'm digging through a lot of information when approaching PSets. This could be improved through limiting/focusing material a little more. ",

Planning on taking other courses that use it to keep my skills up.\r\n\r\nI would say in the future to cut out the dplyr section. It is not a critical part of R and is essentially just a fancier way to do the things we'd already learned. I felt I was just getting comfortable with the normal way before when we started dplyr and I had to relearn everything I'd just spent months learning to do. Further, the TAs said they didn't use the dplyr format at all, they hadn't used it since learning back when they took 230 so given that it seems to not be used outside this class I feel it would be better to spend more time on the basics at the beginning (since it is an intro class) or explore a different advanced topic (maybe get into non-linear regression on R or something) ",

The exams did not feel like they reflected the majority of the course, but I guess that is the nature of handwritten CS exams. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Wang was really engaging and really clear as a lecturer. It was always easy to go back to the notes to revise the techniques learnt. Weakness: Could do a bit more emphasis on the interpretations of various statistical tests. It was sometimes easy to miss it during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter taught in this course is all very relevant for day-to-day data analysis and visualization. We explored a variety of relevant data sets concerning traffic stops in CT, blockbuster movies, American time use surveys, and more to investigate police bias in traffic stopping, predictors for high-grossing films, breakdown of social time among young adults, and more. The usage of Piazza as an online discussion forum was essential to success in this course, as the professor and students were highly responsive and very helpful. The weakness of this course is that it relies on prior knowledge of basic statistical concepts (e.g. chi-square testing): for problem sets, a priority is placed on understanding the code but on exams the statistical analysis is more relevant, leading to a disconnect.

Also, the psets were terrific in reinforcing what we had learned in lecture! \r\nWeaknesses: section times were hard to make at times; I wish there were more times for section to reinforce learning, even though we did have Piazza.

In lecture, I would miss a line and there would be no way to catch up, and none of my code would work for the rest of the class.  On the homework I would just copy the code from class and didn't really learn anything. ",

Be prepared to go to office hours or ask your CS friends for help with the homework if you don't have a background in coding. Take it credit/D if you can, it would have absolutely obliterated my GPA if I hadn't made that wise decision. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to understand data. It gives you a really good introduction into R programming. I had a lot of previous programming experience, so learning a new language wasn't that hard, but I don't know how easy the class was for people with no previous programming experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is a must take. In our current world of data, being able to analyze data is crucial. This course does just that. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. If you haven't taken any stats at all, take S&DS220 instead, but if you have you should take this class. You get to learn R by going through interesting datasets. The course is well organised and materials clearly builds on itself, so you don't find yourself all of a sudden wondering how we randomly got from one place to the next. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Learning R is incredibly important in today's age. Not only that, but you get to work with interesting data sets and learn the precise wording for deciphering and interpreting the conclusions from those data sets. The excellent teaching staff makes it easy to follow along, and it's clear the ULAs and professor want students to succeed. ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to someone with some prior coding experience. The statisitic aspects of the class aren't to bad but you need a certain type of mind to work through code. There are many times where I knew what to do but my syntax was off slightly or I didn't know exactly how to construct an argument. Admittedly, these issues are part of the class and help us grow, but if you dont have any coding experience whatsoever the whole process can leave you frustrated. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student who has any interest at all in computational statistics. Learning R through this course was made interesting by the cool data sets that we worked with, and it was taught in a way that balanced the computer science aspect and the statistics aspect well. The problem sets can sometimes be long, but in my opinion they were rewarding to work through and were the main way that I was able to solidify the ideas we discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to others if they have an option between it and another. It is better than other similar courses, but it is hard and a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone looking to dip their toe into coding, R is a fantastic way to start. Definitely take this class before you have to do econometrics if you are an econ major! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for any student who wants to build on their previous statistical knowledge. I came into this course having already taken AP Statistics, GLBL 121, and GLBL 191, and I thought it built on my previous knowledge without being too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the workload was manageable: 10 psets (1 per week), midterm, participation on piazza, and a final. Prof Wang was available on Piazza to answer questions, which she usually did with speed and clarity. \r\n\r\nPros: you do learn R pretty well if you put in the efforts on the problem sets. I actually really enjoyed figuring out the steps needed to answer a problem and what might be the best code for it. You cover the basics and quickly get into for-loops, if statements, bootstrapping, regressions, and eventually packages like ggplot and dplyr. The lectures are relatively clear--basically Prof Wang posts a skeleton of the lecture online as an R file which you download and during class you fill it in together. The raw and finished R files are all on Canvas. \r\n\r\nCons: because this class is about both data and analysis, assessing skills is difficult and the exams were not very fair (ex. the first exam you had to hand-write code chunks and got points docked for small things like dropping a comma, not capitalizing a letter, etc - things that if you ran your code you would discover and easily fix). The final ended up evaluating more of our understanding of stats and had little to do with the coding. Grading for the problem sets varies quite a bit depending on the grader. Class could have been a lot more interactive beyond simply copying down code - would have loved to delve more into the underpinnings/logic behind certain statistical concepts, which Prof Wang usually glossed over or summarized in one sentence. She will say you barely need stats or coding background to take the class; I had pretty solid background in both and still found it hard to \"do well\" in the class grade-wise despite being really enthusiastic about the material and doing well on the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants a better understanding of data analysis and how to code in R.

            "\u00a0Yes - very useful course and very useful skills learned for career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great stats class that will teach you a decent amount and is not too much work. You will walk away from this class much more comfortable coding in R, and will learn a lot beyond what your intro stats course teaches. Although the course does not go too much into theoretical statistics you will be exposed to several useful techniques and taking this class will set you up well for later stats courses. ",

Because of some of my problems with the instruction, I had to do a lot of self-teaching-- which was easier in th first half of the course. The course really isn't designed for those without programming experience, and you'll have a pretty steep learning curve the first couple weeks. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major. I feel that S&DS230 provides meaningful tools for examining data sets that concern our daily lives, and, at the most basic level, teaches an analytical approach to data science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for learning R! It was super useful. ",
            "\u00a0Don't be enthralled by Professor Susan Wang's voice.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wang is an amazing lecturer. She seems like she has a lot of experience in orating or at least public speaking. The first half of the semester goes really smoothly because of it, but the latter half... not so much\r\n\r\nThe class goes pretty slow in the beginning, and it seems like the class is going to be a gut, but the second half accelerates a lot and is a lot more conceptual and relies on a large statistics background. Albeit, you need to take intro stats before this, but even if you did, there's still a lot of material assumed by the professor, too much in my opinion. The problem with the class is that the easy material is reviewed over and over again in class, but the difficult conceptual material is not covered at all. All the difficult material is left for at home! This becomes really frustrating since you end up having to cover the last 20 minutes of class again after class since the material becomes so much more difficult that the first hour and 10 mins. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a great intro to the R programming language that wasn't too fast paced and more programming language focused. Susan is does a great job of clearly answering questions and explaining the concepts for this class. She posts her notes online after class, which is really helpful for reviewing and doing the homework. As for the homework problems, I really enjoyed doing them, and they helped a lot in bettering my understanding. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. It requires hard work at first because you have to completely learn R, but once you get that you can quickly do the interesting statistical analysis taught by the course. Additionally, the professor is very good at teaching so I not only recommend this course, but recommend taking it with Susan Wang. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great first class if you took AP Stats in high school. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is interested in being S&DS, then I think this class is critical for them. For others, it's still quite helpful to take as well. ",
