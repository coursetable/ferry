            "\u00a0This course provided an avenue to practice coding in Matlab as it relates to several examples of dynamic systems in biology. Although the specific biological topics covered were not related to my area of research interest, I am certainly more competent working in matlab and understanding computational research papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton. I hadn't the strongest math background and this class was an involved but not overly intensive way to learn to pick those skills up and flex them now and again. I think I most appreciate the ability to garner intuition about mathematical models without knowing all the details. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches mathematical and computational tools needed to model the dynamical properties of a broad range of biological systems. \r\nWe modeled different biological systems (neurons actions potential and cell chemotaxis) using ordinary differential equations.\r\nWe used Matlab to analyze and learn the models. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a quantitative and mathematical perspective of biological processes. I learned the mechanisms behind some simple but important systems and gained a basic idea on how they are simulated with mathematics, and how such simulation could improve our understanding of the complex biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basics of dynamical modeling in biological systems and several classic models for neuron dynamics, like the Hodgkin and Huxley Model, and for chemotaxis in bacteria. It focused on using MATLAB to model series of differential equations and numerically solve them to render system behavior. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned a great deal about dynamical systems in biology. Overall, it felt very similar to an advanced math course with applications to topics in biology (like neuroscience and stochasticity in biological systems). However, the class always felt well-organized with an orderly progression from basic math techniques and coding to more advanced application to biological systems. Further, I learned a lot about MATLAB coding and linear algebra (and how I could apply these concepts to biology). ",
            "\u00a0It is amazing to understand the biological process from a physical view. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some avenues of dynamical systems in biological systems. This also helped my understanding of differential equations and Matlab coding. ",

            "\u00a0As a beginner programmer, I enjoyed the \"hackathon\" lectures where the class is given a crash course in how to work with the relevant model(s) of the given section. I think the course would be much more effective in teaching these concepts if more of the lectures were structured like these hands on learning labs. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was organized very well and logically. It wasn't too much work, nor too little. But I would have appreciated a list of 'skills' or 'background' that you needed early on. ",
            "\u00a0This course brings together, and unites many areas: biological systems, mathematical modeling, physics and programming. ",
            "\u00a0The course involves derivation and understanding of a lot of mathematical equations, which seemed a little overwhelming, but the instructors explained them in a clear and detailed way. Also, the simple exercise questions each week were not difficult, but they could facilitate understanding of the course materials. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to learn higher levels of programming needed for biological systems. It's strengths are that the class catered well to both graduate and undergraduate students because it had several large projects inter-spaced with near weekly short exercises to reinforce the material. A weakness are the hackathons. These are a great feature of the class, but they were not carried out in a manner conductive to actually learning the code. The hws were not graded in a very timely manner as well. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is its orderly progression of material. The course built upon its own material from the start, so the weekly exercises and problem sets always helped us apply our knowledge in a practical setting. Further, the final project was very interesting in how we could apply our knowledge to real-life scientific studies. Also, the Hackathons were especially useful in applying our knowledge to real coding. ",
            "\u00a0It is excellent, nothing should be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it was engaging and interesting, the research topics covered were fascinating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class required an understanding of math that many of us did not have, and while the assignments were doable and the instructors provided some means to catch up, it made following the class more labor intensive than others. I will say that I am not sure of how this could be fixed and may just be a fact about studying dynamical systems in biology. ",
            "\u00a0lab plus lecture was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Damon Clark is an excellent and a dedicated instructor\r\nWeaknesses: the course was very broad and directed towards students from numerous backgrounds. Probably at any point of time, lectures were quite detailed or incomprehensible for a group of students. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I found it was very helpful to develop the computational skills I was interested in learning going into the course ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if I was sure they either had the requisite background or relevant interest--I think one of two of those is enough. ",
            "\u00a0This course is recommended for any student who would like to model biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to students who are interested in relevant research fields. They are explained in a very detailed and comprehensive way, and the instructors would lead the students to implement and explore the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student interested in dynamical systems in biology. It can be quite challenging without a strong math background however. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The introductory Dynamical systems course can be very useful in learning the basics of the material, but the class is well-organized from the beginning to make sure all the students were on the same page. The class is composed of various majors/backgrounds, so discussion is often really interesting. Further, working together on group presentations was always fun, because we could draw upon each of our skill sets. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, this course is very helpful for people who are interested in quantitative biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course, through this course, I learned how to use quantitative models to study biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they are interested in modeling systems. For other computationally minded individuals, it may not be the most relevant. However, this course would be a fantastic audit ",
            "\u00a0No - please see comments above. Course should be more focused and directed towards a specialized group of students - rather than an amalgam of students from numerous departments. "
