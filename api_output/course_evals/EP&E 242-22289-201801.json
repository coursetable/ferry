            "\u00a0Developed an ability to see a real interplay between political forces and economic interests through an often historical lens. Professor Swenson places lots of emphasis on historical context and our discussions often dealt with tracing historic narratives and finding key and enduring themes. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides the chance to take concepts from microeconomics into a discussion of recent developments within American politics and markets. It's incredibly gratifying to see these microeconomic tools come to life outside of the ceteris paribus world of the textbook. The course also features some cursory 19th/20th century American history. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about the political economy of various industries and a lot about political economy in general. The readings are not exhilarating, but if you do them, you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about how concepts in microeconomics could be applied to political dynamics. The areas we covered were broad, ranging from healthcare to environmental reform. Much of our discussions related to theories on regulation (including deadweight loss, asymmetric information issues, and the like). ",
            "\u00a0I learned to inquire about the different players behind the enactment or repeal of any regulation. We also covered the political foundations of the groundings of the economy, including banks, corporations, and property. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of the role of money and conflicts of interest in politics, and how politics and markets intersect in many of the important political issues of our age. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strength is certainly the diversity of reading material. I felt I would be reading different mediums each week and evaluating events from a series  of different vantage points. Weakness would be a tendency for seminar discussions to NOT be anchored in critical analysis of those readings. Felt discussions could have been led with more directionality and intention, and more explicitly linked to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides the chance to take concepts from microeconomics into a discussion of recent developments within American politics and markets. It's incredibly gratifying to see these microeconomic tools come to life outside of the ceteris paribus world of the textbook. The course also features some cursory 19th/20th century American history. The biggest strength of this course is definitely the syllabus. If you expect to actually take the time to read at least 75% of the readings (100-200 pages per week), you will get a lot out of the course. The readings cover at least 10 unique topics, and so there's a real chance that you'll come out of the class having learned 10 original concepts and ideas. That's not something that can be said for all class. If you only read a small part of the readings, however, I suspect that you'll come out disappointed, since class discussion moves to a new topic each week, so the knowledge on any given topic doesn't really get to accumulate if you don't do the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength and weakness are the same; the course is very very broad. You cover a lot of area, which is great if you have no familiarity with the areas, but it seemed like sometimes students with more background in the material didn't get much out of that week's readings. This course could be improved with more organization and a finalized syllabus that did not change each week. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a strength of the course was how many different areas the syllabus covered. We engaged with a few areas of economic theory pretty regularly throughout the semester, and I found myself applying them to each new unit which was especially helpful for my own understanding. I don't see any weaknesses to the course. ",
            "\u00a0It was very US specific at times. ",
            "\u00a0Although sometimes a bit lengthy, the course reading materials were superb. Class discussion was great as the students were given free rein to speak and ask questions, and Professor Swenson was great at steering the conversation in the right direction to ensure we did not stray off topic. The class could be improved by offering some guiding questions before class to make discussion even better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great survey/summary of many issues, interesting readings, helpful commentary on papers\r\nWeaknesses- we covered so many areas that I dont feel Ive developed a strong understanding of any one "

            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend to a student seeking to develop interdisciplinary skills in politics and markets. However, would caution students without microeconomic background from signing up simply because discussions could become quite technical with economic lexicon and phenomena. ",

",
            "\u00a0Sure, take this course if you want an overview of how and why regulation is created, or if you're interested in corruption. You get a few general theories of regulation, deregulation, and capture, and then you get a bunch of case studies/examples from the major industries in America. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. I'll say that I was an EPE major looking to fulfill the political systems requirement, and didn't have nearly as much background in some of the areas as other students. I would say don't be afraid to take this course as Professor Swenson provides great feedback, and if you meet with him to say you're struggling, he will keep an eye out for you in class. The readings can be dense and you might not get as much out of them as others, but I thought it was valuable nonetheless. You don't have to do every reading to do well, and the grading is fair. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is really interested in going into politics and/or economics. This course made me a bit disillusioned with politics, though, so Id caution any other idealists! "
