            "\u00a0This is the first class I have taken that has rewired the way I think about both international politics and domestic U.S. politics. I learned about politics as ideologies, and I learned about fascism and its effects around the world. Most importantly, this class challenged my perception of democracy, especially that of the U.S. Dr. Young's class has been the most relevant class I've taken so far at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. I was able to study historical movements more in depth than in any other class and was able to discuss these with a unique lens pertaining to contemporary issues. ",
            "\u00a0I fell in love with the way of thinking presented within Global Affairs - and potentially found my major through the intellectual prowess of this course. "

            "\u00a0This is such a wonderful course. It's certainly the most creatively designed class I've ever taken; the diversity of the syllabus topics makes it quite a different intellectual experience than my other courses (as a History major). It was also completely new to me to have experts come speak on their topics, and those were also amazing and inspiring experiences. The readings were all so well chosen. They were always very colorful, fun to read, and distinctive perspectives on that day's topics. Prof. Young didn't assign anything just because it seemed like the conventional wisdom on a subject for some background -- I always felt like she very carefully crafted the reading load to provide newer and sometimes controversial research in a field. They were often spicy, such as the Ignatieff and visual culture readings. Including the unit on Ethiopia was a great look at fascism's impact on the colonial world that I think was very important to include. It's fun to have a lot of freedom for the essay topics.\r\n\r\nIn terms of recommendations: I think I would try to conclude each session with a kind of \"bring it back\" conversation, to relate it to earlier weeks. I don't think each week felt disparate despite how radically different the class topics were, but at least for me this kind of reiterating connection helps to synthesize material. This would be especially useful for weeks with guest speakers.\r\n\r\n I would also include some philosophers (eg. Arendt and Horkheimer) who wrote about the experiences living under totalitarianism. I think Arendt's \"Total Domination\" chapter should be included along with the visual culture unit, because it is also about fascist impulse to expand state power into all spheres of private and cultural life. There's something about fascist efforts to force those living under it through specific emotional experiences (eg. the unequivocal labelling of \"degenerate\" art that guides viewers to despise it) that Arendt could offer greater insight into. I'd also recommend including readings about race encounters and fascism from the second book of Origins of Totalitarianism in the unit on Ethiopia. We talked about the realization of fascist impulses in the colonized world, and I think part of that conversation should also be about inception of proto-fascist ideas in the colonized world. I wonder if it would be possible to invite Prof. Snyder to talk about some of these topics.\r\n\r\nI would think about taking out the Holocaust commemoration week, because I didn't think it quite as clearly related to the course trajectory as other weeks' topics. I think in the Iraq week it would be good to add some readings focusing on a comment Chalabi made in the meeting: that it was hard for the Americans to understand how \"brutalized\" the Iraqis were in the fallout of the Sadam Hussein regime. I would have liked to have something focusing on the psychological impact on the Iraqi society. I think this could relate very well to discussions on a fascist government's enforced visual culture, the specific role it forces its citizens to play in the society, and how it uses shocking violence to reach these ends. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Young does a great job of fostering a comfortable environment. She steers conversation naturally and seems very interested in the insights that her students have to offer. Dr. Young also asks difficult, pervasive questions that really forces her students to think critically about democracy, fascism, and their relationship. One of the best parts of the course is that Dr. Young connects everything back to current events and contemporary politics. Every seminar begins with a discussion of recent happenings and what they mean for democracy in America. The readings are reasonable and broad in scope, and the writing assignments are as well. \r\n\r\nThe most compelling part of this course is Dr. Young's genuine connection to the material and to her students. It makes for a great class.\r\n\r\nA weakness would be that at times, there seems to be a lack of structure, and so the takeaways can be vague or inconclusive. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this class was very well crafted. Everything flowed well together from studying historical movements to modern issues. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the overall syllabus, the material, the readings presented, the way of thinking encouraged. The instructor's knowledge and wisdom was also of great help. No clear weaknesses with the exception of perhaps some bias regarding some issues. "
