            "\u00a0This class helped me learn about the history of Russian and it's impact on art. Through the various excursions I gained a deeper respect for the city of St Petersburg and the historical and literary figures that shaped it. I learned about the distinct writing styles of different authors and how they lived. ",
            "\u00a0A solid insight into the transformations in Russian art and literature from Pushkin to present. ",
            "\u00a0broad history and analysis of russian literature starting at pushkin ",
            "\u00a0You learn the basic trends in Russian literature by reading the defining authors starting from Pushkin ending with Pelevin. ",
            "\u00a0Deep insight into Russian literature and cultural history. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of knowledge of russian literature ",
            "\u00a0Survey of trends in Russian literature and history ",
            "\u00a0Furthering my knowledge and understanding of Russian literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introductory survey of Russian literature and culture. It covered the works of the most influential and famous Russian authors and artist throughout history. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class allowed for engaging discussion, however the readings were sometimes too long for the time allotted. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, too much time is spent trying to analyse the really nonsensical futurist, constructivist, and suprematist literature and art. ",
            "\u00a0seemed to slow down after dostoevsky, but really great readings the entire time ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, but there were too many trips to churches.  Also, many of the museums would have been more interesting with no tour guide. ",
            "\u00a0The course is introductory and does a good job showing how the idea of transformation runs throughout Russian literature. Professor Firtich does a good job running class and guiding you through the works. ",
            "\u00a0Great literature and lectures, though a little slow at points in Russia. Amazing excursions ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, interesting content, not enough time ",
            "\u00a0Too much content.  If I had not read most of the material prior to the course then I would have been unable to complete all the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The selected readings were always very interesting and engaging, as well as the analysis in class afterwards. I would suggest covering the Russian history surrounding these works in class more often, not only to bolster our knowledge of Russian history, but also to give us a bit more context regarding each work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for anyone that wants to truly experience the vast and beautiful Russian history. It was a truly life-changing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Firtich is a really fun and interesting professor. The readings are generally pretty interesting, even the background ones, and definitely worth doing. The class is only really good when people have done the readings and are engaged, which definitely suffered once we were in St. Petersburg and people began to fall behind on readings, but overall it was a good course and a really good introduction to Russian literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Its an intriguing course. ",
            "\u00a0yeah ",
            "\u00a0Yes,  a great course run by a great professor. Must take if you want to understand Russian lit. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Firtich was great ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student and what they are trying to gain from the experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Summer in Russia was an amazing experience, and it's wonderful to be introduced to Russia's rich culture, not only as a means of appreciating the country itself, but also developing a stronger passion for the language. "
