            "\u00a0I developed critical thinking skills that were mastered through class discussions and reading texts every week. The insights I formed during my time in this class contributed to my worldview about utopias and dystopias in the context of current events and trends. ",
            "\u00a0I read historical texts that I would not have otherwise. I learned how to better creatively write toward the end. ",
            "\u00a0Reading analytically and thinkinking critically. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I developed the skills of critical thinking, debate, logic, and philosophical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking, writing, philosophy, contextualization. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course made me look at political thought as a whole quite differently, as I have begun to look at all world decisions in the lens of utopian thought. I think I definitely have a better understanding not only of how utopias are viewed and created, but also how all societies are built in the vision of a utopia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the most influential utopias in Western civilization and how they are often a product of the problems of the time period. I also learned about a few influential 20th century dystopias. "

            "\u00a0The clear strength of the course is Professor Jordan and how passionate she is about her work and the topic of the class. The supplementary texts also provide an interesting and diverse array of opinions that inform the class discussions, all of which are robust and stimulating. One of the few weaknesses I saw were that the long presentations students had to give weekly were taking away from class discussion time and moved the class along very slowly. ",
            "\u00a0Toward the end the focus was not entirely clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings are really interesting and diverse. The in-class discussions are very well thought out and the professor always directs the discussions well.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the reading material is too much to discuss all in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that the material was engaging and interesting. Weaknesses were that some of the readings at the end were slightly less interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Wide diversity of texts.\r\nSome texts too obscure ",
            "\u00a0The primary weakness of this course is that many of the readings became a bit repetitive at a certain point in the course. As well, I felt that discussions and debates didn't necessarily help me learn anything new a lot of the time. I think this course would be aided if we were to look at utopias not necessarily focused in the west so we could gain a greater view of the way utopias are satisfied throughout the world. Overall, though, I really did enjoy the course. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The discussions and readings really are the bread and butter. Moreover, Professor Jordan conducts the class in such a manner where everyone is involved and feels a personal connection to the material at hand. Her kindness and understanding allowed our class to become really close together and made for better debates and group work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in creating their own utopian societies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Jordan is the best professor that you could ask for, especially in your first semester in college. Shes really kind and caring to her students, and her enthusiasm will inspire you a lot. ",

            "\u00a0Yes the texts and topics are interesting to discuss ",
            "\u00a0I really did like it, so I would probably recommend it. I thought it was really interesting, even if it did get a bit repetitive. I learned a lot and I still think about some of the stuff we learned in class. My knowledge of history, politics, and philosophy have been strengthened by this class, and I also ended up reading some pretty good literature. Overall, this class was very stimulating and I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course has very interesting content and a knowledgeable professor. "
