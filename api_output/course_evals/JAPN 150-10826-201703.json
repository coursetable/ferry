            "\u00a0The class is taught very well. Possibly an interim grade report could have been given, but all assignments and tests were promptly graded and given back, so this isn't much of an issue! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - personal feedback, close-knit class, kind/helpful professors\r\nWeakness - perhaps not enough time devoted to conversation skills; professor sometimes let one student dominate class discussion, not giving others time to think ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved getting to read Japanese authors and pieces of literature. Stever Sensei is an incredible teacher. She knows how to explain things clearly, is organized, and can run a class very well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although I didn't mind this as much, I did hear a lot of people complaining that the course was so heavily focused on readings/reading discussions. I also found that the system of learning kanji was not particularly effective, as much of the daily kanji lists were forgotten quickly. In particular, I also found the worksheet with kanji radicals not particularly helpful. I would love a bit more repetition of kanji. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professors. I would have liked more larger assignments maybe, and maybe more conversation, but I really enjoyed the readings and the  discussions we did have in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to learn Japanese, the teachers are awesome! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend the class. This semester, we were taught by Stever and Saito Sensei. I think Stever Sensei is one of the best teachers in the department, and she really knows how to explain grammar structures clearly.\r\n\r\nThe class is very heavily focused on reading/discussions of reading however. If you are not someone who likes to slowly work through literature, this probably isn't for you. I personally found it exciting to be able to read pieces that are completely unavailable in English, but it can be tedious sometimes. There are many nuances in readings that are hard to get a hand on, so the learning can feel slow. In addition, the rate at which you are learning things that feel really \"new\" goes down a lot. In L1/L2, the class is based on fast-paced learning of grammar structures and is very exciting, but L5 is much more toned down. (You won't do things like act out/practice grammar structures) \r\n\r\nA great class if you are interested in literature though. I found all the kanji hard to absorb (daily quizzes), but if you are willing to dedicate yourself, I believe you can learn a lot. ",
