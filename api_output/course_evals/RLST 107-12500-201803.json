            "\u00a0I learned that the work of philosophy is a work of collaborative interpretation. I also learned by the teaching method of Professor Levene to be patient with the text and to return to it over and over again for insight. There was a certain methodological wisdom to the course that can extrapolated for use in everyday life. Precisely, all of life is patient interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives an opportunity to read difficult and important material and authors, but not simply learn how to speak \"like them\" but rather learn how to read them through their (the students') own voices (which may include both praise and criticisms). The questions pursued throughout the course included: what does it mean to live? what does it mean to exist? what is truly real? is our experience simply an imperfect perception of reality? ",
            "\u00a0I walked away from this class more confident in my skills as a writer and thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophical thinking, exegesis. ",

            "\u00a0The syllabus was excellent. I gained a broad, but in depth, knowledge of our readers and their place in western philosophy. However, class time felt almost completely unproductive, and I say this with no offense intended. From day one, it was never made clear as to what exactly we were after, so to speak. There was no structure. I understand the intent of offering interpretive freedom; but I am not at Yale to interpret completely freely. I am here (indeed, paying) to learn from experts who will guide us through rigorous material. That is all I would have wished, more guidance. I am an avid reader, thus I was able to make the class productive. But the flexibility does not lend itself to productivity. As a side note, office hours with Professor Levene were really positive and productive. Her vast knowledge of the material is evident and her kindness and genuine interest in her students is great. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely engaging and yet very accommodating. Though I am not a philosophy major (I came into the class thinking I would take it simply for the DR), I found that the material was still very manageable and was able to still make some contributions to discussions (amidst a class of philosophy majors and even a few graduate students). The class requires engagement in the reading, but does not require that you understand them -- the class discussion is largely focused on working through the difficult aspects of the reading. However, Professor Levene is insistent on not simply providing \"answers\" or her interpretation -- she has a strong emphasis on students finding their own reading of these thinkers, which I found was much more fulfilling/interesting than simply learning the summaries of each of the thinkers. \r\nHowever, I think my sole suggestion for improvement for this course would be to occasionally go back to the big picture of how the perspectives of these thinkers influence/change/reflect my philosophy -- this may be more of the job of students to do outside of the class, but I thought it may have been beneficial to bring up that question a couple of times during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I love that this course involves reading both classic philosophy texts and other types of texts like Hamlet and poetry. Philosophy courses are challenging so it's nice to get a little bit of a break with material that's easier to read but still relevant to the course. The alternative material is also helpful for understanding the challenging ideas in the philosophy. I also love that Professor Levene was flexible about the syllabus and let us stay longer on a text that was challenging to us. The only weakness I can think of is that at times I thought it might've been helpful to have a little more guidance/structure in class discussion. I also think class participation should be factored into the grade. ",
            "\u00a0Within this course there are a lot of high level readings and this can work to the advantage of students who are extremely familiar with philosophical concepts. However, for students who are completely new to philosophy it will be a very steep learning curve as they will have to adapt and learn everything as the course progresses. This course does not function as an introduction philosophy course in any way, there are no formal lessons and all class time is discussions between the class. Students are expected to learn everything on their own time. ",
            "\u00a0Dont make the final paper worth 60% and be able to share your opinion sometimes instead of just sticking to the exact words off the page. "

            "\u00a0My answer to this question can be gleaned from my answer to question 3 above. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student -- it is not a gut by any means, but if you are looking for a potential introduction or entryway course to philosophy, this is an absolutely incredible candidate. The readings are dense but not long, and the class discussions are extremely rich. I would especially recommend this course for non-philosophy students -- it does not assume any prior knowledge, and in some sense, I found that it was easier for me to develop my own reading of these thinkers having not taken any philosophy courses in the past. If you are not a philosophy major, this is an incredible opportunity to learn and really engage with an interesting and important topic that you may never get the opportunity to pursue after Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I preferred it to many of the other philosophy courses I've taken because we got to read Hamlet and some poetry in addition to the more challenging philosophical texts. The application of philosophy to those texts was very interesting and illuminating. Professor Levene is also obviously passionate about the material. She draws a lot of diagrams on the board, so if you're a visual learner, that might be especially helpful to you. One thing I would definitely recommend is coming to class each week with a potential starting point for discussion in mind. Professor Levene usually asked students to jumpstart the discussion rather than choosing a starting point for us. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend taking this class or another one like it with Professor Levene enough. It empowers students to think for themselves and truly understand difficult philosophical concepts all while improving your writing skills in an accessible way. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. Professor Levene makes the course totally accessible for non-philosophy majors without making it uninteresting for philosophy majors. Grading is tough (but totally fair), class discussion is good (though you should come to class with plenty to say), and office hours are fantastic (use them). Reading load is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0No, I didnt learn anything and felt like the class had zero organization at all. It was a seminar where there was zero participantion grade so what is the point of showing up. The entire class was just reading and we never got to share anything we thought on our own. You could just read it at home and would learn exactly as much. She also refused to answer questions about what she wanted to see on our papers. "
