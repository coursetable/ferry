            "\u00a0I believe the instructor was phenomenal. She was extremely helpful with the information and was willing to make sure students understood the material. In terms of improvement, I would have preferred more standard answer sheets handed out for the problems set but I appreciate corrections to problems sets where handed back within a timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0Good baseline understanding of statistics required for medical and public health research.\r\nExtremely clear, concise, very well layed out lectures\r\nLecturer and lab tutor both extremely good at explaining concepts\r\nVery fast marking\r\nSuggested improvements - make lectures slightly more interactive/less boring, don't have the 5% grade for participation in in class exercises as it doesn't seemed to be formally assessed, have a break in the middle of all two hours lectures ",
            "\u00a0This course helped fortify the existing knowledge I had about biostatistics. The pleasant and approachable nature of both Dr. Maria and Dr. Victoria who were patient beyond description is beyond description. I have not had such wonderful teachers in a long time. There was no question to which Dr. Maria did not know the answer- and if there was something that needed further discussion, both teachers came back to us with extra information. Dr. Maria even conducted extra classes on Logistic regression which were probably not part of the course syllabus. I applaud the teachers of this class and would recommend it to anyone who would want to take it. The only negative I could find is the lack of availability of the textbooks in the library and the textbooks being kept as course reserve only and not part of the general borrowing section of the library - as a new student without resources, this really hampered my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor. Maria explains really well and slides are very instructive. Although the workload is high, the different labs and problem sets are really helpful to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Very satisfied with course.  The instructor has a wonderful ability to break the course down to a very basic level (assuming students have no prior knowledge of the material) and build from the ground level up. ",
            "\u00a0The lab session was great because I felt like I learned both theoretical and practical contents of basic statistics. ",
            "\u00a0The course was honestly really useful and helpful, particularly given the difficult material. Maria was a fantastic instructor. My one suggestion would be to improve the pacing of the class as a whole. I thought we spent too much time on lessons such as probability while we had to rush through more difficult concepts like hypothesis testing. As a result, the first few weeks of the class were slow while the last few weeks were rushed and often hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was great. Very well organized. Clear expectations and goals. Very well designed and implemented. ",
            "\u00a0My only comment will be on the amount of problem sets we had to do. It was a little too much compared to the time we had. ",
            "\u00a0strengths were the detailed slides and SAS videos ",
            "\u00a0Very good course ",
            "\u00a0lots of material, wouldve enjoyed taking this class at a slower pace with some more real world context ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely enjoyed the class, Lectures were well designed, homework was graded timely, and the instructor had also been very helpful. The only thing I felt that it could be improved was the lab sessions. The goal of this class was to make sure students would be comfortable using SAS (the software we used in this class). However, after the summer session, I still experience difficulty operating statistical analysis on SAS. I wish there would have been more SAS practice in lab. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course, probably the best I've done in my 13 years of university. Maria was wonderful and was really passionate about the material. Victoria was incredibly knowledgeable and made the computer component interesting. Both facilitated an environment conducive to learning and for us students to develop a passion for the content ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were very long and somewhat tedious. While I understand this is an accelerated course and a lot needs to be packed into a short period of time, I thought many of the questions on the problem sets were similar and therefore the problem sets could have been cut down. For the minimal amount that all of the homeworks contributed to our grade, we spent an extraordinary amount of time on them. \r\n\r\nAlso, I found the course material easiest to grasp when tied to examples of health issues, and I wish this could have been done more often throughout the course. Given that we are all interested in working in the health space, being able to understand the relevance of biostatistics to our future work is critical, and I didn't feel like I could always grasp that. The \"real\" examples used in lectures were the most interesting and helpful part of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: maria is friendly and approachable \r\nweaknesses: biostatistics is a difficult subject to teach, especially to a group of people with a mixed background in stats. However, more effort should be made to clarify students understanding as the term progressed. Only towards the final lessons, were road maps of the term and our learning objectives made clear and would have been helpful to have had a reminder 5 minutes at the start of each lesson. \r\nhomework: long and laborious with lots of repetition. Took so many hours. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nExcellent teaching skills, excellent presentation skills and involvement of the class in the lecture- make a boring subject like Biostatistics thoroughly interesting and listenable. Excellent slides, excellent material and excellent out of class communication through emails and announcements. Every aspect of the class ran like clockwork. Extremely accommodative of student requests and kindness galore. She would work even after hours clearing doubts. \r\nWeakness: Making eye contact-not enough\r\nText books- keeping more of the text book in the public health library or the bio-statistics library for poorer students to use.

I think one or two 5 minute breaks would be helpful to regain focus. Otherwise, Maria is awesome.\r\nVictoria too is great. She made very meaningful comments on the homework that helped me focus on the areas I was weak in. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely fantastic. It's a dense subject but Maria made it interesting and her welcoming attitude made coming to class fun. Easily one of the best instructors I've ever seen. ",
            "\u00a0Maria was a very passionate and articulate teacher, however, for many of us the material is not the most exciting, or the easiest to grasp. I think it would have been helpful if we were always more closely tying the formulas and models to real world examples. I also think it would have been helpful if the class was a bit more interactive. At the beginning of the summer, we had worksheets we would work on at different points throughout class and then Maria would lead us through them, which was helpful. However, by the end of the course we were going through the worksheet as a class from the beginning, which didn't give us the space or time to process the information individually. Also, I appreciate how willing Maria was to help us, but because we were moving through the material so quickly, it became difficult to ask more basic questions. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Ciarleglio is a great instructor , she is very helpful and welcoming to all questions. ",
            "\u00a0Maria is lovely. She could bear in mind more that some people have very little stat knowledge though and sometimes I found the classes very confusing and not engaged. However, I appreciated her effort, especially with her video lectures which I feel make a good adjunct to her lessons.She also could annotate her slides better, as she often left a lot of the slides blank to be completed in class, which was difficult unless you had a touch screen tablet or laptop.
