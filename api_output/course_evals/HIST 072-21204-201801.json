            "\u00a0You will learn how to read and write. This course will greatly decrease my workload of the rest of the courses I will take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me things that no one else at yale agrees with. \r\n1. Your paper is good if you busy your topic sentence in the middle so that it is hard to find. \r\n2.  Don't let your road map sentence be too clear, if you can tell your argument there is no reason to keep reading.\r\n3. Your conclusion can't contain anything that you've said before in your work, if it does then it's redundant and not worth reading. ",
            "\u00a0Most importantly, I refined my ability to write analytical history essays and speak analytically about topics. Beyond that, I learned about how historical process has developed and changed across different cultures and times. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hansen has radically changed my academic abilities for the better; overall, I feel more prepared for my Yale career to come because of this class. 1. Most importantly, she's improved my writing skills! Write clearly and concisely. Don't shy away from short sentences. Learning how to streamline and effectively present an argument in writing is probably one of the most important things you'll need to learn in college. Learn it early before it's too late - b/c of this class, I feel prepared for future academic writing endeavors. It also helped me a lot with my other WR credit this semester! 2. She taught me how to read effectively. You can't spend your life doing all 100 pages of the reading but you also can't give up. This class hones in your skill of choosing what's important to read for discussion. 3. She has improved my public speaking skills. All you need and should have is one point! I thought I had these skills already but this class definitely improved those as well. 4. As a seminar, this course prepared me to engage fully in discussion centered courses. I learned to really back up everything I say with evidence. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hansen taught me a lot about writing in a more straightforward manner and forming a strong argument in my papers. She really pushed me to write with my own voice, and it worked. I also learned more how to be a successful student at Yale in terms of how I should approach my assignments. As a STEM student, I'm used to working my way through psets and was intimidated by all the books we had to read in class. Professor Hansen took the time to go over how to strategically read through such thick books and how to best allocate our time when it comes to homework assignments. She also helped us learn a lot more about Yale and what each major is like so that we get a better sense of what we'd like to do in the future. She invited a lot of upperclassmen in to talk about the class with us. I also learned a lot about important historians and how they interpreted history in their writings. This course also taught me how difficult it is to run a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Historical causal analysis and how to write better papers. Learned how to navigate Yale academically (reading strategies and bluebook essay writing) and greatly improved my public speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about essential skills for how to survive in history classes here  one of the really cool aspects of the class is that Professor Hansen places an emphasis on teaching you reading, speaking, and writing skills, which is really helpful. I also did learn a lot about the historians we studied, and I feel like I understand enough about historical inquiry to get the different approaches and place historians in their respective traditions. ",
            "\u00a0HOW TO READ EFFICIENTLY, Professor Hansen teaches you how to get the main ideas of the book! Also, you learn about historiography and study impactful history writers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge in the differences in scope and method between major early world historians from different regions and time periods. I learned how to read older texts and to use them to glean information about the author's method, sourcing, and the society they lived in. I also gained skills in writing succinctly and in debating and oral presentations. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The teacher seemed to single me out specifically. She repeatedly requested that I not talk in class and made contradictory requests on my papers. Some notable quotes include. \"DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT A RUN ON SENTENCE IS?\" \"Don't tell me you haven't read all of the authors works.... pretend what you read was eveerything.\" Followed by on the next paper \"this isn't true... if you had just read the rest of the authors works you would have seen...\" I was told that I was not allowed to use outside resources after correcting the professor in the first few classes. And I was harshly lectured for referencing her as Mrs. Which where I am from is what every adult is called assuming they are a married female. She also guilted my friend into dropping her course by saying that it wasn't fair some people could take 2 freshman seminars and others never could. I will however say that all of these personal issues, there were more than those listed, did not seem to affect how she graded my work. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the feedback that Professor Hansen gives you. She can sometimes brutally rip apart your writing, but her criticism leaves you better off in the end. I also thought the readings were well chosen--a super manageable quantity and fairly interesting. \r\n\r\nOccasionally class time felt poorly used. We probably could have covered another historian or written another paper, but that is a small problem. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Turns you into a critical thinker, incisive writer, and less wishy-washy person overall. Helps level the playing field; prepares you for academic work in any/every field for upperclassmen years. It's better to learn and work on these skills as a first year! Has reasonable workload (5 progressively longer papers (longest 2000 words, reading books). Note: if you're not used to this, of course you will have a harder time getting used to this workload, but other writing courses demand a lot more. Also! I came into this class knowing I wanted to develop those skills, but I also came away with a deep sense of respect for historiography and the history department. In learning about how we write history and considering the range and credibility of past historians, you develop a way to critically think about the current narrative we shape.\r\nWeaknesses: uhhh none? Kinda wish we focused more on al-Tabari and less on Herodotus but overall this is an extremely well-structured course. Professor Hansen knows what she's doing and continues to reshape her course in response to student input. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that you read some of the most prominent historians in history. This course's readings cover historians from Ancient Greece to the early empires of China. Class time is spent discussing these historians and their ideas. This course also teaches you how to write strong, coherent papers with a clear argument. We also went to the MET and the Yale University Art Gallery. Weakness of this course is that sometimes there were no discussion questions and students were left to discuss on their own. As a result, it didn't seem like we got very far with the discussion and didn't come out of it with a clear grasp of what we read. I think there should always be some discussion questions, whether it's provided by the professor or by the students, to guide each class in order to make sure that we will get to the most important topics before class is over. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is its strong emphasis on improving your writing skills, which is great and worth taking for that reason alone. Professor Hansen is also a great discussion leader and always kept the discussion lively. The only weakness of the course is that it does not really emphasize the connections between texts we read throughout the term, so some of the texts felt like we read them in isolation. Though the debates emphasized comparative analysis between texts, I would appreciate a more perceptible flow between one text to another in the greater context of history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very instructive, little busy work, great feedback on papers, very interesting course material, to name a few\r\nWeaknesses - not really any major ones I can think of. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a lot of fun! (Oops, I used passive voice) Professor Hansen makes the class very engaging and has a lots of tips for how to read, write, speak and live your life at Yale. Many times, she brought in students from previous years to give us advice, from choosing a major to creating arguments for a debate.  Professor Hansen, however, did not give much feedback in our writing assignments. After the first round of feedback, it becomes your responsibility to improve your writing (except the final paper). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the different types of writing and presentations that we were required to do so that we got to practice a variety of skills. I also enjoyed the guest speakers from past years. A weakness of the course is I feel that we did not actually learn much concrete history and some of the class discussions were not as informative because of this. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. You get to practice a lot of things that you'll do again in other classes. Prof Hansen knows a lot about navigating Yale, and invites previous students back too. ",
            "\u00a0Hell no. I think that all my previous answers explain why. In the first class she said after 5 minutes you'd know if you like her. After 5 minutes it seemed she didn't like me and it lasted the whole course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student. Go to the first class period and see how you feel about Professor Hansen. I don't think that you will immediately know if you will like or hate her, but you will have a gut instinct on the class. I would follow your gut. She will brutally attack your writing, but it will leave you more prepared for the future. The workload is super manageable. This class probably has less writing than most writing credits, and you never have too much reading. Professor Hansen does a good job introducing you to Yale academics, and you get to do cool first-year seminar things (like she took us to the MET in NY). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Take this course!! With a few caveats. Don't take it if you're not prepared to get less than ideal grades and spicy commentary (although thankfully, it seems like grades are dependent on your improvement throughout the semester). Don't take it if you have 0 interest in world history/historiography. Don't take it if you're unprepared to back up your claims and get called out when you don't (sorry for all the double negatives whoops). DO take this if you're ready to truly learn, grow confident in your own academic abilities, and get to know an amazing professor! Professor Hansen has a particular way of teaching but both she and all of her students know how effective it can be. She is upfront in her comments but a very FAIR evaluator - in the end, her goal and wish is to help YOU.  Definitely a question of fit in terms of teaching style, but the only way you can tell is through shopping the class. Even then, don't base everything on face value; stick with the class and it might turn into your favorite one yet. Through this class I've gained invaluable learning experiences and and the guidance of a fantastic mentor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. You get so many new experiences from it. Not only do you have discussions about cool historians, you also get to go to museums to see the things you discuss about in person. This course is a great introduction to courses at Yale. It teaches you reading and writing strategies that most professors wouldn't sit down with you one on one to tell you. It also teaches you how to be a better public speaker since you do a lot of debates and presentations towards the end of the semester. This course also introduces you to the various resources that Yale has for checking out books. This was my most exciting class this semester because there's just so many different experiences packed into one class. Each class is different and you learn something new. You never do the same stuff over and over again. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I cannot imagine where my academic writing would be without this course. While not all the strategies we learned are easily applicable to other papers, most of them are. Professor Hansen legitimately cares about her students and truly wants to help us improve. Not all of the readings were interesting but the vast majority of them were. Overall, course material is engaging, you gain useful skills, and Professor Hansen is an interesting person. You cant go wrong with this class unless you hate writing, but even then this class is a very manageable writing credit that gives you SO many useful skills for prospering at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are planning on majoring in the humanities, I think this class does a GREAT job of preparing you for that. More than anything , it teaches you how to approach history, and that is an incredibly useful skill. Even if not (which I am not), the class is both interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you like history and have good writing skills (and an easier [NOTE: not easy] writing credit). The class is meant to improve your writing skills, but if you are not especially good at it already, it may seem difficult to improve. However, the two 4-page papers and final 8-page paper is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if the student is very interested in reading old historians and learning about the early development of historical method  rather than a more traditional overview of the facts of world history. It improves your writing and includes a fun trip to New York. "
