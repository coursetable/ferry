            "\u00a0My writing significantly improved over the 4 weeks. Having that isolated, dedicated time to work on craft alongside such talented students and such an invested professor made improvement really inevitable. The daily writing assignments pushed us to continue churning out work even when we felt squeezed dry of ideas, a skill necessary for anybody pursuing a career in writing. But above all the environment was so unique and conducive to an immersive creative experience. Wouldn't change anything about it. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my writing in the following ways:\r\n\r\nMore adept at structuring essays (specifically, essay conclusions)\r\nBetter at editing\r\nMore efficient at writing (ie: can churn out high quality work faster)\r\nImproved critical reading abilities\r\n\r\nI have a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. I also feel more confident in my abilities. I have a much greater appreciation for all of the work that goes into travel writing and other nonfiction pieces. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, none of these improvements felt like 'grunt work.' They happened seamlessly/gradually over the course of the month. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest skills I developed was finding my own voice in my writing. While we read and emulated more authors than I have ever read in such a short period of time, the key focus of the class was discovering what worked for me and the writing styles that flowed naturally to show my personality in my essays. I not only honed in on grammar rules, I also learned the leeway authors can have in the creative and travel writing genres. I truly learned to write under pressure and produce quality work under very strict time constraints; work that still held personal meaning and a connection to bigger ideas instead of solely focusing on my own experiences. I discovered for the first time that when writing about place, or any personal narrative, telling a specific story conveys a greater message than generalizing an idea. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed holistically as a writer. I learned to center my thoughts, build structure into my creative process and developed productive ways to edit others' work as well as productive ways to respond to criticism. I also developed my technical attention to writing. Together in class we'd analyze essays more deeply than I've experienced with other courses as well as more comfortably. I never felt that we were bullshitting through our two hours and found myself itching to get to work writing by the end of each of our discussions: eager to try my hand at the tools we'd just discovered how to use. I think examples are very important in learning how to write. Mimicking and then growing from that experience into your own voice is very important and I found our course material and discussion very very helpful in whittling down exemplar essays to their core of what makes them so powerful. Discovering what makes good writing good is oftentimes a mystery and I feel this course taught me reliable techniques for identifying the power of a piece so that the technique can be co-opted for my own work. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking about writing consciously. \r\nDescribing with originality and intent. \r\nMaking my writing do more than one job. \r\nConcluding with subtlety and nuance. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills developed immensely, and I learned how to edit and read with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0I have never written so much in my life, never received such clear and dedicated instruction and feedback on my writing, never grown so much as a person, a student, and a writer. This course requires stellar time management and internal motivation. Most importantly, I feel like I took away from this summer a clear direction of how I want to proceed with the rest of my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write on an extreme deadline, forcing me to do away with my perfectionism and embrace raw ideas and run with them. I became much more comfortable experimenting with my writing, as this course helped me see writing as a form of expression and a process of development rather than output for a grade. I also became a much better editor which has helped me look at my own writing through more constructive eyes. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know how I could possibly do justice to this course (Grand Canyon tactic?), but I'll try. The first is obvious: I learned how to write, and write fast, and write personal. It seems kind of silly to say that everyone who took this course grew dramatically as a writer (because how obvious is that?!) but I guess it merits mentioning. I learned so much about myselfabout how I perceive the world around me, about how I experience myself and the places in which I've existed. I'm really at a loss for words at this point because I know I'm not articulating how this course changes you, and because I feel like surely because of this course I should be able to, but it just shows how wildly changing it was. This is a class that will make you a better writer (by leaps and bounds), but it will also change how you perceive yourself and your relationships with others and your world at home. This is a good thing. ",
            "\u00a0We analyzed texts and discussed ways to integrate these techniques in our own writing. We also explored the politics of the travel writing genre and the responsibilities we have as both readers and writers. "

            "\u00a0The strengths were the nature of the syllabus (daily micro essays and weekly macro essays), Professor Kinder, the collaborative house environment, and the internet ban. I do think sometimes we didn't go into enough depth with the readings during seminar, but that's a result of the fast-paced nature of the course. I can't think of a way to talk in sufficient detail about two course credits worth of reading, and in general we kept good pace and touched on most things, but sometimes I was left feeling a bit dissatisfied about the extent to which we delved into a piece. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are: \r\n\r\nThe amazing instructor: Professor Kinder is brilliant and dedicated and inspirational.\r\n\r\nThe pace: The work was challenging, but did not feel overwhelming. The length of assignments and spacing between them was appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe balance of class time and work time: The amount of class time left plenty of time to complete the writing, but was enough time to discuss the material\r\n\r\nThe wide variety of writing opportunities: Every week there are many prompts to choose from. The prompts themselves are open ended as well. You can always find something you actually want to write about. No one is ever forced into writing about an undesirable/boring topic\r\n\r\nThe readings: The readings are interesting and engaging. It is an ideal amount of reading material. It is substantive but not overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe setting: Auvillar is incredibly beautiful and peaceful. It is a lovely setting to write in. Weekend trips were a wonderful change and provided more inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe size: The small class size is an ideal amount of people.\r\n\r\nI genuinely cannot think of ways to improve the course. Perhaps one less micro essay a week to allow more time for macro preparation. But I'm guessing that's not possible because of credit fulfillment. ",
            "\u00a0This course truly pushed my out of my comfort zone in my writing through every way possible. It pushed in terms of the amount of material I produced in a tight time period, it pushed me to express myself through experimental channels I wouldn't have tried otherwise and pushed me to read my work to strangers I would have otherwise never have shown my writing to. The course helped me feel much more comfortable sharing my work with others and I was inspired by other students' work in turn. The class sessions were extremely helpful and very clearly thought out, and the way class sessions and working sessions were interlaced worked extremely well. The schedule gave students enough scheduled time to dedicate to both the readings and the writing prompts. ",
            "\u00a0I'm honestly so pleased with my experience in this course I think picking out any weakness would just be nit-picking. All of it was incredible: the location, Prof. Kinder, Irina, the townspeople. I'd love for it to have been six weeks instead of four. I think longer would have solidified a sense of place, given opportunity for independent travel and allowed me to push myself through a few more longer pieces. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most amazing course experience I have ever had. It is very strong in terms of its engagement of students, and making students think consciously about writing. This is largely because it is located off campus and without internet. It is also very strong in peer evaluation and review of work, which is because of a community living arrangement in a new and wonderful place like Auvillar. Course readings are interesting and helpful. Perhaps the course could do with more focus on craft and less on writing ethics, which constantly plague writers and after a point, it may be better to concede that these ethical questions are beyond the scope of seminar time. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful for all of the writing it had us do, and for the way we were encouraged to support each others' writing.  I think that the professor could be a little bit more clear on the expectations for the content of what we were writing. ",
            "\u00a0It was very helpful having the course packet so far in advance. The curriculum and readings were well thought out, and the extracurricular time was well managed. ",
            "\u00a0This course give you a lot of freedom to experiment with your writing and an immense amount of support--both in the form of Professor Kinder as well as your peer writing tutors. It also introduces you to writing as a practical form, eroding the notion that writing is always for a grade. I think it would be helpful to keep seminars in the earlier part of the day (11am). ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, almost everything is a strength. This course is so lovingly and carefully crafted and organized; every piece just fits into place. The pace is fast but it's fast so that you don't get stuck and so that you get really good (and you produce A LOT). The readings are well selected and the level of engagement is so, so high (everyone buys in, completely) that class discussion is frequently an edge-of-your-seat type affair. The writing partner system is lovely, but by the middle of the first week everyone is reading everyone else's pieces anyway, because we want to. Professor Kinder and Irina are truly one-of-a-kind as a team, and Auvillar is the perfect place to write. The Internet sabbatical is crucial. I really can't imagine radically altering any part of this course, but I guess if I had to I would say replace one of the Petit Palais days with an Horloge day (Friday?)\r\n\r\nas a sidenote, I do remember people saying that it was difficult to switch from a Thursday macro deadline to a Wednesday deadline after two weeks (I went the other way, so I can't speak to that), but I can't really think of any way to change that. It didn't seem like a huge deal! ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized (as are the weekend trips, thanks to the wonderful Irina!), and Professor Kinder was excellent at engaging students in thoughtful conversations each class meeting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student who is serious about the craft of nonfiction, and who can fully throw themselves into the complete experience. I think some students who were less invested in the internet ban and in the daily production of creative work struggled a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. It is an incredible experience. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity that anyone is lucky to have. I would tell them: \r\n\r\nThe course will significantly improve your writing. It will also make you a more critical reader and a better editor. You will read interesting materials and write many pieces that you're proud of.\r\n\r\nYou will have a culturally immersive experience. Living in Auvillar is a wonderful experience. You will meet interesting locals, eat delicious food, and explore an incredible region of the world. All of these experiences will give you more inspiration for your writing.\r\n\r\nYou will have an absolutely amazing professor and course assistant. ",
            "\u00a0I would, without a doubt, recommend this course to any student at Yale. Effective writing is an essential skill in any career field and this course, while focusing on travel writing and writing about place, helps all writers find their voice and explain themselves in ways that add a human element readers can relate to. Regardless of the issue students feel most passionate about, the course helps students express the importance of their interests to others in the most effective way. Sharing our writing among the student group was also an incredible way of meeting new friends in an intellectual environment without the pressure of competition and the dangers of comparison since every person has a different writing style and is evaluated on different grounds. This is made possible by the careful attention of Professor Kinder and the small group size. The course assistant also did an incredible job of planning interactive activities and diversifying the weekend itinerary in a way that allowed us to learn more about France without losing our focus on the work at hand. Irina Markina was an unforgettable aid to our understanding of Auvillar and each city we visited afterwards, and she was an essential aspect of our immersion in a completely new place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only to students who are willing to actively engage with the curriculum. I think the program is the most amazing month I've spent as a traveller, student, friend, writer but I think that was dependent on my wanting to partake in a program like this. I think I would recommend this course to any student who loves writing and wants to spend hours improving that craft. It's an amazing opportunity to hone in on one focus and work with a cohort of similarly-driven peers to create mass content and develop as writers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This has been an eye-opening experience in writing, and living together. It has made me conscious of just how engaging learning can be, and also of how one writes, or communicates about places that they are strangers to. This course has had a large impact on how I write and see the world, and \r\nI would love for every student to be able to experience something like this over the course of their semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It is a truly exceptional and unique academic experience! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. It is definitely a commitment, but one that is worthwhile! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. It is certainly a gem of the Yale College experience, to be able to travel to a location as beautiful as Auvillar and to focus on one thing and one thing only. It's a refreshing break from the school year without losing the best parts of what it means to be a Yale student. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially if you have a fear of writing on a strict deadline, you should take this course! While you will certainly become a better writer, more than that, you will befriend a dozen other students whose bright and infectious energy will inspire you everyday to get up an write and who you will always feel comfortable turning to for help. This is the most academically and emotionally supportive class I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you are reading this because you have the chance to go to Auvillar, GO. I really don't know any other way to say it. This course will make you a better writer you will see your sentences smooth and your ideas clarify before your eyes. And you get to write about yourself! About yourself and the places you've been and the people who have been there with you! Who gets to do that??? And it doesn't stop thereyou get to do this while sitting on a terrace in the June sun in southwestern France while eating a nectarine from the corner store or a fresh baguette from the bakery, or you can go down and write by the river, or you can go to the lookout and and write while watching the vineyards. You eat three-course meals every weekday and travel on the weekends. Professor Kinder is a life-changing professorshe has such an eye for editing and such an ability to do so compassionately (and incredible dedicationyou get your essays back so fast, and you have one-on-one conferences with her every week). Irina (your course assistant) is one of the most lovely and rigorously organized people I've ever metshe makes your relationships with people in town happen, she makes your weekend trips happen, she makes your cultural education happen. If you're scared of the Internet sabbatical, don't beit turns out to be much easier than you expect it to be, and it's one of the greatest gifts this course gives you. \r\n\r\nI left a slice of my heart in Auvillar. GO! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class will change your life, your writing, your perspective. Living and writing in this place, with strangers who become friends and experiences that become essays, is easily the highlight of anyone's college experience. "
