            "\u00a0Different sociological and philosophical approaches to violence, including a variety of contemporary authors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about violence and its different forms (e.g. symbolic violence). I also learned a lot about incorporating concepts across disciplines through both the very diverse set of readings (with respect to field and ideas) and through the final paper. Probably not a universally applicable thing, but I personally feel that my reading comprehension and analytical skills improved immensely by sheer virtue of doing the dense readings every week. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a base in political philosophy in this class and I found it accessible as this was my first philosophy class. I now feel more comfortable reading philosophy and writing about it too. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic ",
            "\u00a0I engaged with, and attained a working knowledge, of absolutely fascinating--and essential--thinkers like Ball, Bourdieu, Popper, Arendt, Foucault, Derrida, Ricoeur, and more. The course both sharpened my philosophical-abstract thinking and equipped me with the intellectual tools to explicate and critique theories of violence, nonviolence, and reason in politics. The course guides students through the dense forest of structuralist and post-structuralist philosophy, thereby supplying a insightful overview of broader debates in contemporary philosophy concerning metaphysics, history, and reason. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the landscape of the theories of political violence, especially those concerning post-structuralist continental philosophers. I understood how to approach these philosophers and how their ideas on violence differ. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kapustin is a phenomenal lecturer, and you will learn so much in this class about violence. He's a great seminar leader with a unique ability to help students work through difficult and dense material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only real weakness I can think of is the length of the final paper. Personally, I had a lot going on this finals period and to have a 15-18 page paper which counts for a huge part of our grade be due was quite stressful and unnecessary in my opinion. I think the class would've benefitted from having two \"midterm exams\" and a shorter final paper (maybe 9-12 pages), rather than 1 midterm and the giant final paper like we did. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely the material we covered. The syllabus was full of dense readings, but it was also a survey of readings with very important and intriguing philosophical and political ideas. For example, we learned about Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital (through symbolic violence), a very important idea and frameworks in his respective field.\r\n\r\nI think the one improvement could be a better classroom environment to facilitate class discussion. While many evaluations mention how students gain a lot from Professor Kapustin taking such a central role in the discussion, I think students would still benefit from more frequently engaging with one another. The classroom environment was such that students addressed the professor rather than the students when discussing the readings, which I think is contrary to what a seminar environment is meant to do. That said, Professor Kapustin's \"monologues\" (as he called them) were excellent and passionate, something which many professors lack. \r\n\r\nPerhaps a solution would be to post discussion questions ahead of class to ensure that students have the chance to think deeply about the readings and come into class with something to say. Oftentimes, the sheer denseness of the readings made it difficult to get anything out of them before Professor Kapustin helped us decipher them in class through the questions he would ask us. Even then, however, there was often confusion about what exactly a question was trying to get at. I think posting several straightforward prep questions (i.e. questions to think about as we do the readings) would make discussion more rich and help facilitate clash of ideas between students. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kapustin is a wonderful professor and made the class really enjoyable. The readings were expertly selected to foster interesting discussions. It was sometimes difficult to tell what readings we were supposed to read for each week though which made for some confusion. This class is very theoretical but there are opportunities, like in the final paper, to apply that theory to real life situations which I found enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic but the professor could do less lecturing and more debate moderating ",
            "\u00a0like half the class is people going into finance/consulting, which is weird for a class in part about structural/capitalist violence. there's like no self-awareness. people look at their bain emails and then give their thoughts on how poverty entrenches racial divisions. it's hard to take the class seriously in such a no-stakes environment ",
            "\u00a0As with Kapustin's other classes, pretty much everything has been calibrated to near-perfection: insightful and focused lectures, fascinating--sometimes even mind-blowing--readings, fruitful class discussions, and enlightening themes which grow more vivid and nuanced with each passing week. Even considering the stiff competition, Professor Kapustin might be the best lecturer I've had in my four years at Yale. The only weakness, if we can call it that, is the limited time allotted to parse through dense philosophical material. We fell behind schedule because at times we couldn't cover everything we needed in the course of one session. As a result, we had to drop a few thinkers entirely, which is a shame because every one Kapustin includes on the syllabus is worth engaging in some shape or form. Still, that's not a bad \"weakness\" to have, especially when I learned so much from the thinkers we did engage (shout-out to the especially brilliant sessions on Ball, Kojeve, Bourdieu, Popper, and Foucault). ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely interesting and intellectually stimulating. I believe it gives great insight into how political violence is structured and instantiated. Logistically, I would have enjoyed a more obvious curricular setting, a more defined modular or historical structure. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible lectures! More feedback would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin is simply fabulous. His passion for the topic makes no class boring, and the syllabus is well crafted for both breadth and depth. the only suggestion i can think of would be to hold a bit more strictly to schedule because our disconnect with the syllabus made for occasionally confusing reading assignments. I also think that the course often worked tangentially to Marx and because of his seminal role in conceptions of political violence I would like to see his writings play a more direct role in the readings and discussions "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! 100%. ",
            "\u00a0I would, with some reservations. Professor Kapustin is an excellent instructor and is more than happy to meet with students to clarify material, so as an instructor, he is excellent. However, do not go into the class expecting to have in depth discussions with your classmates on a regular basis. While these happen from time to time, the classroom environment definitely leans toward Professor Kapustin taking the lead in class and students mostly direct all their comments to him rather than to their classmates. While you learn a lot, this is mostly through Professor Kapustin's excellent monologues.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that this class be taken later in one's Yale career. While I academically benefitted IMMENSELY from taking it as an underclassman, I don't think that I was able to contribute as meaningfully as other students (through no fault of Professor Kapustin's). This was just my first time dealing with very difficult texts and not nearly enough philosophical exposure to feel truly fluent in class discussions. That said, there is not an intellectual barrier of entry to join the class; one just has to be willing to put in a lot of work if they have not had a lot of practice reading dense texts. I encourage anyone who is even remotely interested to shop it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. I now feel comfortable questioning the foundations on which political or everyday actions lie in a way I couldn't before. This course gave me wonderful insight and we got to read great works by Arendt, Bourdieu, Foucault, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin has a remarkable ability to make the most complex ideas simple and be is like a walking political theory encyclopedia! He does a fantastic job guiding discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken a class with Professor Kapustin before, you basically know what to expect: an intellectual tour-de-force and must-take course for anyone passionate about political philosophy. Kapustin is just incredible. He's one of the best, if not the best, lecturers I've had in my four years at Yale, the type who gets you as excited as he is about the material. Regularly punctuating the semester are moments where the sheer brilliance of his insights just induces an adrenaline rush. He manages to render legible and almost simple the most incomprehensible of texts. Even more impressive is the meticulous construction and thematic cohesiveness of the course as a whole--Kapustin has selected and organized the readings in a manner that allows them to engage and critique one another, often in ways you don't realize until you're reviewing your notes. The result is an epic conversation happening across literally centuries of time and thousands of miles on the subjects of violence, nonviolence, history, reason, and metaphysics all distilled into dense but digestible weekly two-hour sessions that are reliably intellectually stimulating. Even the less interesting material is of some immense value in Kapustin's assured hands. He's that good. \r\n\r\nThis was my second course with Kapustin--first was \"Moral Choices in Politics\"--and it's not immediately obvious to me which one is better. You can't really go wrong with either. That said, I think this one was a little more intellectually challenging, and the syllabus is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to figures essential to contemporary philosophical thinking: Arendt, Bourdieu, Foucault, Derrida, you name it. Even if you don't buy many of their ideas--and I certainly didn't--you will grow as a person and as a thinker by engaging them. Doing so isn't always easy, but it is always rewarding. \r\n\r\nAgain, this is a must-take. When it comes to political philosophy, there's very little, if anything, at Yale that beats Kapustin's seminars. If nothing, take the class for Kapustin himself, who is as kind as he is brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0This course is exceptional if you have any interest in the continental understandings of societal violence. Also, if you are a philosophy student, the actual department tends to lean heavily on the analytic side so this would be an exceptional way to explore post-structuralist continentalists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Totally would recommend. taking a class with Kapustin should be on everybody's Yale bucket list, and this course is a perfect one to choose. the work is interesting and manageable and professor Kapustin runs great classes. "
