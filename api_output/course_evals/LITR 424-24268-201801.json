            "\u00a0I learned about the history of comedy and read several theories of comedy. I also learned about the distinction between tragedy and comedy, as well as between old comedy and modern comedy. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most valuable things I learned in this class is how to balance making big claims -- about texts, plural -- with patient and thorough analysis of text, singular. The structure of the class (topical: \"On Comedy\") provided the perfect of blend theory and primary literature, and encouraged us to come to  significant conclusions about not just the way particular texts work, but the way a particular genre, mode, and effect -- the comedic -- works in and through them. This is a much more ambitious lens than pure formalism, and, I think, more rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the knowledge I developed by taking this course was an accumulation of philosophical lenses through which to read and interpret comedy. Sometimes, these lenses would clearly be related to comedy; however, in works like Marx's Alienation of Labor, we took essays that were not written in mind for comedy, but could be used to interpret it regardless.  While most of the time was spent on investigating these lenses, we also covered specific works of comedy, especially in the latter half of the semester. "

            "\u00a0I thought the syllabus and readings were put together wonderfully. I liked the chronological aspect. I did feel some readings, like Joyce and Derrida, were a little out of place and a bit overly abstract. But on the whole I liked the design of the course a lot, especially the expose/midterm paper/ term paper process. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were wonderful! Presentations gave each student a chance to critically engage with course materials. My one constructive criticism: It would have been nice if we had time to read more primary texts, alongside theory. I think some of our strongest discussions happened when we had literature to sink our teeth into. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the content.  It is definitely very interesting material when you get into it.  However, I think the course could have been improved by grounding theoretical texts more often in comedic works.  I think that more focus should have been placed by the professor on close readings of the texts, and we also should have spent more time getting familiar with the texts before diving into more loftier claims.  Another big strength of the course was the professor and TA's flexibility and willingness to work with you outside of class on the writing project and oral presentation.\r\n\r\nI think that the texts--more specifically the sections within the text--could have been chosen a bit more carefully.  There could have been more guidance on specific parts to focus on, or perhaps leading questions that we could have kept in mind during the reading. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are familiar with and interested in philosophy ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. I learned so much beyond comedy, and we read great works of comedy and secondary analysis. Anyone interested in aesthetics or dramatic theory should take it. I was a bit worried that I wasnt prepared for the course because I hadnt read a lot about theater, but acclimating was not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the subject matter was so interesting, and I believe the course will improve a lot in further iterations.  The structure of the class is not too time intensive, and lets you study two topics further in depth: one for your oral presentation and one for your research project.   Personally, working on these two projects were the most enjoyable parts of the class. "
