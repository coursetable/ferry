Specific focus areas include rheological techniques, basic fluid and thermal dynamics, Van der Waal forces, and colloidal suspensions.  \r\n\r\nMost importantly, this course has an overarching focus on the nature of research itself.

There is a tremendous amount of student interaction and lots of interesting examples to real world physical systems.  The capstone projects also provided an outstanding mechanism for combining all the skills learned throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe only negative is that with all the discussion and student interaction, the course regularly runs overtime.
