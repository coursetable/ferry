            "\u00a0I learned countless skills in this course. It honestly changed my outlook on the history of art and how to approach understanding a painting. This course was foundational in my Yale experience and eye-opening. Not only did I become extremely literate in tons of philosophical and historical research papers describing paintings or movements, but I also learned how to appreciate a painting and how to extract the meaning. This course has ignited both a passion and curiosity of art history and art. This course was more than an art history course; it was a course teaching us how to understand art and place paintings in the grander historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about art and history and how to look at art through a historical, philosophical perspective. I learned how to read complex material and then discuss it at length. ",
            "\u00a0The most valuable skill I learned in this class was how to analyze a painting while considering its historical context. This was really cool, especially considering that I had absolutely no ability when it came to looking at and analyzing art in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest skill that I developed by taking this course was the ability to conduct research and a proper analysis for a question that I proposed. Taking such a course exposed me to the various outlets regarding how to tackle material, and extract the necessary information needed for me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses in this course. The way it was structured where students would each take turns opening the seminar, the three essays which forced us to analyze a painting, analyze a primary source, and finally analyze a painting and its public response with primary courses were exercises that were challenging but fulfilling and propelled me as both a writer, researcher and critical thinker. It is a pity it wont be offered again as NZG (the professor) is going somewhere else. Yale is missing out! ",
            "\u00a0This course was really fun and interesting but I think it could have varied the type of material we read a little more or tried different things in class than just discussion. But I loved going to museums and galleries and learning about the art in person. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty disorganized. I was never sure what topic we were supposed to be learning about or how one day's discussion fit with that of another day. It is a good class to give exposure to the world or art and history, something that I did not think I had any interest in, but I believe I could have gotten a little more out of the class if I understood the flow and organization of what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strength, the teaching was always conducted with a sense of passion that generated in conversation. \r\nWeakness, the material at times was difficult to approach and at times felt disjointed with the assignments for the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It was unreal! As a non-humanities major, I gained a whole new appreciation for the arts. Everything about the course was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would especially if they are interested in art because this course involved looking at art from a new perspective and learning about it historically and philosophically rather than just objectively. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Engaging conversation, class camaraderie, and great fun. Professor Gentele is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0If you really love art and/or history, maybe. The readings were extremely heavy and often boring. The assignments were very challenging and felt unmanageable at times, but I will admit, they were very rewarding and I gained valuable analytic and research skills that will prove helpful in the future years. Nonetheless, the workload and demand was more than a typical first year seminar, so keep that in mind. It is especially painful if you don't have much of an interest in the topic. "
