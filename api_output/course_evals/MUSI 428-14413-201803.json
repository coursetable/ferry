            "\u00a0Supercollider. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Markov chains and context free grammars, cellular automata and L systems and applied this to Music. Also learned how to code in supercollider ",
            "\u00a01. Working with music, midi files and audio in general\r\n2. Creative applications of probability ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to the various paradigms and techniques associated with algorithmic computer music. Exploring various stochastic and \"creative\" computing models, we tackled the problem of whether, and if so - how, it would be possible to write a creative composition program. ",
            "\u00a0I think i gained some concept as to how frameworks can be developed around creative thinking. However, it was unclear exactly how I could use these frameworks myself. ",
            "\u00a0Some conceptual ideas about human creativity and machine creativity, some appreciation for compositional techniques used to create music outside the realm of acoustic instruments and human instrumentalists, and fundamental skill for programming in SuperCollider. "

        [
            "\u00a0A lot of overlap with CPSC 432. But the frameworks Scott went over in this class were cool. Im not sure algorithmic composition is the best descriptor but its close. ",
            "\u00a0S: Demonstrations and videos were very interesting. The music was usually fun to listen to. ",
            "\u00a0There werent enough psets to prepare us for the final project. I would have appreciated weekly psets that were about as half as long as the psets we had. (So that we wouldnt have to do really Long psets every week but would do them more frequently.) ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Fascinating content\r\nWeakness: Bad organization ",
            "\u00a0This course should be taught after CPSC 432. I happened to take CPSC 432 before this class and was well-equipped to apply the various compositional paradigms we learned with musically relevant sounds (which I learned to create in 432). Most of the class was forced to make music using default sounds in SuperCollider, which are not very musically interesting or motivational while trying to apply abstract computer science concepts to music. ",
            "\u00a0Scott is kind and likable.  However, I feel like he lacks a cohesive narrative or \"point\" in his lectures.  I sometimes walked away from class not actually sure what I learned. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that the concepts of creativity were interesting to think about and talk about, and I enjoyed engaging with the projects, but overall I found most of the work unsatisfying. I wish we could have had more assignments to practice writing code to implement the concepts we talked about in class. We only had about 4 code-based assignments throughout the semester, so I still don't feel like I have the skills to write anything complex in SuperCollider. Many of the mathematical/heuristic topics we talked about in class (cellular automata, L systems, chaotic systems) were never included in any of our assignments, so even though I developed some basic knowledge of them, I never had anywhere to apply that knowledge. I would have liked it if we had small weekly programming assignments (about the size of the first or second homework assignment) just so we could get hands-on experience with the concepts and we could better remember them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wish Dr. Petersen could have told us more about the reasons scholars have for studying this field. As a result, during some lectures it seemed like Dr. Petersen was the only person in the room who had a real enthusiasm for the topic he was talking about. I recognize that the course material is complex and difficult, but at times it seemed to be too niche. I thought there was too much focus on just a small group of musicians; Dr. Petersen mentioned Xenakis during almost every class period and looked to Xenakis' work to provide examples of almost every concept we talked about. Patterns like this made me wonder about the reasons for the Music and CS departments choosing to offer this course, if the field really is this small. \r\n\r\nI thought the course could have been much more engaging if the course focused on enabling students to get creative. I really enjoyed working on the midterm project and final project, to see how much I could do. I think if we had more assignments to practice coding and problem solving, and if we spent more time talking as a class about our own creative and musical ideas, then I would have learned a lot more.

            "\u00a0Yes! Scott is great and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the patience to learn a language that isn't C. Also if you think randomness is cool. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt really recommend this course to a CS major with 0 Music theory knowledge because I firmly believe that you have to understand Music in order to make Music. Also Scott can go on really Long tangents at times that are completely unrelated to class material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - its interesting and fascinating - but needs better organization ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student wanting to receive a survey of algorithmic composition and computer music, but I'd recommend they take CPSC 432 first. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course. Anyone Computer Science major with a love for music should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fun class.  I learned about the intersection of computation and creative construction of music, and that was fun.  However, I think I would recommend other classes to peers.  This was okay, but Yale has so much to offer that other classes would win out. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if I knew they were specifically interested in algorithms and machine creativity. For anyone primarily interested in music and not interested in mathematics, there was not much for them here; most of the concepts we talked about were far more mathematical than musical in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great concept, but ultimately falls short in many respects because it tries to cater itself to a variety of audiences with varied backgrounds in computer music. I don't recommend unless you are looking for an easy, if somewhat dissatisfying CS elective. "
