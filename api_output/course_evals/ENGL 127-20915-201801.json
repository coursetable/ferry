            "\u00a0How to use resources such as librarians, MLA search, and online archives in essays; how to really talk about literature ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep and broad understanding of American Literature. The course material was not white-washed nor heteronormative. I gained a richer understanding of America's voice through our readings and discussion in the class. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to introducing me to works in the canon of American Literature, this class taught me to connect different works of literature in meaningful ways and to better express my ideas through writing. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the course, we reflected on the value and limitations of knowing an author's biography, as well as (especially in Carver's case) the editorial process, when reading a work of literature. These were probably not questions I would ever have considered had I read these works alone, and I learned so much not only about the particular books we were reading but about the process of reading itself. As a result of our class conversations, I learned how to put works of literature from vastly different eras, genres, and movements in conversation with one another, and in doing so, I learned more about the trajectory of literary trends across American history. I also became more familiar with resources such as the Bienecke and online archives. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my skills in analytical writing, and took some risks in my essay-writing that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how develop insightful literary analysis supported by close readings of the text and how to write strong essays that examined in-depth a particular insight. ",
            "\u00a0As Professor Goldsby explains on the first day of this class, it's not a survey course of all American Literature--that would surely be impossible for one semester. Instead, this class examines a small number of selected texts in order to explore the question of what it means to be an American writer and American literary work. Goldsby's ENGL 127 course also gave me the opportunity to write multiple shorter essays (~6-8 pages each), for which we were permitted to develop our own topics//choose which texts we wished to write about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read works of literature through a critical lens and trace the evolution of American literary movements across eras and historical and cultural contexts. I became more adept at incorporating archival materials and authorial biographies into my understanding of each work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A clear strength of this course was the material we read. I do not think I would have read half of these pieces had it not been for this class. I am all the more grateful because of it. A weakness is that assignment expectations were not very clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! never change. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Goldsby is AMAZING. Definitely take this course with her!! The way she shapes class discussions is phenomenal -- she's great at presenting ideas for consideration yet also letting the conversation develop organically. I found her comments on papers to be helpfully critical and encouraging. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all aspects of this class, but a particular strength of this course was the classroom environment. There was never any pretentiousness or obnoxiousness, which is in part a testament to the way Prof. Goldsby ran the class as well as to the other students in the room. There's nothing I can think of that I would have changed about the class -- the workload was definitely above average, but I think this class was worth it. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great literature discussion! The only way I would improve it is making sure that announcements/busy work don't take up too much discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent professor, great selection of books/poetry, essay prompts flexible, discussions were interesting, very helpful feedback ",
            "\u00a0This class was filled with strengths. The texts were superb, and I loved that we had the opportunity to put poetry and prose in dialogue with one another. I also really appreciated the opportunity we had to visit New York together as a class--the Stephen Shore exhibition was illuminating, and the trip also provided a nice venue for discussing ENGL 127 themes outside of class.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for future improvement: because the rest of the course reading list was so strong, Thomas Pynchon's \"The Crying of Lot 49\" struck me as a weak spot, as it didn't seem to inspire as fruitful class discussions. I also think, in light of recent sexual misconduct allegations, it will be worthwhile to seriously consider whether Junot Daz's \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" should continue to be taught as part of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an outstanding survey of American literature, connecting texts across eras in surprising and exciting ways and clearly situating texts within literary movements and cultural epochs. I became more confident in conducting research using primary sources and databases and constructing bibliographies. "

            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course to anybody who loves to read and talk about literature. The students in the course were all intellectually invested, and together we had some really great discussions. The readings can be long, but if you pace yourself well it's easy to stay on top of. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to take a work-intensive English class. You really need to work for it, though. This is not an easy class even for someone who enjoys reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as someone who is not majoring in English, this has still been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! It's a great course for English and non-English majors alike. The book selection is engaging and you get to read a Norton Critical Edition that Professor Goldsby edited. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! This was the best class I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Goldsby is incredible. She takes so much time to get to know her students and creates a genuine, open classroom environment. The field trips and out-of-class events were always fun. Many of the readings were truthfully not my favorite books I've ever read, but Prof. Goldsby always made them interesting and worth reading. I loved going to class every morning and doing all of our readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would! A straightforward and very engaging literature seminar, with a knock-out professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are looking to read and analyze some great books and improve your writing skills! Definitely try to take this class with Professor Goldsby! She is a very warm, kind, and thoughtful professor and really listens to all her students' thoughts during discussion. She is very devoted and loves helping her students improve their writing--she is very meticulous in reading essays and offers very detailed comments and she will make time to meet with you to talk over ideas or to get a clearer idea of how to further improve your essay. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. In-class discussions were thrilling, the curriculum was masterfully designed, and the essays often afforded you the freedom to analyze whatever most interested you. Youd be lucky to experience the erudition of Professor Goldsby. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is phenomenal. Whether you are a first-year or junior, you will learn something from ENGL 127's reading list and Professor Goldsby's incredible teaching. The average reading load is completely reasonable (an average of 100 pages or so for each class) and the three required essays give you the opportunity to spread your work pretty evenly throughout the semester. Also, I found classes to be so engaging that I genuinely looked forward to each Tuesday and Thursday morning to see how our discussion would illuminate the previous night's reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the most formative I've taken in college. It made me a better reader, thinker, researcher, and writer, and introduced me to some classic texts in a powerful context that made each work come alive. The discussions were engaging and Professor Goldsby was fiercely dedicated to her students. I feel lucky to have taken this course. "
