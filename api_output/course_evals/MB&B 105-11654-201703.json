Rather, they were purely memorization of the slides, and often asked questions about minute details that were barely discussed in class. The class rewards the wrong sort of learning. ",

They're uninteresting and unrelated to the lectures, so they seem pointless and no one wants to be there, which makes participation that much harder. The class itself was interesting but the exams were way harder than the intensity level of the class itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures are pretty good, most of the material is interesting, professors are engaging, and TAs are genuinely interested in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterms are each written by a different team so vary drastically. For instance, the second midterm was completely unlike the first, despite TAs assuring that it would be similar. The practice questions circulated for the second midterm had nothing to do (literally no overlap in terms of topic or content) with a single question on the second midterm. A little more transparency on what is expected on midterms would be appreciated. ",

            "\u00a0It keeps things interesting and relevant to current events without going too in depth to the details of the science involved. Tests sometimes focused on nitty details from lectures that didn't have much relevance to the big ideas of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that for the most part, material was well-suited to non-majors and framed in an understandable way (I would say Gendron's lectures might have been the exception; they were far more difficult to grasp). That is an expected strength, as most people take this because they hear it's an easy science credit. The biggest weakness - and it is a big one - is the organization of the course. It was extremely unclear who was writing the exams at any given point, what would be covered on the exams, what we were expected to know from lecture, and what information was supplementary. I would say it is also not conducive to a student's learning to have three different lecturers, particularly because the first, Prof. Carlson, is by far the best, and students are likely evaluating their potential success/interest in the course based on his lectures, and might be thrown for a curveball later on (as I was). Performance on the second test tended to go down, maybe as a result of this -- the specificity of certain questions on exams were also a major, major weakness. The course needs to focus more on concepts, less on minutia, if it is indeed a course for non-majors. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the interesting lectures, the weaknesses were that the exams were not always what was expected. In review sessions it was stated to focus on certain things and then those topics were not on the exam at all. ",

            "\u00a0I guess there is music in the beginning but otherwise, there is no strength to this class. The course director Rachel is opaque and doesn't really care about doing her job. She sits there, turns on the lights every once in a while and that's it. The exams are unclear, the material is rote memorization, and the topics are dull. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this first section of the course, hated the second, and liked the third. The second was absolutely unbearable. Get rid of it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good survey of different scientific concepts, instructors were engaging, straightforward material, relevant topics. Weaknesses: Very large class (many students who were off-task), incorrect time allotted to course (it never lasted past 12:30, but the official time allotted to the course was 11:35-12:50 - lecturers would rush to finish by 12:30 needlessly) ",

            "\u00a0I wish the professors would have been on the same page on the difficulty of exams because with each professor it seemed the expected knowledge shifted and it made it hard to study for the exams. The strengths however were the variety of areas we studied and were exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I thought the course did a good job of appealing to non-science majors and making the scientific topics understandable and relatable for us. The only thing I would change was making an effort to go over more fully the specific scientific processes we learn about since those are what show up on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a very manageable workload, and I liked the opportunity to learn from different professors each month about different topics. Each professor was very knowledgable, and it was a great opportunity to be exposed to many issues that affect us today. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of interesting topics and the professors were engaging. However, I did not like the way students were evaluated. The exams were strictly fact memorization, so I felt as though I wasn't able to absorb the material in an effective way. A lot of memorization is required for the exams, but I think a better way to test the students would be with more comprehensive questions or short answer. Memorizing and writing down facts doesn't incentivize students to actually learn the interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I think there were some gaps between what we were taught in the lecture and what came up on the exams. The information we were taught and asked about was very precise, even though the powerpoints were generally vague and not precise.\r\n\r\nI almost never missed lecture. They were easy to follow and I listened intently. But it was difficult to nail the information perfectly and then it wasn't available anywhere else to revise from. That was tough. ",
            "\u00a0The testing epectations could have been made clearer. Often Id feel i was rote memorizing teh slides only to find that they wanted different answers instead. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lecture topics and lecturers were extremely engaging, but one thing that bothered me was that the test topics were incredibly specific while the lecturers only highlighted more general topics. ",

            "\u00a0I though that the course was really great! The TAs were all super nice and the professors really wanted to teach! I felt like the first exam was very memorization based, more than the others, and I think that it could have been more conceptual. ",

Sometimes, however, the exams were worded in a confusing way or seemed to reflect information that wasn't particularly stressed as important in lecture. ",

I had a wonderful Teaching Fellow (Anna) who definitely helped all of us in her section do better in the course. The content of the course is interesting and the topics are broadly relevant. There is an appropriate and fair workload. Weaknesses: I thought some of the issues related to opioid abuse and addiction were handled in a heavy-handed way. For all professors but Gendron and Koleske in particular, the slides really did not reflect a lot of the content they expected you to know on the midterms. So if your in-class notes weren't amazing, you basically had no way of studying for the things you were tested on. I think the professors need to work a little bit harder to make sure that they provide the testable content in some way other than verbally, because it makes it really hard to study otherwise. ",

            "\u00a0I came into this course with a pretty strong science background - AP Biology, essentially - and thought it could be more challenging, or get more into the depth of certain scientific pathways (ex. action potential in a neuron) without necessarily testing on that material. The exams seemed to be based primarily on memorization of the facts on the slides the professors had, which were posted, so it wasn't terrible- but I thought the random information we had to memorize covered more breadth and was scattered than true depth/knowledge of a given topic.

Need to know the names of bacteria shapes, etc ",

            "\u00a0Throughout the course,  the professors made the information accessible to students and made concepts interesting to learn. However, one of the largest weaknesses were the TAs, who were confusing during midterm review sessions and led to students doing worse on some exams, and the structure of the exams fluctuated in a way that made the course much more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a really great survey course for those without a strong science background. I found the lectures engaging and relevant, even though I wasn't expecting them to be, and the professors are all really knowledgeable and fun. The workload is definitely manageable and the readings are mostly journalistic articles rather than scientific papers, which I liked. Since the three professors each write an exam, it's a little hard to know what to expect on them because they're all different. ",

Also enjoyed the sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the lack of communication between the TFs and teachers about exams that made preparation extremely difficult. The expectations for assignments were extremely confusion. In addition, it would have been good for the sections to reiterate the material from class. ",
            "\u00a0Writing and speaking in section ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: how it is structured. I really like the three modules idea and how there is an exam at the end of each module, as it takes a lot of the stress off the class. Additionally, there is no final exam (just a third module exam), which is great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the quality of the TFs was not consistent, some were great but others were unhelpful both in answering questions about the biology content (since at their grad school level they specialize in very specific things) and general requirements of the course ",

            "\u00a0This course was good in that it helped me learn information at a high level, but the grading seemed arbitrary - consistently arbitrary in that the tfs all grade the same question on exams, but arbitrary nonetheless. I think this course should do a better job of outlining exactly what information will be on the exams as for several of our tests, the \"learning objectives\" heavily emphasized by the professors in class, weren't even the material on which we were tested. I think that the grades and exam performance is a poor reflection of what information students learned and could apply. Instead the grades are reflections of whether students took note of minute details on slides. ",

The readings sometimes felt superfluous, in that the same topics were discussed in sufficient detail in the lectures, but I thought they were interesting. Perhaps if we were assigned more complex readings that we were then tested on, or if we discussed the readings themselves in lecture or section, that would help integrate them better into the course. ",

I liked that there were three different professors who taught three different segments of the class; this allowed for me to learn about diverse areas of biology from experts in their fields. I also liked that there were midterm exams at the end of each section. I thought the exams were overall fair and I appreciated that there were three of them to test our knowledge. "

None of these is really that difficult if you put in some effort, and most of it is pretty interesting.

However, I would recommend that any student go into this course knowing that it is not necessarily an easy A unless you're good at straight memorization, and that the bureaucratic nature of the course can make it difficult to be successful (organization is TERRIBLE; none of the TAs knew what was going to be on the exam at any given time but would act in review sessions as though they did. There seems to be a weird hierarchy of knowledge, and no one knows who is writing the tests (TAs or profs)). The easiest way to be successful in the course is memorizing the slides, which is somewhat sad - if you're trying to really understand concepts, you've come to the wrong place. My friends who are good at memorization loved this class. My friends who are bad at memorization but enjoy science hated it. That probably says something. That being said, though, 2/3 units (Carlson's and Koleske's) were really interesting, and I enjoyed lectures on these topics. Gendron's unit was not, though I'm not sure whether that's because of his subject matter or because he wasn't overly adept at explaining concepts, considering none of us have a science background (I'm assuming).

In this course, you cover many scientific concepts in rather great detail. This requires you to take the class seriously and study a lot for the exams. If you are a non-STEM major and are interested in getting to know some real science, go ahead and take this class; it's very well taught and the TAs are great.

If you're an upperclassman looking for a science credit, it's also great. Just take this course. ",

All of the information is on the lecture slides so that's super helpful. The lectures are fun to go to and the professors are engaging -- they know that no one in the class is a science major. The information is interesting and pertinent to everyday life because the professors make sure that the biology is connected to issues in society, which we also learn about. The midterm exams were tough and you definitely had to study for them, but there were three of them so plenty of room to improve. "
