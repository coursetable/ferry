            "\u00a0Very little- anything I learned came from our semester project and I wouldn't consider those \"skills\" as much as knowledge about a particular geographic region. ",
            "\u00a0An overview of the theory of coastal management, as well as some specific knowledge relating to offshore drilling, wetlands, fisheries, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Much more practical knowledge of a number of issues facing coastal cities/regions in America (and around the world, to a lesser degree). Experience engaging with \"governance gaps\" and the policy sciences. ",
            "\u00a0In general, the knowledge, skills, and insights that I develop by taking this course were a landscape analysis of coastal governance. It was exactly what I wanted to learn. By covering it from such a wide lens, I was able to capture a lot of what was going on, from several angles, and gain insights into how to better manage and govern coasts. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a better understanding of policy frameworks related to coastal management. It gave me a background on the different coastal services, the policies that governments have used to manage them and the strengths and weaknesses of these policies. Our course focused heavily on flooding in coastal cities, but that appears to change each year. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the different stakeholders who are involved with domestic coastal governance ",

            "\u00a0This class was not at all what I expected nor hoped it would be. I thought we would learn more about the intersection of policy, management, and science. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit less than expected. Readings were very well chosen, but there were so many that I never had the time to read them. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly well, I learned about most of the things I had identified as areas for improvement in my own understanding ",
            "\u00a0This class aligned well with my expectations. I did wish I left with more technical skills. I also was hoping to work with live actors, rather than have the sole audience of our final project be the professor. ",

            "\u00a0This was one of the most disorganized courses I have ever taken. It often fell to the students to design the course and self determine what we should be taking away from various lectures and readings. The number of readings assigned was WAY TOO HIGH and so people would get overwhelmed and not know what to prioritize. In addition, mot classes it was just peers lecturing fellow students which was not what we all paid high tuition dollars for. The semester projects should have been started earlier and the objectives of that project should have been better defined. The professor also should reduce the number of readings so that they are a manageable amount for a grad student and then help guide discussions on those readings rather than leave it all to the students. ",
            "\u00a0Too many readings make it impossible to read all the articles each week. I would much more prefer to have the majority of content taught by the professor during class, with some preparatory readings, rather than having most of the content in the readings. Having student presentations on readings was not an effective way for me to learn the material. \r\nThe professor has lots of knowledge - would have loved to learn more from him! ",
            "\u00a0Very dependent on class interest, which is great, but also sometimes means that expectations and deliverables are not clearly defined. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths and weaknesses of this course are both Rick. I believe that he is the best source of coastal governance information in the school, that said, he fails to leverage his greatest asset, himself. He has so much institutional and industrial knowledge but teaches the course almost entirely through the lens of other practitioners. \r\n\r\nI bought his book, and read it throughout the course. It was great. I think the course could be improved by reformatting the class that allows for fewer papers and more of his book. I think what would be great is a format that fostered deeper discussion around his work and his book. It would be great to read a chapter of his book a week, along with 1-2 papers for contrast, then had a deep discussion. \r\n\r\nWhat I would also like to see happen for this course is have the projects start much earlier. It felt very cramped in at the last minute. Also, live stakeholders would significantly improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class focused heavily on student presentations. I think I would have preferred more instructor-led lectures. Rick is a very knowledgeable man and I would have liked to hear more of the material coming from him. I think we could have had one student presentation each week and that would have been better. I think it also would have been better to have slightly fewer readings. I think students often get overwhelmed when there are too many readings and then aren't able to dive deeply into any. It would have been better to have only 2 or 3 readings each week but allow the students to spend more time with them. I also think the goals of the project should have been more clear at the beginning of the class and that students should have been working on the projects for the entire semester rather than having it feel rushed in the last few weeks. \r\n\r\nOne major strength was that the readings were really excellent and I did learn a lot from the ones I had time to read. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were a strength; however, there were too many to read every week. The individual presentations were too numerous and not in depth enough. There could be better integration between the course readings and the group project. The group project was helpful to dive deep in one specific area, but it could have been improved had we analyzed through the lens of some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the instructor could bring more structure into the class, and talk more about his knowledge and experience, in addition to what is already well done (student engagement and guidance for review of quality literature). ",
            "\u00a0Too many readings - need less readings more directed "

        [
            "\u00a0I would suggest the student shop the first class and see if the professor has adjusted the structure of the course so that they will actually get something out of it. I would also suggest that if the student enjoys a structured learning environment, they not take this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class has great potential, and the instructor has lots of knowledge! Be ready to have lots of readings - but they are well chosen and full of useful content. Unfortunately class time wasn't used the best - student presentations take most of the time rather than lectures. The instructor is very flexible though! ",
            "\u00a0Have clearly defined goals that you articulate to yourself and the instructor when taking the class ",
            "\u00a0I would tell a student that wants to take this course to stay organized and make sure to read/skim all the papers. Also, I would advise them to buy and read his book, it's great! ",
            "\u00a0This course is not very structured. Only take it if you are ok going with the flow. You can definitely learn a lot from the course, but it does require flexibility. ",
            "\u00a0Go in with an open mind! Rick has a unique way of teaching. Talk to him outside of class you'll be surprised by his wealth of experiences. ",
