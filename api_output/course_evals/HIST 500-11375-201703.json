            "\u00a0Oh man. This class pushed me harder to think about the substance and mode of my work than just about any other class I've ever taken in my life. The range of topics and approaches to writing history exposed to me in this class made me question everything I already know. On some days, it was crippling, the enormity of the questions being asked in the seminar. On other days, it was incredibly empowering and illuminating. I know that going forward, as I become more confident in the craft, I look back mostly upon the latter days when I reflect on this time in my intellectual career. Thanks, Jen and Dani! ",

            "\u00a0Different methodologies applied in history writing ",
            "\u00a0Helpful in thinking about different methods and ways of writing in history, and some of the different conversations in different sub-fields. Much of the conversation centered around different cohort members' ideas about the direction of history and the discipline. "

            "\u00a0The question of how big to make the seminars (i.e., splitting into sections vs one big round-table) is a tricky one. I really enjoyed getting to know the peers in my cohort, and I definitely got to know those in my particular seminar much more closely. But having a big round-table, I think, is just not tenable. I think it caters too much to the students that raise their hands a lot. Getting a word in sometimes was tough.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the writing assignments, I wasn't a big fan of having so much material due right at the end of the term. It made it so they all kind of ran together in my head, and I think the quality of my work suffered a little bit for it. I was definitely burnt out at that point. I think having assignments spaced out along the term gives students more time to understand what the professor's grading preferences (and idiosyncracies) are like.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, I really liked the materials. I know some students were dismissive of a few of the works that seemed further afield, but I really liked seeing the full range of approaches and questions. Some of the accompanying articles seemed like throw-away work, though, since we often barely got around to discussing them in seminar in any sort of thoroughgoing kind of way. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the books assigned were wonderful.  Some, however, were really frustrating to read (like Smith and Sewall).  I also found sections frustrating and much preferred meeting in a large group.  To the extent that the course is designed to foster camaraderie within the cohort, the sections hampered this mission in my mind.  One section generally lacked cohesion and the other closed ranks, creating an odd dynamic.  \r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to get more feedback throughout the course -- we received comments on one paper, and then had several due at the end of the semester, with little opportunity to really internalize and build on comments throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think you should keep it broken into two classes. I can't imagine how this course worked when it was everyone all together. It was nice to actually get to hear people's thoughts and to be able to have some back and forth rather than everyone just making canned comment to check the talked-in-class-box. \r\n\r\nI would space the assignments out more evenly across the semester. It felt like everything was due in a two week stretch at the end. Now, we are all adults, and I could have paced myself better. However, I think it would improve people's experience of the course, so its worth considering. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is to give students chance to know many different approaches of the discipline. \r\nWeakness is that we have too many topics. ",
            "\u00a0Helpful for getting to know cohort and thinking through your understanding of what history is and the work you want to do. Often less focused on the readings than broader themes in the discipline. "
