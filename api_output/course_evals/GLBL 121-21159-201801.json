            "\u00a0The course moves at the pace of the class, which is great. All problem sets are tailored to what we cover in lecture, and I never felt that I had to leave class with any unanswered questions. \r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, statistics is generally a quite boring subject but Professor Thomas manages to make it fun and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course is great. JT really does his absolute best to take a dry topic- statistics- and make it engaging and interesting. I think the course could be adjusted a bit- the pace seemed really slow at first and we covered the introductory material really in-depth, but then by the end of the term it seemed like we rushed through really complicated material because we had to get through it. I think there were definitely time pressures given the delay in the course's schedule, but any way to balance out the time spent on material, especially as we get into regression, would be particularly helpful. ",

            "\u00a0The TAs could be better about teaching the material rather than just reading off of the material. There isn't much feedback on performance of the psets and it's difficult to understand what you did wrong. The availability of the TAs are not great either. However, the level of material is not clearly communicated. You must go through ALL lectures. The lectures are by far your best resource. Don't use the textbook too much especially because there are a lot of additional material that isn't relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Annoying that he would post the problem sets on Thursday nights (sometimes Friday morning) and they were due on Wednesday. The answer keys for the practice exams weren't super helpful, all of them said \"See lecture notes\" for explanations. JT could have also gone through more examples of problems in class so that we had a better idea of how to do them. ",
            "\u00a0JT is a great professor. The end of the course could be a bit better organized, and perhaps a little more applied stuff (looking at research, etc.) would be worthwhile. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the instructor is energetic, friendly, and approachable. He makes every lecture fun and makes sure to tie in the statistics into public policy, grounding the sometimes abstract and intangible concepts to applicable examples. The TFs are also very helpful and friendly. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses -- this is a fantastic course. ",

            "\u00a0Loved the professor.  Pace of the class was somewhat slow, felt like we learned every concept 2 or 3 times. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic teaching team, great TAs, collaborative learning environment, JT welcomed questions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel that there were enough office hours to feel supported, maybe try adding Piazza as a viable tool\r\n For the practice midterms, when the answers say to look at the lecture notes, I know that myself and other students are generally super confused and it's difficult to find that specific information, so if maybe you could include the specific lecture or slide number that it's on would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in that it goes in depth into each concept, but I felt it went by too slowly overall, which is the expense to be paid for making sure all students understand the material thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course. Justin Thomas is an excellent instructor and a great communicator. He knows what concepts need special emphasis as well as what questions to ask the class during lecture. Justin really makes the class and knows exactly what he's doing. I feel as though I've left this class fully prepared to confront statistical information across the social sciences and how to read scientific papers with statistical information. \r\n\r\nWhile the majority of the course felt very well paced, I felt as though the end of the course felt rushed. Complex material was glossed over. This might have been due to the time lost from the snowstorm. Regardless, I would have preferred a little more clarity during lectures towards the end. \r\n\r\nAlso, Justin is probably a little bit too nice. At times, he would answer too many questions that students had and we could remain stuck on a single topic for a very long time. Throughout most of the semester he knew when to move on and how to set a strong pace, but sometimes the class just got stuck going over the same concept due to students' repetitive questions. It's hard to ask a professor to ignore student questions, but I feel confident in saying that Justin could benefit from being a little less responsive. He was always so considerate and thoughtful which is a great quality in a professor. Unfortunately, his care for his students sometimes dragged the momentum of the class.\r\n\r\nI'm really splitting hairs here. Other than those two notes I think this class is truly superb. Justin knows exactly what he's doing and was able to make a stats class completely accessible to this lowly English major. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course was its applied nature. Learning how the concepts could relate to real-world studies was fascinating and built on the knowledge of statistics I'd developed in AP Stats during high school. However, lecture was often disorganized, as was section. While Professor Thomas is a great person, I didn't feel his lectures were effective. They were often filled with tangents, and the material could easily get confusing when he didn't stick to the slides. Often I felt I learned better by studying the slides on my own. Section had similar problems, as there was no clear organization (i.e. no power points and lacking notes). Grading was also extremely inconsistent. On the midterm, for instance, deductions for small errors often seemed arbitrary and too high. Problem sets faced the same issue. Overall, I think this class needed far more organization. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher was amazing for this course. There were no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course focuses on building a good base of knowledge in statistics and pays detailed attention to learning how to evaluate research methods of others; some of the introductory material could have been covered in less time to reserve more time at the end for deeper coverage of regression, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Probably one of the best taught classes at Yale, everyone in class is engaged and actively learning which was highly refreshing. The stuff you learn you really learn very well. The textbook is also fantastic. The main weakness of the class is the pace. While the slow plod allows you to grasp everything excellently, we didnt cover much at all, and learned almost nothing new after spring break. ",
            "\u00a0This courses pace was too slow, we spent way too much time on certain material (sampling distribution and significance tests) and not enough on others (multi-variate regression). One strength of this is that it was very clear in expectations and instructions. Problem set grading could be improved by either describing on the actual problem set what was wrong or release problem set solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was designed well overall. However, perhaps there could've been more specific guidance about incorporating our textbook pages with the lectures. Moreover, I think section can be designed a bit better. Sometimes, we moved quite quickly through difficult material. Perhaps having more structured sections where students can do practice problems would be an improvement. Also, there seemed to be inconsistent grading for the problem sets, which was frustrating. I'm not sure if the Teaching Fellows used rubrics to grade, but that might improve consistency. The answer keys to the practice exams should also be improved. Some practice questions asked students to \"see lecture notes\" for answers...what if our lecture notes don't have the answer, not matter how diligent we are? If the goal was to have students figure out the answers themselves, then why provide an answer key in the first place? Also, there wasn't much clear feedback on the exams. Again, a detailed answer key would've been ideal. "

            "\u00a0If you want to take a statistics course, take this one. The problem sets are for the most part straightforward and you learn all the same skills you'd learn in a standard intro stats course, but in a smaller class environment where the professor is very passionate about teaching and makes every effort to get to know students by their first names. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it was great! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to learn statistics, this is an awesome introductory course. I didn't take stats in highschool, so I went into this course raw and did not find it too demanding. Professor Thomas is always available to answer questions after class and generally does not move on from a newly introduced topic until he has addressed all questions that students have. ",
            "\u00a0If JT is teaching the course, yes, you should take this if you are looking for a challenging but not super \"actual math\" heavy QR course or as an alternative to Intro Stats. JT works so hard to make this course and its naturally pretty dry material engaging and relevant. I, unlike many of the folks taking the class, did not need this course for GLBL requirements, I took it because I needed a QR credit and thought it would be particularly relevant as a PLSC major. First off, let me say that this being a \"math\" class shouldn't scare you off. The math utilized is quite basic, really just algebra and plugging things into equations. The difficult part of the course is the theoretical components. I would definitely say that the class is a lot of work- the psets take increasing amounts of time and the midterm/final are extensive and will challenge you. In particular, I'd say the last few weeks of the course are really when everything ramps up and it can get to be a lot. The course spends a lot of time on the introductory material and it often times seems like we really rushed through difficult concepts like regression analysis. But the light of this class really is JT. I can't emphasize how great he is in making the course engaging and interesting. His teaching style is fantastic and really loves working with his students. In short, if you're looking for a QR class that will push you and looking for an incredible professor, look no further than AQA. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's a straightforward course and JT is an great teacher who is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Not easy, but also not difficult.  JT is hilarious-- makes the lectures very enjoyable-- and his shticks keep you going through some boring material. Psets can be a pain but always straight-forward and if you go to most lectures and sections and the occasional office hours you'll do well. (Textbook readings unnecessary). Exams are both fair and ultimately you learn basic stats stuff that is actually useful - definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a stats and don't have to take Econometrics, I would highly recommend this course. JT is an excellent professor and he gives you the basics to pick up a study and understand all the stats inside without having to spend hours going over dry proofs. I enjoyed it, and it was not very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0yes--useful stuff ",
            "\u00a0For most students, this class is a requirement so you have to take it. Of the global requirements, this class is slightly less painful. The level of content isn't extremely difficult but the pace does pick up. When JT tells you that the material gets harder, HEED his word. It's an ok QR credit if you already have background in statistics. But just because the first two weeks are easy doesn't mean that it's an easy class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Stats are important and its an easy QR! Great professor, too! ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to learn about statistical analysis, this is your class. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not the most useful for someone in my situation, who's looking for a working understanding of statistics and a qr credit. Difficult to understand mathematical theory behind the concepts when the class only half covers it. psets are kind of fun, in the way puzzles can be, but doing calculations by hand often sucks up huge amounts of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to any student looking for a stats course that is interesting (as it has practical applications in the real world and we dealt with real life data). Moreover, JT is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Yale and made learning entertaining and worthwhile. ",

Some of the topics are difficult to master if you aren't very quantitative/haven't taken math or stats in a while, but Professor Thomas' lectures are really great and I found section to actually be very helpful for problem sets, unlike some other classes. The curve is generous and help is readily available. Problem sets can be time-consuming but are fairly manageable. I wish this had been my only p-set class so I could have put more time into them, but I got by okay. Take it if you need it, and rest assured that this is probably the best teaching around for the subject matter. ",

            "\u00a0This course is required for Global Affairs majors but also provides a good introduction to statistics for people like me with no background in the subject; I now feel much more confident evaluating research papers and understanding methods used and rationale for them ",
            "\u00a0Look, if you want to take a class with a good teacher and really understand the basics of how statistical analysis is possible then definitely take this class. But if youre looking to learn anything beyond t-tests and Linear Regression Models, you just wont get there in AQA. That being said, it is highly enjoyable, and Justin Thomas probably deserves a teaching award. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not strong on math or theoretical understanding take this course, otherwise I would recommend taking the intro stats class in the S&DS department which is more of a challenge and you likely learn more in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend this class to a student who wanted to focus on theory of introductory statistics. Indeed, this class was heavily based on understanding theory, which is helpful for developing a deeper understanding of statistics. The course load was manageable, but students should understand that some of the problem sets require many, many hours (sometimes upwards of 5) to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend for all social science students who think they dread stats. Prof. Thomas is an incredible instructor and knows how to convey knowledge so that non-math-y people will understand. The class is well structured, very informative, and tailored to the needs of Global Affairs, Political Science and other social science audience who needs stats as tools in research work. The workload is normal, if you go to lectures (which are great and I wholeheartedly recommend doing so) and do psets, you're fine. Problems revolve around actual interesting data and the class is overall very engaging and useful. Do it. "
