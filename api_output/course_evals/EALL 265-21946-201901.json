            "\u00a0A better understanding of the historical context of Japanese literature ",
            "\u00a0Various ideas featured in literary theory\r\nThe historical context in Japan after 1970 and a bit before as well\r\nThe different \"layers\" that construct a story/novel/work of literature ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me develop the skills to approach literature rigorously and attentively. I learned to think about the mechanisms of narrative and storytelling, especially in relation to the salient themes or experienced affect of the book. I think I read all books, in and out of class, differently now. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a diverse and thought provoking selection of Japanese literature after 1970, which itself was a new and educational area for me to read from. Furthermore, the literature gave complexity and breadth to my image of modern Japan as a society, and how certain stereotypes, ways of thinking, and modes of living may not always be true. I definitely developed more analytical lenses for studying literature in general, and more vocabulary and fluency with engaging with the texts. I also enjoyed getting to become more familiar with larger ideas and movements in literature in general through supplementary literary study readings as well as the teachers own insight, such as postmodernism, biotropes, neoliberalism, etc. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of Japanese Literature after 1970. We read A LOT of works in both fiction and poetry. ",
            "\u00a0definitely gave amazing insight into how to critically read and analyze texts, and in general was an amazing primer to japanese literature & by extension, modern japanese history ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze literature in translation, how to apply critical lenses to global works "

        [
            "\u00a0I feel like its difficult to have a good discussion in a section that large.  Most of the primary readings were fun and interesting to read (apart from red hair).  Some of the secondary readings were a little too dense to really understand though, and they were sort of ignored in class.  Feedback on our discussion posts would have been nice also since nobody ever seemed to respond to anything anyone else said. ",
            "\u00a0LOTS of reading.\r\nInstructor explained things exceedingly well and made class engaging.\r\nDiscussions were not always clear cut, which is both good as it let us explore many topics but also bad because sometimes we didn't know how to get the discussion going ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the supplementary material that contextualized the literature we read; along with Professor Poland's lectures and our discussions, these really helped me situate the works and their themes within larger systems and histories. I also appreciated Professor Poland's attention to how students were feeling and what we wanted to discusshe was always accommodating while also making sure we developed cohesive, substantive conversations. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was very strong; the progression backwards in time through a diverse and well-paced variety of works and supplementary readings felt well-thought out and effective. Because most of the works were assigned over the weekend, there was time to really engage with each text and then return each week with new ideas. Although the discussions in class moved freely and were overall interesting, I would have preferred if the professor had provided more structured, engaging, and even controversial questions that brought up the level of the class more. For example, although less related to the themes of the literature itself, one of our most engaging discussions was a spontaneous ranking of the works on a scale (like Dead Poets Society) of different metrics. ",
            "\u00a0It was great\r\nit was amazing Prof. Poland was amazing ",
            "\u00a0i think the discussion-based nature of the class was a double-edged sword  sometimes, discussion was great and it was fun to hear what classmates had thought of the readings; other times, id wished dr. poland would have just talked more about his own interpretations & knowledge of the novel/its author ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of supplementary reading, and I wish we had more time to discuss the main texts "

            "\u00a0Yes.  It's a lot of reading, but it's pretty easy reading as far as readings go.  The books are all pretty fun, and there is a lot to discuss in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very yes. Take this course if you like reading, if you're interested in modern East Asia, and if you're interested in literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I came into the class not particularly familiar with Japanese lit, but knowing that I wanted to take a literature course. I think regardless of your interest in specifically Japanese literature, this was a great class for anybody who likes to read, and wants to become more attentive readers. I learned to think more critically and seriously about literature beyond the plot, and I truly think the skills I developed will stay with me long after college. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, professor Poland cares a lot about his students and does a great job of teaching and helping students! He's definitely one of a kind and I would recommend this course to all students at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to any student interested in literature overall.  Japanese literature deals with ideas and themes that may be seen as uniquely Japanese and strange but are in fact very global. The course was well-structured, so although students took the course at their own pace, it was largely a guarantee that everyone read the literature, which itself was highly rewarding and well selected. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yesyeyssyysyseysy ",
            "\u00a0wholeheartedly! poland was an amazing instructor and frankly, this course was one of the best ive ever taken at yale or otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Poland is an excellent literature instructor and very passionate about the subject. You will develop new ways of analyzing text "
