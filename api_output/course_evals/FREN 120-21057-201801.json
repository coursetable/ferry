            "\u00a0This course does teach you a lot of French. I'm not sure that I'm sold on the French in Action methodthe workbook felt very much like busywork that I wasn't getting enough out of to justify the hours spent, and the videos were often just silly. Also, the FIA system meant that I learned a really random collection of vocabulary, including way to many car-related words, instead of vocab that would be actually helpful or applicable in most real-life interactions. Also, the weekly quizzes were way to much, stressful and not at all helpful, especially since we couldn't even keep the graded result. However, the course was really well-taught, and all the professors were friendly, approachable, and ready to help. Also, the in-class activities were greatthey really focused on speaking, which was helpful, and class was also a great time to clarify the trickier grammatical stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The workload and course design could use a lot of work.  It takes a large amount of time from the day. "

However, if you really want to learn French, this is a very good class. That is, if you aren't too upset about taking a B or even a C for a final grade. ",
            "\u00a0The good thing about this course is that you learn a ton of French. If that's worth a good amount of time to you, than you should take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- but only if they have a lot of time to devote to it and are very excited about the french language.  Or if they have experience with French. "
