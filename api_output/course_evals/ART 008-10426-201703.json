            "\u00a0i learned how to survive reading the densest, driest, academic texts ive ever had to read ",
            "\u00a0This class is listed as an art class, but the reality is that it is an aesthetic philosophy class that requires one to think critically about the intent behind different aesthetics. Through this class I was able to reexamine some of my favorite media and texts through the new lens of aesthetics and find new meaning in them. This class was also a very good introduction to writing college-level essays because they were our major assessments in the class and they grew progressively in length and difficulty. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate the relationship between aesthetics and morality from a theoretical yet applicable perspective. I also learned about the different, and often unexplored, aesthetic labels (e.g., kitsch, camp, grotesque, sublime) from a historical lens and how they can be found in both classic and modern artistic works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory (and application) of aesthetics. During the length of this course, I pondered on definitions of beauty, ugliness, the grotesque, the gothic, the uncanny, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0I had an excellent introduction to the aesthetics world, particularly in dark aesthetics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to look deeply into the many manifestations of the aesthetics we discussed in class as well as their cultural implications. "

            "\u00a0strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: extremely abstruse readings and discussions, more confusing than enlightening ",
            "\u00a0My favorite thing about this class was that it was a small seminar with a total of eight students (in my class). Because of that, it was very discussion based. Though our professor had a lesson plan and certain points he wanted to hit throughout his lecture, it was often guided by whatever input the students put in. As a result, the class was very engaging. \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses of the course is that there were was often quite a bit of reading, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but some of the readings didn't always pertain to what was discussed in class. Additionally, it would take quite some time for essays to be graded, which was a bit abnormal given that there were so few taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if we had delved into the social consequences of these aesthetic labels more since that was mentioned in the course description hence I expected a thorough discussion of that matter. However, there is a lot to be learned in this class, and it could really strengthen/qualify your viewpoints, criticisms, and knowledge of art in all its forms (i.e., music, books, photos, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class include the readings and the power point slide the teacher prepared for each course. The weakness of this class is also the readings; some of the readings (especially in the beginning) are incredibly dense. "

        [
            "\u00a0no, the professor was often extremely condescending and unreceptive to differing opinions and the content wasn't interesting enough to make up for that ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially in a fall semester. It is such a great introductory class to take at Yale because it fosters critical thinking, which is applicable in any field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you are majoring in art or have some interest in art and art history. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who are prepared to invest a lot of time into reading, researching, and preparing yourself for class. It is a big time investment. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved this course. It was fascinating and challenging, and the workload was not at all daunting. I would recommend this course to anyone who likes class discussions. "
