            "\u00a0The course organization is horrible and the professors don't teach well in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course's main strength is that the material is inherently interesting. However, it is really difficult to appreciate this because the class is exceedingly disorganized and hard to follow. Lectures don't always follow in a logical order, especially in the latter third of the course, where the first four lectures are each by a different professor, but more importantly, the content of each lecture follows circuitous routes to present the important information. A typical lecture chooses a topic and proceeds chronologically, listing out the researchers, experiments, and failed hypotheses that went into the current theory of a system's function. This organization leads to confusion on the part of the students because we will fall behind during the lecture, and by the time we arrive at the current thinking on the problem, we are not sure what is true and what has been disproven. This makes the lectures difficult to engage with and hard to synthesize information from. I did every assigned textbook reading and still struggled to understand lecture material, and this was in large part the reason.\r\n\r\nOne other strength of the class is the handouts the professors post on Canvas. These are much clearer than lectures and are better suited for learning purposes. If the class were structured more concretely around these handouts, there would almost certainly be less confusion in class.\r\n\r\nOne final component of the class I want to bring up is that there was very little feedback on our work in the class. Even once we had our grades on the midterms, there was very little information given on how they would translate to final grades at the end of the semester. The only information we were given was that if we performed better on the final, that would be weighted more heavily and that improvement was valued. There was no information on what the professors were aiming for in terms of grade distributions. This is somewhat understandable, as this is the first time the class was taught only to undergraduates, but it was still unsettling to go through the semester with no idea how we would end up doing in a course that is foundational to our majors. ",
            "\u00a0The journey that is NSCI320 can either be extremely rewarding or overwhelming. It is geared more towards people who have a strong background in biology and chemistry. The lectures are interesting, but the handouts are far more useful when learning the material and studying for exams. There are only three grades (2 midterms 25% each; final 50%). You have to keep up with the material as you go because there is too much to learn if you wait until the last minute to study for exams. There are also no psets so you really have to make an effort to study as you go. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: ?\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n-Lack of synergy between two instructors in regards to their teaching styles. It actually makes the course VERY difficult. I\r\n- Lack of communication between instructors and TA's which led to pointless review sessions\r\n-Lack of transparency with grading  \r\n- Lack of understanding from professors that a \"one hour test\" doesn't quite fit into a fifty minute course. \r\n- Lack of clear goals and expectations from professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course contains really interesting and actually just COOL information on the brain and the biology behind how we are able to function, move, talk, remember things, etc. It gives a deep background of the molecular basis. I think it was absolutely poorly taught though because it made me actually hate studying for the 3 exams given. We were not allowed any other opportunity to showcase our understanding of the material; no homework, laboratory reports, problem sets, etc. I felt it very unfair how the class was structured because it had previously been a graduate seminar and therefore, the professors did not teach the material to a level of understanding, especially for those with no previous background in this field or a physics course (that was not required but would have helped). The professors did not facilitate their teaching well jointly, I'm pretty sure the 2 main ones never told each other what they were teaching. I also think this made the exams more difficult since they each wrote their own questions and structured them verryyyy differently. When I was worried about my grade, they \"cared\" but really suggested I give up and drop the class rather than help me understand the material for the several times I visited them to get help. The peer tutor for the course was a better teacher in the material the days before an exam than the professors were for the entire semester, which just goes to show that the material was not impossible to understand but the professors made it harder for us to connect to the information or understand they explanations because they are better researchers in this field than teachers. The TA was not helpful in any way for the few times I went to her section, she only glazed over information necessary for the exams or to understand throughout the semester. This course also is required for the Neuroscience major which I think is not necessary because of the difficulty of the course AND perhaps the irrelevancy for many (including mine) fields in Neuroscience that are not related to Neurobiology. There was no feedback or any additional help in understanding the material, not to mention that the actual information was abstract and difficult to understand in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Really nice professors and AMAZING peer tutor. Huge improvement this year was that the course now is limited to just undergrads, making us feel more taken care of and that the course catered more to our needs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are many things about this course that much be addressed. One is the way the professors lecture. I did not like the style of writing on chalk board. There is a lot of biology here and it's hard to explain these topics using just a chalk board to draw out structures. The first half of the course with Forscher was better in drawing out more diagrams, but Haig often would just stand in front of class and not write anything and we would be left wondering what was important to write down and what wasn't. Also, Haig's handouts were just too much. It was not well organized, and felt like a textbook in and of itself. \r\n\r\nI did not like that the textbook assigned was once said by professors to not be well written. Why are we reading this book then if it doesn't clearly explain the same course content? I also did not like the exam style, especially Haig's. Having just essay questions and telling us we basically need to regurgitate every single fact we can think of to get full points (which is literally impossible) was not great. It made me feel like there wasn't much work that went into writing the exam, and I did not like that point breakdowns were determined by TA's. I often got no feedback on why I lost a third of points on an essay question. There also were 3 practice problem sets and after that, nothing. We NEED more practice questions so people know what to expect in the exam. I felt I left class everyday so confused. Sections were not helpful except for the first and third TA of the course who offered their wisdom of the area. This class would benefit from having three midterms where students can drop one. That or do not make the final cumulative, and just have three or four exams in class.There was hardly structure to this course. If this is to be a foundational course for the Neuroscience major, there needs to be a complete 180 flip. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very comprehensive. Problem sets or more quizzes might be useful to reinforce all the knowledge gained each class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is unorganized, and I think part of the reason is that it's taught by two professors. It was hard to find overarching themes of the course and often difficult to connect mechanisms that are actually very much related, simply because of the order and the way in which the lectures were structured. It was hard to piece out what information was important. Often during Haig's lectures, he would show detailed images of the brain and I wasn't sure what sort of information I was supposed to retain from it. Also the exams were very difficult and often the wording was confusing so it was unclear what concepts the question was trying to get at. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a valid survey of neurobiology but was difficult to engage with at times. I found that the division of the course between two instructors made it difficult to adjust to a second learning curve during the second third of the course. While the material was presented in a way that was easily understood, there was no focus on just how to prepare for the second-hour test. I would have appreciated example questions and answers to know just how far in depth we were required to answer. Overall, the course absolutely needs more crosstalk between the graduate TAs with the professors and between the professors themselves. ",
            "\u00a0You can really tell that this class is in transition from being a graduate to an undergraduate course. Topics are often presented with extreme detail, but it is never made clear how in-depth we should know them. There's honestly so much content that it's impossible to know it all - between the two professors and distinct thirds of the class, it really feels like 3 courses in 1. The content is definitely interesting though, which is probably the only reason I was able to try to study it all. \r\nAlso, it's supposed to be a 50-minute class. Be prepared for it to be at least a 60-minute class, that often starts up to 5 minutes early if Haig is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0I found the subject matter extremely interesting and engaging, and on the whole this class taught me more than most other classes I've taken at Yale. I also appreciated all the material posted on Canvas (notes packets to accompany every lecture, powerpoints, etc.), and I especially appreciated the peer tutor we had this year (Luke Newell). He was an incredible teacher, and he made all material that was confusing in class or in notes very easy to understand, answered any questions we had via email or 1-on-1 meetings, and in general made the subject matter much more accessible for students who came from a wide variety of bio/chem/physics backgrounds.\r\n\r\nI found the teaching of the class to be pretty disorganized, and apart from the material posted on Canvas, and the general organization of three Parts, there didn't seem to be much other organizational structures. I think I would have appreciated an overview of each of the three parts, and then also more time spent in class explaining how that day's material fit in with the larger picture of the class. For example, in Part 1, it would have been nice to start with a zoomed out picture of a neural synapse, and then go back into greater detail with each part of the process (generating action potential via Na/K channels, neurotransmitters release pathway, different types of neurotransmitter receptors, etc.), making sure to stop and explain how each part fits into the whole process. \r\n\r\nI would have also liked for the professors to explain what material was particularly important for exams and what was less so. For example, it was never explicitly told to us in what great detail we needed to memorize different circuits, (e.g. I memorized the crayfish sensitization pathway which I never had to reproduce) and I found myself memorizing every single term and pathway and circuit, and with the bulk of information we covered throughout the course, it became very overwhelming. Furthermore, there were certain topics (neural development) that we did not spend a lot of time covering in class, but that became 1/7 of the final exam, and I hadn't known to focus my time and attention on that particular topic. \r\n\r\nThus, I don't think the tests were very reflective of the relative time spent on different topics in lecture. And, more importantly, I don't think we were ever told what material had what level of importance, so we never knew how to study material or prepare for exams. \r\n\r\nIn the future, I hope the class does a better job of making the material more organized during lectures, and also explaining in greater detail what the expectations are for memorizing vs. understanding different circuits/pathways/drugs/topics when it came to tests. ",
            "\u00a0Concepts arent introduced in a very comprehensive way - as a group, we had a hard time cocneptualizing/visualizing where the processes we were learning about actually happened and how to use this knowledge to critically think about what weve learned. ",
            "\u00a0Regular worksheets and/or quizzes would be extremely helpful! Prof. Keshishians handouts are excellent materials, Prof. Forschers are ok. As the course is currently structured it is often difficult to assess your understanding of the material until youve taken and graded the test. Practice tests and keys might help with this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Some genuinely interesting material. If you put (way too much) time in, you can definitely feel like you've learned a lot. The third part of the course, in particular, was very interesting. The notes and sample questions provided from Prof. Forscher for the first third of the course. The TF (Luke) was fantastic, and his review sessions were really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Almost everything. Prof Forscher is a genuinely nice guy and gives good notes, but he's extremely disorganized and assumes way too much background Physics when explaining things which isn't relevant at all for the exams. Prof. Keshishian, on the other hand, definitely seemed more organized, but he never took time to explain topics too well, only really stood up in the front of the class and talked the entire time, never writing any notes of substance or slowing down. His notes were also just huge blocks of text and the midterm he made was hilariously vague and difficult. The TA's also varied so much in quality, with many of them not understanding the material too well themselves. The TA's would also criticize/question the Professors' teaching, but never show up to class and didn't know what to review. Overall, this course has so much potential but is often just an unpleasant mess. The final was especially cruel, with over 90% of the class working on it until the entire 3.5 hours were up, with very little to no time to spare. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the questions on the exam were not too clear. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of material mean that we learn a ton in this course, but it is also difficult to know what is relevant at times. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and fascinating. The course would benefit incredibly from regular homework/quiz style assessments which would help students gauge their understanding of the material and also allow them to keep on top of the course. These could be in forms of problem sets, or reading responses etc. Also having a more structured section would be very beneficial, and if homework is implemented, section could follow homework questions. ",
            "\u00a0The lecturers were too jam packed, not as clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in its intentions--presenting different levels of neurobiological examination, and illustrating large-scale biological principles with specific (and interesting!) examples. But it often failed in this endeavor, due to disorganized lectures and not enough connections between different units of the course. In addition, examinations were difficult and (in parts) poorly written, so it was hard to demonstrate knowledge beyond regurgitating material. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Only take this if you have to. The stuff you learn for the tests is really interesting but you have to teach yourself because going to class does not help at all. It's also just pure memorization for every test. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who loves the human brain and is willing to work hard to get the information they need out of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a deep understanding of the nervous system. There is no other undergraduate class like this (this class is very different and more bio/chem focused than NSCI160). Neuroscience majors have to take this classso buckle up, it'll be a ridebut worth it in the end. ",
            "\u00a0No. It really is not worth the stress. There is such a lack of clarity in this course. I really think it is time for NSCI and MCDB to take a good look at this course and see if it is really being taught in the most effective way possible. In fact, I'd actually CHALLENGE the DUS's to come sit in on a few lectures and see if they too are overwhelmed and lost by the incoherent lectures and fly-by speed of information of both Paul and Haig. My guess is they would fail. HK and PF just seem like they are not quite effective at TEACHING. They can talk, ramble and drone on past the 12:25 end point (every time). But they can't teach. There needs to be more feedback and more reviewing that is structured. (Or get new professors?) It is shame that so many other classes on campus at a similar level of rigor do not have this level of disorganization that NSCI320 is plagued by. Talk to Matt Simon/Michael Koel if you need help understanding how to CORRECTLY approach a two-instructor led course in the biological sciences that is difficult, challenging and complex but also approachable, understandable and FAIR. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not because it was poorly taught and had little to no help for students struggling or coming from poorly academically-prepared high schools. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it if you're not a neuro major or if you're not very interested in the brain. Too much memorization for a regular MCDB class, as I learned. Super fascinating if you're into the topic and I don't regret taking it since I loved the material, but be warned: you will spend many many hours memorizing every single possible detail, from molecules and isomers all the way up to brain anatomy. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not designed well. It is challenging content made worse by the lack of clear lectures. Sections are not helpful at all. If you need to take this course then do, but otherwise do NOT take it if you do not need to. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a handful. If you're a neuro major, you have to take it and all I can say is good luck. If you don't have to take this class, I might say shop something else. I would recommend taking this course near the end of your college career because it really ties in information from a lot of other classes - it's easier to understand the material if you've taken physics before. It's also helpful to have taken Human Brain and biochem before this course, but that's less crucial than physics. The material of the class is super interesting, however the course is a bit scrambled. The organization of the course is poor, which makes it difficult to piece big themes and concepts together. Often the lectures are super focused on one particular system and the professors forget to zoom out and give you context of what's even going on. If you take this class my advice is use the peer tutor. ",
            "\u00a0As it currently operates I would not recommend this course to another student until it is required for their major. The reality is that the way the course is taught, despite having incredibly interesting content, does not facilitate student learning in a constructive way - the students that ended up performing well in the course will simply have been the ones who are the best at memorizing massive amounts of content from the second two-thirds of the course. It's really a shame because I love neurobiology and ended up quite jaded. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, you're probably taking it because you have to with the Neuroscience major. I honestly enjoyed it overall, but it was really stressful with the amount of content and unclear expectations of the amount of detail we should know. I can't say I recommend it as any type of elective until I get my grade back and see how strong the curve was. Also, the suggested physics prereq almost scared me off, but I never felt that I was at any real disadvantage without having taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I found the actual subject matter really exciting and I thought this class was a really good culmination of basic biology, physics, and chemistry in a way that had a lot of applications to everyday life. I also found that we covered a lot of relatively newer research, so we knew what was known and still being studied in the field.\r\n\r\nI would also caution future students to keep up with the material and make very good use of the packets posted on Canvas. Furthermore, I found that the peer tutor was of immense help (even more so than the TAs were), and in the future I think that the class should continue to have a peer tutor (or multiple peer tutors) as a resource for students to use. ",
            "\u00a0Take if you are a neuroscience major and have to. Otherwise, no. ",
            "\u00a0If genuinely interested in neurobiology and willing to read and study a lot, yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you're not a Neuroscience major, in which case this is a requirement, absolutely not. It's a huge heartache that was always just a pain in the butt. I've always done well in STEM/Bio classes, but too often I felt completely lost with vary little resources to help out. The professors don't hold regular office hours - only saying to 'contact them' if you need to. The TA review sessions were also so mixed that it often left me even more confused. Some were great, others were truly confusing. Overall, if you have to take this course - which you likely do, really make it your priority during the semester otherwise it will be a struggle. The final exam, in particular, was truly awful and was the worst final exam I've experienced in three years. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want to learn about neurobiology, and who feel the need to understand how our brain/nervous system works on a more detailed level. However a good background knowledge in physics, chemistry, and basic biology would definitely help you get through the material much better - so this should be regarded as an advanced course. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested worth taking, but a lot of work and self teaching! ",
            "\u00a0You will likely take it to fulfill a requirement (hello, Neuroscience majors) and it is at times a fascinating deeper dive into the brain. But being in class is a frustrating experience, due to the disorganization of lectures and emphasis on seemingly-less-relevant material. My advice: in preparing for exams, read through each lecture handout (posted on Canvas) carefully and make notes combining its content and your lecture notes. Try to stay focused during class and find your points of interest--they might be different than you expected! "
