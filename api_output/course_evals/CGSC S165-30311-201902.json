I learned what consciousness is in Chalmers book and I also found my self a materialist through the process of studying and completing my essays about Chalmers Zombie Argument and the Defensible Materialism.

            "\u00a0Throughout the course, we discussed a lot about philosophy and psychology on consciousness. The course has given me a deeper insight on consciousness, further developed my understanding on supervenience. Additionally, the course introduced serval aspects of consciousness from neuroscience.

            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to further my understanding of topics in the philosophy of mind and gain insight into an area that I haven't studied previously  the cognitive science of consciousness. The course improved my academic reading and writing skills and taught me how to engage in philosophical debate. ",

            "\u00a0I would have preferred more small discussion groups, as these helped a lot when they did happen. I also think the paper prompts were a bit too narrow. Apart from this, the class was truly interesting and the material was well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very engaging. There were lots of discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher William makes fair and comprehensive explanations for each reading materials, which were quite difficult for me, that  we read before the class.\r\n\r\nI think maybe more conversations with students off class is needed, because for the office hours they are done by the TAs and it sometimes needs students to get familiar with the teacher assistant first. But the teacher assistant from the office hour really helped me with writing my essay. ",
            "\u00a0this course is intellectually challenging. it can be improved by having more interation. ",
            "\u00a0strength: the instructor encourages everyone to express his/her own idea. The instructor offered opposite views on the same problem and gave us freedom to make our own choice. ",
            "\u00a0The course was challenging for me, as I didn't have previous experience on the subject, and the class size of 30+ people certainly didn't help me to completely understand the content. I'd suggest splitting the class into two classrooms and having two different instructors for each class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, after taking this course, you become quite enlightened. The material covered is very comprehensive and lets you choose which theory you personally support. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a deep insight in the field of consciousness. However, the course is much more difficult than I was expecting. Although the course clearly do not have any prerequisite, it seems impossible to involve in discussions as a whole class. As I talked with some classmates, we were expecting the course will be taught with textbooks rather than a book of a personal argument. Additionally, we never quit have the time which \"we will spend the last half hour of class discussing how to research, plan, and write your assigned papers\" according to the syllabus. The course overall is complex and confusing, especially few people have background knowledge relative to the subject. However, the communication with TAs are not as efficient. The office hours and office locations were given after the first quiz, which we were not able to get help with professional knowledge. Having too much people in the class further reduces the individual's engagement. If the course can be more basic with fewer people and a bigger classroom, it will be much more effective. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the this course could address various different philosophical or scientific theories about consciousness within a short period of time, however, we could not dig really deep into the theories by having long discussions again due to the short time.\r\nOne weakness would be that the class was extremely large so that not everyone can engage in the discussions, or at least discuss in a comfortable manner. ",
            "\u00a0More breaks ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = Thorough insight into Chalmers work and taught at a level that was engaging both to students who had experience in this area of philosophy and to students who were new to the subject. In-depth feedback on assessment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses =  None regarding the teaching. Logistically, the room wasn't quite big enough for the size of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The professor didn't really do more than going through the chapters in the books, or the theory of consciousness. I think it would have been much better if  there were less of going over the readings, and more of discussing about the topics in the reading materials. When some discussion was made, it was only done  by a few students and they took up most of the class time. If we were in small groups to talk about things frequently, I believe more of the students would have had chances to talk. In the syllabus, professor had mentioned that there are no prerequisites in the class and he would help students in writing the papers, but there was almost no time in class to discuss about the papers. I had never written a philosophy paper before and it was very difficult to see if I am writing the paper properly. Even though there were TAs who had office hours, they didn't really know about what ideas were actually discussed in class. When I asked feedback about the mid-term paper, TA's explanation was hard to understand. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It is a well designed course. Even beginners in the field of philosophy can learn a lot about consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the ideas of consciousness discussed in the class should be explored. Especially to those who wish to have more intellectual engagement with themselves, this class is very beneficial. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot in this course. ",

            "\u00a0Only for student (not first year student) within the related major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student, especially who are interested in learning both the philosophical and the neurological aspect of consciousness since this course consists of those two EQUAL parts. (Some science students were overwhelmed by the amount of philosophy in the course at the beginning, which turns out fine)\r\nDespite so, the handouts were clear so that it facilitated understanding of the reading which may seem confusing to read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I felt like I learned a lot and it was accessible to me as someone who had never taken philosophy. Now I have had discussions with philosophy majors and am able to understand what they are saying and feel like I'm contributing to the conversation! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It was a very fun and rewarding course. I would recommend to both philosophy students and students from other disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to others if they have some background information about philosophy. The course focuses in the theory of David Chalmers about consciousness and in order to understand his idea, having background information regarding the mind-body problem and dualism is essential. The cognitive science part of this course was helpful, and if they are interested in the theories of what consciousness is, I believe this course will be helpful. "
