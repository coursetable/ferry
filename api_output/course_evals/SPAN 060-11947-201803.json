            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Spanish language literature. I improved my close-reading skills in Spanish and expanded my knowledge base regarding literature in general and Spanish language literature in particular. I also became more proficient at writing essays in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a broad exposure to Latin American and Iberian literary texts including poetry, short stories, novels, and plays. Developed skills in analysis of these texts from a literary standpoint and developed writing skills in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I really developed my skills in interpreting, analyzing and discussing literature in Spanish. As a class we really dove into each piece we read forcing me to think critically about what I was reading in another language. My writing in Spanish became much more sophisticated and I was able, over the semester to express more conceptual and deeper inner thoughts in Spanish.  I think overall oral production my Spanish language also improved due to in class participation but not as much as I would have hoped. However this was a literature course not a grammar course so this was not the direct goal of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Spanish literature by reading works from a wide variety of authors, genres, and countries. ",
            "\u00a0I gained significant knowledge about Spanish and Latin American literature, including poetry, novels, short stories, and theater. Many of the works were related, and as a class, we were able to draw connections between topics throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Writing and reading ",
            "\u00a0It allowed me to develop my analytical skills of literature and poetry. It gave me insight into the context in which all the stories, plays and poems we studied were written. Finally, I developed a better written expression in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills in Spanish. Before this course, I had never written an essay in Spanish, but by the end I was able to write a full research essay. I learned about the progression of not only Spanish literature but also literature in general. It also gave me insights into the different literary movements that motivated some of the best authors in the Spanish language. All told, I enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of the semester I learned to become a better academic writer in Spanish and clarify my thoughts in order to present a concise and cohesive analytical argument about a piece of literature or poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to communicate an argument more clearly in Spanish, and my writing organization improved. I also learned much more about literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more comfortable expressing my thoughts about literature using Spanish in academic discussion and writing. The course allowed me to familiarize myself with a broad range of literature, and to practice writing essays in Spanish. "

            "\u00a0The class was very interesting, and all of the readings were well chosen. The teacher made sure to keep us engaged however she could, and the class discussions were usually very interesting. The poetry unit felt like it lasted a little long, and we could have spent more time on theater, as the analysis of \"Bodas de Sangre\" at the end of the year was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the works we read are incredibly interesting and compelling, readings and papers are pretty manageable and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the students taking this class are native speakers and this class places no emphasis whatsoever on improving Spanish language/speaking skills, so even if you scored a 5 on the AP Spanish Language test it may be difficult at times to fully participate without a firm grasp of Spanish speaking (and listening) skills. Just a warning, though I still highly encourage anyone to put in a little extra work and to take the class ",
            "\u00a0Course has great class participation, great leadership in discussion by the professor and contained a great selection of works. The only two things that were at times taxing was the fact that I was one of the few non native speakers in the class which made it feel hard to keep up especially in discussion, and the very fast pace at some points of the course reading. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good way to get exposure to a variety of Spanish literature forms and to practice written and oral analysis skills. The reading assignments were often dense and took a long time. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fun class that is both a challenge in language and in studying literature. It could be improved by having small group discussions that give students the chance to work through ideas before sharing in Spanish. This would be especially helpful for those who do not have Spanish as their first language. Going more in depth into fewer works could potentially benefit the course. ",
            "\u00a0I found that a few of the readings were not as interesting, but the vast majority of the readings assigned were fascinating (e.g. Lorca, feminist poetry). Class discussions were one of the best parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved if there were more discussion on the expectations for the writing assignments. It is a first year course and students come with many different levels of preparation. The essays were almost never discussed in class, and I think it hurt my understanding of what the expectations were at times. ",
            "\u00a0I like that this class was taught similar to an English 114 course, but it was conducted completely in Spanish. I think this works particularly well for native speakers who need to better their academic writing and speaking skills so they can perform at a university level. Some of the prompts where difficult to address because their was too much material that couldn't be effectively covered in three pages. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course, in my opinion, is the material covered and Profesor Valis' approach to literature. Additionally, the short writing assignments were really helpful in making me engage closely with the texts and develop my own thoughts about them, as well as allowing me to practice writing in Spanish. The longer research paper at the end of the term was definitely quite a challenge, but it was very rewarding, as it was an opportunity to delve deeper into the texts I have enjoyed the most, and to learn more about them through research, while also forcing me to think creatively. \r\nThe weakness of the course was that class discussion was sometimes unanimated  since it was easy for students to stop paying attention in class.

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. I learned a great deal, and it was a very enjoyable course overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for someone with a relatively firm grasp of the Spanish language and a deep interest in literature. The class period is longer than a regular 50 minute lecture (about an hour and 20 minutes I believe) and the vast majority of this is just discussion, so it helps to be interested and invested. This is not really a class where you can get away with not doing the reading (or at least knowing what it's about), but it's a rewarding class. You get out exactly what you put in since the dynamic of the class as a whole as well as how much people engage and participate can determine whether it's your favorite class or your least favorite. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are interested in studying literature in Spanish. If this is not their interest however, it would be very difficult to get through the course just for the sake of getting a spanish credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is prepared to dedicate a significant amount of time to readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students who enjoy reading Spanish literature and who enjoy literary discussions. Overall, it was a fun class and a good way to fulfill the language requirement with only first-year classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material assigned was interesting and the class discussions were very insightful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to have a survey of Spanish literature and its history. However, I would not recommend it to someone who wants to focus on a specific author or time period. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course especially to students who have taken AP Spanish Literature in high school as this class will expand on the themes of the high school course but demand more on depth essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in Spanish literature and want to improve both their written and spoken Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with a range of literature in Spanish, or anyone looking to improve their writing in Spanish. "
