            "\u00a0Knowledge of matters relating to the Silk Road broadly speaking. Also general skills useful for an academic (e.g., writing strategies, presenting at a conference). ",

            "\u00a0I have learned how to use different kinds of materials to make an academic argument,  and I learned the history of Northwest China, various races, nations, artifacts, religions, economic activities along the silk road from the 3-4th century to the 13th century. \r\n\r\nI learned how to study different social groups, and how to deduce a reasonable conclusion with different kinds of materials. I also realized the importance of examining the original materials instead of their digital photos. \r\n\r\nThis course gave me a broad perspective of Central Asia's history, and different religions in the silk road also raise a lot of question that to be solved by future scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a working knowledge of the various troves of excavated documents in the so-called \"Silk Road\" region. I also learned how historians (especially social historians) analyze and draw conclusions from these documents. "

            "\u00a0Few weaknesses. Having two faculty members with different areas of specialization was especially helpful for a seminar such as this one, which surveyed various disciplines, topics, and regions. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall its a great course: especially like how assignments were arranged throughout the semester so we didnt feel overwhelmed by end of semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  a deliberately planned schedule, and excellent lectures of scholars from other universities, valuable experience to go to the library to see the original woods,  readings and challenging discussions in class, language partners. topics of different fields.  \r\nWeakness:  hope we have more cross-discipline dialogues, then we students from different fields can learn from each other. ",
            "\u00a0Because there were two instructors, at times there were miscommunications or conflicting instructions. But the two instructors each offered valuable and different insights to the material, so I appreciated having both. It could just be a little better organized ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0The workload was very uneven. Sometimes all we had was some relatively light reading. Other times, we had multiple fairly involved assignments in addition to some light reading. At the end of the course, nearly all of the students seem to have been excused from revising their papers. I personally think my paper could have used some mandatory revision, and nearly all of my peers' papers could as well. I'm not sure how the student(s) who did have to revise their papers were chosen; if anything, the quality of their papers seemed above average for the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. For anyone wanting to take a pre-modern history course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is really interesting and challenging. I learned a lot from this course and improved my understanding of academic studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially because Prof. Hansen is such an expert in her fieldit is not to be missed. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in pre-modern China or Central Asia, as well as the various religious groups: Buddhism, Manicheism, Zoroastrianism, etc. The class essentially ends with the advent of Islam in the region, so it would not necessarily be as useful for someone studying Islam.
