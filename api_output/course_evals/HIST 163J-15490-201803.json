            "\u00a0I developed better research skills, an increased ability to interrogate and question the histories of the civil rights movement and black activism that I had learned prior to taking this course, and an incredible amount of knowledge about the era of Jim Crow within the context of World War II and the Cold War. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze primary sources with a careful eye and see how the relationship between the rise of fascism in the 20th century is similar to Jim Crow in the U.S. and the rise of fascist governments in modern times. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the United States' avoidance of dealing with racism while fighting against racism overseas. Lots of hypocrisy there. I also learned about Germany, Black soldiers in Germany, and too much more to relate. Great seminar with a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about fascism as it intersects with Jim Crow, became a stronger historical writer especially in my use of primary sources, and thought really deeply and carefully about minority identity, how America fits into a continuing legacy of fascism, and how to be political in our current historical moment. ",
            "\u00a0We learn about Jim Crow America in a broader global movement contexts. It's interesting to see the many critical and historical events that were happening around the world simultaneously. We also learned how to work with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0- How to analyze primary documents, and complement them with historians and academics' theories and analysis.\r\n- How to contextualize global history and domestic history, by putting the two into conversation and better understanding the implications of both on each other's respective conditions.\r\n- How language such as \"fascism\" can be used in wide contexts, and still hold great weight and accuracy. \r\n- How to better understand different historians' ways of writing, and discover which style I like best.\r\n- A deeper grasp on the longer civil rights movement, and the groundwork for the work that is often more discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to study history with a greater degree of nuance and detail than ever before. I learned how to construct strong original arguments without flattening a given historical topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course unveiled a whole new part of American and world history to me. It looks at the fighters who often go unrecognized in the mainstream discussions of civil rights and human rights, and examines their efforts in the context of a multi-national historical period. It taught me not just about this history, but also about writing about and analyzing primary sources, people, and moments. ",
            "\u00a0In Professor Duensing's course I learned invaluable skills of primary resource analysis, creative historical writing, and engaging in productive dialogue using many different types of sources. I learned about pivotal events and figures in the twentieth century in the anti-fascist movement in both Europe and it's reverberations in the U.S.. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding not only of the civil rights movement but also of the numerous forces that shaped fascism abroad and anti-fascism at home, as well as the idea of a black international consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, you get a detailed look into the connection between anti-fascism and anti-racism between the 1930's and the early 1970's, focusing primarily on the period between the 30's and just after world war two. You'll get good feedback on your writing, and the readings and discussions help build a base of knowledge on an essential but often forgotten chapter in US history. In addition to learning about the intersections of anti-fascism and anti-racism, you also get a lot of information about the US radical left, and another take on the US socio-political landscape either side of the second world war.

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were certainly the instructor, who provided a safe space for conversation and discussion on topics ranging from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to Angela Davis, the other participants who were willing to discuss the material in a thorough and interested manner and who pushed the conversation in new and interesting directions, and the course material which was incredible insightful and was chosen, clearly, with intention. The only small weakness I can think of is that sometimes it seemed as if the conversation were dominated by a few, potentially having the effect of discouraging quieter voices from participating. That being said, those who participated often very much added a depth and breadth to the conversation that wouldn't have been there otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: so much amazing material that really made you think and really engaged the entire class. Really intense stuff, too, that just makes you realize how racist this country is.\r\nWeaknesses: almost too much material? Readings were really long and dense and hard to talk about in class if you didn't have outside knowledge. But still a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and consequent class discussions were a total strength. Anna chose the readings super carefully such that the load was never too heavy and there was a clear direction for class discussion. The work I did always felt meaningful, and I knew that Anna was ten times as invested in the course as all of us put together, so I felt supported and motivated to work thoughtfully. One weakness that might have been unavoidable is that the same few people tended to dominate class discussion. Never in a rude or domineering way, but it still tended to silence people including myself that felt less comfortable speaking up. Maybe we could have had more exercises to intentionally include everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Selection of readings, that made a logical progression through history.\r\n- Anna's careful realization of when readings or concepts were harder to grasp, which thus lead to a thorough breakdown of the material. This then lead to an ever better discussion of the material.\r\n- Carefully selected group of students from different backgrounds that greatly fostered intriguing discussions and (positively) unpredictable input. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- Some students, including myself, gave input more often which could be seen as positive or negative. However, it would be great to hear other students' input more. The opener segments try to do this, but I think that they could be more engaging so that students are actively listening to one another during their discussion openers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great discussions and a high level of depth in the study- given how incredibly niche the course was. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings were so extensive that the limited class time meant certain topics were not addressed- this is common to many seminars though ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the short primary source writing assignments. They were not only fun, but Annas feedback was constructive and writing them was such great practice for history!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely well organized in a way to both understand the material and allow students to grow. Anna was a tremendous professor, instructor, and listener, and the other students in the class made each session a new academic adventure and challenge. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are really in the student's interest. Without the full participation and excitement of my peers, this course would not have been as gratifying and rich as it was. Duensing was, of course, to thank for the level of engagement, and she was an incredible discussion lead. Whenever we were a bit lost and had trouble connecting the often disparate sources we were assigned for a unit, she was able to aid us to a greater understanding of the connections without being to heavy handed. I think that she was also really great at incorporating all the different types of voices and perspectives in our class, which is a skill I think is rare at a university like Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely informative and the readings were very insightful. I'm not sure exactly how but I sometimes wish the discussions were a little more lively-sometimes it would create a situation in which three to four students were sort of talking specifically to each other. I feel like that situation is more a case of students not doing the required reading more than anything. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only did I become a better student from this course, with the opportunity to analyze primary sources and discuss academic readings in a way that I hadn't before, but the subject material of this class is also incredibly interesting and something I never would have encountered had I not taken this class. I don't really know what else to say other than I learned so much in this class, and I also really appreciated how I was able to connect concepts in this class to other courses I was taking during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If Anna is ever able to teach this again, I absolutely recommend it 100%. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. Anna Duensing is truly a wonderful person and a great teacher who really knows how to workshop writing. She's wonderful. The subject matter is fascinating. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anna is one of the most wonderful professors I've had at this entire university--she truly set the tone for this deeply engaging, important, timely course. You will want to learn, and you will undoubtedly learn a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It gives a great foundation to understand what fascism is in multiple contexts, especially in our current age of Trump. I would take it again if I could. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Anna is an amazing instructor, and the material is so relevant and so critical!! ",
            "\u00a0This course expanded my understanding of American history, of justice, and of the struggle of oppressed people. This material should be mandatory reading in an effort to understand our own time. It is taught extremely well and allows you to grow as a person and learn as a student in a deeply thoughtful manner. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those who are interested in improving their essay writing. I honestly shifted to being a history major because of this course and Duensing's instruction. It was extremely engaging, and taught me a lot about the ability to tell emotionally engaging histories that remain true and just. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly-I think people often reduce black america in the 20th century to a small, very linear narrative that through this class is shown to be far larger and complex. ",
            "\u00a0If I'm being honest I was somewhat hesitant about taking an af-am course with a white grad student to begin with, but the readings and theme seemed exciting and I needed a writing credit. I have rarely been more completely and utterly wrong about a course in my life, it is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Unfortunately, this class will likely never be offered again, but in the off chance that it is, TAKE THIS COURSE. It is extremely rich, information dense, and recovers many pieces of history people wouldn't even know to look for, let alone know exist. Despite their relative obscurity, the topics studied in this class are crucial to the history of the US and the world as a whole, especially at a time when we are being forced to recognize with the question of fascism in the US once again.
