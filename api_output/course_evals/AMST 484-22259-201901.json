            "\u00a0I had no previous exposure to photo-theory before, and so this was a thorough and exciting exposure to different theories of family photography. I learned to think  about memory and memory recording/creating differently. We also had several incredible speakers who made me think about the photography in art, family, and the maintenance of the state. ",
            "\u00a0The class offered my first exposure to photography as a subject of critical theory, which greatly expanded my conception of the way that cameras and photographs operate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at photographs in a way unlike any looking I had ever done before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to really consider family photography as an crucial field within visual culture. So much of public history can be found in individual, private family albums, and their interaction with the wider social narrative. "

        [
            "\u00a0The reading list is spectacular and Professor Wexler is brilliant. The structure of the class felt extremely self-motivated (as in, there was little follow up to many of the readings and no assignments besides the final project and paper) and I think this hurt the class dynamic, and also meant that students could have been pushed further with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible syllabus, knowledgable and passionate professor, wonderful guest speakers, good lectures ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and highly enriching. It is a little disorganized in terms of accessing assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had read Barthes!  And in general, I wished we had spent more time in the archivesor at least that it could have been more integrated into what we read for the class. "

        [
            "\u00a0The subject matter of the course was incredibly engaging, moving, and thought-provoking. Each class spoke to a different and fascinating aspect of family photography, and it was a particular benefit to have so many guest speakers visit and share their work with us. I would definitely recommend the course to another student interested in the course and willing to engage with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is super interesting and I really recommended especially if you are interested in family photography/amateur photography in general ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I learned so much in this class, not only academic material but I was also able to analyze my own family album in relation to the material and readings we covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Wexler feels the material so deeplyand she helped me feel it, too. "
