            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the title authors of course, and about the subsequent debates in the literature regarding their arguments. I think I basically see some of the main ways one can critique the views involved. I got to practice some longer form philosophical writing as well. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have take the prerequisite course in early modern philosophy. I had not taken it and found myself a bit lost when discussing how the philosophies of Hume and Reid related to Locke, Berkeley, etc. That said, the material turned out to be far more interesting than I initially thought. I really enjoyed reading Hume in particular. ",
            "\u00a0Solid philosophy seminar.  Winkler is an incredibly kind, supportive professor and is very knowledgeable about everything he teaches.  The course was pretty low stress, with only a 5-7 page midterm essay and 15-20 page (for undergrads) final paper that can build off the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This is an interesting class with good readings and good discussion. Its pretty focused on the given authors, so if the debates they engaged in are not of interest there isnt much else. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to other philosophy students ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. I wasnt particularly interested in Hume or Reid going in, but Im glad I spent the semester studying them. Professor Winkler is an extremely good discussion leader: he lets students pursue a line of argument as long as is productive, and steps in to move the conversation along as soon as things start running in circles. I would recommend taking this course regardless of your interest in the topic. A well-led seminar on a less interesting topic is almost always better than a poorly-led seminar on the most interesting topic, and Professor Winkler leads the best seminars I have found at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Any class with Ken Winkler is worth taking if you're at all interested in the material. He's a very good teacher. "
