            "\u00a0Professor Kamens and Professor Yiengpruksawans EALL 506 Japans Classics in Text and Image truly augmented and sophisticated students knowledge and understanding of Japanese literature and the cultural, literary and artistic consequences of each of the literary works presented in the course. This course enabled students to practice interdisciplinary and intertextual analyses of Japanese literature and art in a clear, step-by-step manner, in which students were encouraged to place texts and images in conversation with each other, to analyze texts within images and/or images within texts and to consider texts as images themselves and/or images as texts themselves. Furthermore, Professor Kamens comprehensive explications encouraged students to perceive and conceptualize a particular literary work from various perspectives and in consideration of its historical, sociocultural and artistic contexts. Also, Professor Yiengpruksawans extensive explanations recommended students multifaceted consideration of Japanese art in tandem with Japanese literature, especially in terms of how the said work is interpreted and received by its audiences.

            "\u00a0This course comprehensively introduced students to Japanese literature and art and diversified their perception towards these cultural works, via its interdisciplinary and intertextual approach. The combination between discussions of literary works and object studies of Japanese works of art co-constructed students knowledge and perspectives in a multifaceted manner, since students were able to compare and contrast works of literature and art concerning a particular theme, for instance. Furthermore, this courses incorporation of Japanese poems within its readings and their calligraphic representations within its object studies concretized the notion of text as image and image as text, thereby augmenting its students analytical experience of Japanese literature and art. Additionally, this courses incorporation of the Yale University Art Gallerys Scattered and Gathered: Perspectives on the Tekagami-j, a Japanese Calligraphy Album exhibition fostered and augmented students individually developing their own literary and analytical perspectives towards Japanese literature and art.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to others, since its students will be introduced to Japanese literature and art in an innovative, interactive and dynamic manner, via reading diverse texts of Japanese literature and analyzing various forms of Japanese art. This courses very juxtaposition of Japanese literature and art builds and fortifies students abilities to perceive and analyze a particular work of literature and/or art from various perspectives and contexts. Also, this courses combining such varied teaching methods as class discussions, object studies and individual presentations at the Gallery itself presents students with a multidimensional and diversified conceptualization of each work of Japanese literature and/or art and gives students extensive opportunities to practice different modes of literary and artistic analyses. Thus, this course greatly augments students literary, artistic and analytical understanding of Japanese literature and art. "
