I felt that each member of the class was asked to contribute each week, which made it more interesting to engage with the material. I also enjoyed the geographic diversity of the course content. Regarding aspects that could be improved, I occasionally thought that it would have been nice to integrate use of more primary sources into our readings and meetings. It would have also been useful to discuss the transposition and influx of Islam into the Americas. "

For any student with an interest in Islamic history, I would recommend that they take this course in order to contextualize the religion and its fascinating historical nuances by various civilizations. In my own understanding, this course has done wonders in disillusioning the idea of the Muslim archetype by revealing how the uptaking of Islam is thoroughly intertwined with contextual politics, culture, language, etc. "
