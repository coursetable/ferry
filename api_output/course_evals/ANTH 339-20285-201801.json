            "\u00a0I was exposed to a lot of urban ethnographies of Asia.  I learned the basic theories of the field.  In the end, I was able to write my own! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze good ethnographies as well as notice things and think like an ethnographer. I also learned a lot of critical thinking skills and got better at expressing my opinions during discussions. I further developed my ability to structure an argument and became a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0You go through one ethnography a week pertaining to a city in Asia and you discuss its strengths and weaknesses both in terms of content and in terms of its structure. You really learn a lot about different cities in Asia from the perspectives of lived experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a wide range of contemporary social issues across Asia and also gained knowledge regarding how to write a convincing ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write engagingly and orderly. Also learned a  lot of interesting facts about asian cities through class readings. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great chance to reflect on ethnographic writing, particularly in book-length works, to see which strategies are effective and which aren't. I became much more aware of methodology and how to choose a worthwhile subject, too, as a consequence of discussing the many different authors' own styles and choices. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0As someone who had never been exposed to anthropology or ethnography, I felt the books we read were pretty amazing.  Some better than others, but all worth reading at least parts of.  The professor does a great job of guiding the students through how to read an ethnography and then how to write one.  He is also very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class! The reading load is high but I do believe this is necessary. I think that a decent amount of class time was wasted on reading the book reviews we wrote, and would have appreciated cutting down that time in favor of more discussion. The class discussions were provocative and interesting, although I wish we spent a little more time talking about cities and less time talking about ethnographies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Go through a lot of material, and Professor Harms devotes a lot of time to improving your writing, which I think is a rare feature in most classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. The readings were engaging, and class discussions were thought provoking. I appreciated that every student had to write a book review for one week. This assignment forced every student to engage with the course and allowed different people to contribute at different times. I cannot think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings selected are awesome, a very thorough introduction to Asian cities. \r\nweakness: I suggest increasing discussion time to 3 hours, because 2 hours of seminar really don't cover enough of one book, and the class discussion turns out to be a little bit all over the place when you want to squeeze all the discussion into 2 hours. "

            "\u00a0Yes.  Only take this course if you're willing to read the books, because that is the main content.  Anyway they are very interesting reads!  All the writing assignments were painless (two very short ones, and one final paper). ",
            "\u00a0This course really changed the way I think about writing. Discussions pushed me to critique the books we read and conduct deep analysis on the themes we were discussing. The papers, although not ethnographies, aided in this by forcing me to develop really strong theses and arguments. The workload is really high, though, as you have to read a book a week. A few of the books are pretty hard to get through, but most were really good and so it didn't feel like doing work. Overall this is exactly what I think a seminar should be. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. if youre into urban studies then ethnography is an essential approach to peering into the lives of its residents that quantitative data cant necessarily give. Professor Harms is a gem of a professor and pays a lot of attention not just to content but in crafting your actual essays (in some ways, your own ethnography). ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Harms does a great job leading discussion and every sing reading is meaningful in dissimilar ways. This course is the only seminar I have taken at Yale in which I have felt that the 1 hour 45 minute class time is inadequate to cover everything that students want to discuss. Take this class if you are interested in ethnography, Asian history, or Asian society. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to students who are interested in writing and hope to improve their writing. I wouldn't recommend it to students who are just hear to learn about interesting facts about asian cities, because the focus of this class is really how to write good ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-social-sciences major, I gained so much understanding of ethnographic methods from this course, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a SC credit or just the familiarity needed to approach this kind of literature. Professor Harms was energetic and friendly, and along with all the genuinely engaged students, he made the class something to look forward to. "
