Most people enroll in 120 as a requirement for a prospective major or as a prerequisite for higher level science courses. Not falling into either of these categories, I thought 120 was a genuinely good course. A lot of people complain about it as being impossible, and it has a terrible reputation, but remember that a lot of people who bemoan the workload, pace, and material arent really interested in learning the material for its own sake. If you are genuinely interested in math, this is a challenging but rewarding course that will teach you a lot! ",
