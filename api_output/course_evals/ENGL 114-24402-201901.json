            "\u00a0The anatomy of an argument, and how to clarify its written presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I can confidently say that this course made me a better writer. After reading my first essay for this course I can clearly see the strifes Ive made. Having a small group of classmates also made the learning environment more intimate and personable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate texts for their effectiveness in making their argument and then how to use those techniques in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped to teach the basics of argumentative essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0My reading comprehension and essay writing skills definitely improved in this course. I also improved my academic discussion skills. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Rigorous, interesting text selection, very rewarding to spot improvement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion stagnated with lack of student participation. Not really a weakness of the course itself, but this detracted from my enjoyment. ",
            "\u00a0I received lots of feedback for all of my writing which contributed greatly to my progress. Sometimes the overlapping essay assignments became overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0There were times a lot of the readings led to class discussions where people felt the need to fill up silence with thoughts that were not necessarily productive contributions, so more guidance at times may be helpful. The peer feedback system worked really well to help see our writing from another perspective. I also really appreciated the professor-student conferences to discuss my own concerns about my writing in a private setting and how to improve. ",
            "\u00a0At times this class did not feel like an English class, but rather a religion class. A large portion of the class was spent discussing religious readings. I wish that more class time had been invested in teaching the fundamentals of argumentative essay writing, considering it was essays that dictated our ultimate grade. "

            "\u00a0Yes. For the purpose of improving ones writing, this is a very efficient course. In only one semester, you write four essays in 3/4 styles with genuine feedback from your professor, all the while furthering your understanding of a select topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a challenge, but if you intend to strengthen your writing, it is one worth undergoing. Also, because the class size is small, you have a greater chance at making friends within your class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course helped me develop my skills as a writer and understand other people's perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this course if you are genuinely interested in the subject matter. If you are simply trying to get a writing credit, please know that there are much easier classes through which to do so. That being said, the class is interesting, especially if you are not well exposed to religion and want to learn more about it. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if they were serious about improving their writing. It's definitely not a gut course for STEM majors wanting an english credit. "
