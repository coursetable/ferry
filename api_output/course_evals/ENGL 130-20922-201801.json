            "\u00a0This course really taught me how to read analytically and pick out the intricacies of the text through close readings. I also improved my writing a lot, as I now have deeper and more arguable claims and learned to pick and use evidence effectively to prove my point. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. I learned a lot about what an epic was in general which was really interesting because I'd never been exposed to the genre before. I learned how to close read really well, improve my writing with essays, and speculate about big ideas and characters. I definitely gained a lot of insight into the worlds of the books that we read. ",
            "\u00a0We delved deep into a variety of works, classics that certainly enriched my semester. There was a clear narrative starting from the Odyssey, through Inferno and ending with Ulysses. I think my writing also improved greatly as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about what it means to be an epic, and how this form of literature evolved over time, as well as the specifics of each time period and setting of the novels that we read. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to transition from understanding literature at a high-school level to developing my thoughts on literature at the collegiate level and had a glimpse of what literary scholarship would look like. ",
            "\u00a0I developed close reading skills, writing skills, and knowledge about the transition between the genre of the epic to the genre of the novel. Although there is not much emphasis on the actual writing parts during class time, you are able to schedule office hours to go over your writing, and even go to residential college writing tutors and peer writing partners. ",
            "\u00a0Great class about Western epic. How to connect broad themes in Western lit. ",
            "\u00a0English 130 provides students with a crucial understanding of giants of the canon. The continuous theme of \"epic\" through Western Literature extends into the present, and this course shows students through readings, literature, and essay writing the continued relevance of such a theme. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill of the analysis of big ideas within these epics, rather than solely focusing on close readings. Furthermore, this class allowed me to develop essay-writing skills since I had to generate essays on massive epics with a narrow focus and make it cohere. ",
            "\u00a0Literary trajectory of epic -> novel ",
            "\u00a0More organized writing. Better analysis of ideas portrayed through the epic. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was strong because all the texts follow the common theme of the transition from an epic to a novel and it was interesting to see it come full circle when the novel pushed to the breaking point starts to develop into a story of a community and thus is like an epic. The structure of the course really allows us to get more from the text, as during discussions we learn things that we would not have thought of if we just read the books on our own. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was great honestly. The reading can be a lot, but that's pretty unavoidable. ",
            "\u00a0The works we did were exceptionally good and our discussions were largely fruitful. However, Middlemarch and Ulysses seemed a bit less accessible to me and so I think at least one of them should be replaced. Moreover, given their length, there is no practical way one can actually fully keep up with the reading. Perhaps tackling them sectionally and skipping over redundancies like we did in Don Quixote or choosing a less verbose work would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the novels were so dense that there was always something interesting to talk about in class\r\nWeaknesses- because we were reading these novels so quickly, and each one had so much to say, I inevitably found myself wanting to learn more about one book before having to start on a next one. ",
            "\u00a0One strength in this course is the syllabus of books you read: you begin with some of the most famous epics, and then you move into novels that model the epic. It trains you to learn what an epic really means, and it shows the chronology of the epic (into the eventual novel). One weakness in this course is the pace: you have to read a lot in a short period of time. Be sure to stay ahead of the readings, as it is easy to fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, and Professor Lindskog is fantastic. In class discussions were fun and judgement-free, and the class fostered a deeper understanding of some of the great works in the western canon. Professor Lindskog also gave personalized feedback on all three papers. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class definitely include the syllabus. The readings themselves are hefty, but they flow very well together and are expertly curated. Professor Lindskog was another serious strength of the class. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that we go through so many incredible texts and focus on the moments that are really important to us personally and to the overall understanding of the literature, allowing us to really power through but still get something out of it. I think discussions are also really rewarding, because the epics make you think of bigger ideas than just the literature, but also about your own understanding of yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Sort of felt like going back to high school in that the way we discussed history was very broad and not super nuanced. Maybe this is because it was a class intended for freshmen.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the writing assignments and assigned readings but sometimes found the class discussions very tedious to sit through. Maybe this is more a reflection of my interests than the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Ulysses was an excellent book to cover. Perhaps one less book would enable a less rushed covering of epics across time. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are like me, where I love reading but never really have the time to do it. This class will force you to read a lot but it is really interesting material and you really learn a lot about everything from the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. It has been my favorite class at Yale so far. I thought the books were incredibly interesting, and even if you weren't fond of them you still learned to appreciate them through the discussions in class. The papers were really interesting in that you could really write about whatever you wanted and you were passionate about, and you get great feedback. You also get a lot of background on the authors, big ideas, and what's going on in the time period which is enriching when reading the books. Discussion in class was great, and I always looked forward to it. Professor Kindskog was incredible; she always brought up really interesting discussion topics, listened to all of the students, and she really goes above and beyond to help you improve. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Really important to learn these sorts of works and unlike Directed Studies, I think you have a chance to really reflect well on their importance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who wanted to read some classics of the Western canon. DS lite, if you will. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, as it is a very interesting course. However, go into this course with the mindset to learn, not to earn a grade: you will not get a lot out of this class if you are only reading and writing papers for a grade. Also, take the initiative and go to office hours with the professor (Professor Lindskog is always willing to help), go to residential college writing tutors, and the Center for Teaching and Learning peer writing partners: these resources are invaluable for any writing class. Also, be sure to participate actively, as that will be an even better way to enjoy the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, and Professor Lindskog is fantastic. In class discussions were fun and judgement-free, and the class fostered a deeper understanding of some of the great works in the western canon. Professor Lindskog also gave personalized feedback for all three papers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to both English majors and those without a background in literature. Having a strong base of knowledge in these texts would serve everyone well, particularly those with an interest in further English or literature studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it gives you a rich background in European epics in a single semester, and you simultaneously also develop your essay writing skills along the way. My only hesitation would be that it is really hard to catch up on readings for a single text if you fall behind, since you power through a single text (like Don Quixote, for instance) in a matter of two weeks. Nonetheless, the class is still incredibly rewarding and stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was pretty broad, which could be a good thing, but also might not be if you have read some of the texts before. Given this, it might be better to take a class that is more focused in scope.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a lot of reading, which you should be aware of. ",
            "\u00a0Well worth it to understand well-known works. "
