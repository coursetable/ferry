            "\u00a0It is an amazing course that brought me to think of many aspects that I have not thought before, or at least not in an integrated way.  I learned different ways to approach a problem and learned to study a problem in a broader scope as a systematic scope. I learned more about the current regulations and roles of different stakeholders. Also, the course brought me a positive attitude towards the tough problems currently out there. ",
            "\u00a0The idea of a systems thinking approach was helpful but if anything, just a seed was planted. The course lacked the discussion of learning the framework (also is there anything beyond Donnella Meadows?) and applying the perspectives we were hearing from guest speakers. Instead, this process was left as GROUP WORK (which has an entirely different set of challenges compounded  by attempting to learn the framework, formulate one's perspective and then advocate for that perspective with a group that lacked cohesion or trust because the work up until that point had been individual). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make causal loop diagrams, conduct multi-criteria decision analysis, and think in systems! I learned so much. It has really changed the way that I think about problems and I think it will be immensely valuable to me in the future. In particular, it challenged me to think about SOLUTIONS rather than just environmental problems. This is not something you typically learn how to do in environmental courses, and I think we need much more of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about a problem within a larger system and from a variety of perspectives. Since this semester focused on toxic chemicals, I have a deeper appreciation for green chemistry solutions and am much more aware of potentially hazardous chemicals in consumer products. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped develop my critical thinking skills. It was my first introduction to systems thinking and causal loop diagrams, and it was helpful to have to come up with these analyses on our own for the final paper.\r\n\r\nI also developed skills in writing briefing papers. The three page limit per paper was useful in helping me think about what the most important points were and how to highlight those points.\r\n\r\nThe guest lecturers were also a highlight. It was very interesting to have different people come into class with different perspectives. The opportunity to have lunch with the speakers was a great benefit. ",

I learned just how complex those problems can be, with multiple stakeholders and their conflicting views, and how scientific consensus can be influenced by external factors. Learning about causal loop diagrams was also super useful, something I would like to apply to future problems. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: depth of knowledge of professors, who really care about the material and the class. TAs were also helpful and frequently available to meet outside of class. I particularly appreciated that the course forces students to think from multiple perspectives, develop skills in writing briefing papers, and think about solutions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class seemed a little disorganized at times - and sometimes we were inundated with Canvas announcements. But relative to the strengths, these are minor points. ",

The lectures and class discussions were phenomenal, and the order of the briefing papers made a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThis might be hard to do (due to scheduling issues), but there were a few speakers that came that said things that would have been interesting to think about for briefing papers that were already submitted. It would be nice if there were someway to go back and add those things somewhere during the course instead of sitting on our thoughts until the final paper.\r\n\r\nIt also would have been interesting to have more time for class discussion. We had a lot of speakers and I think only one full class session to unpack everything that we heard.\r\n\r\nOne more small thing - it would have been helpful to have office hour scheduling/times available sooner. ",
            "\u00a0Not enough guidance on the papers. Rubrics would be helpful. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - very passionate professors, influencing speakers including one that was brilliant yet controversial (important for real world challenges) and heavy class engagement. All of this was very helpful to also keep up with current environmental events.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - writing briefing papers is not as simple as it seems. There should be more training time to do this (at least one or part of a class that breaks down an example brief). The TAs were great, but sometimes their thoughts didn't align with what the professors wanted us to focus on in our papers. I would have also loved to learn more about solutions/the process of creating them after class discussions (those typically took up a lot of time so I understand that there wasn't much time left for that). ",

            "\u00a0Other than the very heavy workload, I have no complaints. The instructors are outstanding, the course content was germane and interesting, and the speakers perfectly complemented the course content. This course should truly be required for all students completing an MEM program. It's so critical to instill a systems thinking approach to problem solving in future environmental leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the amount of work and research required to write the briefing papers forced me to engage with the course and learn a ton about the chemical system broadly and my chemical, generally. I felt way more engaged with this course than others. I thought the guest lectures were all really interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - We spent most of the semester looking at each aspect of the system but not how they worked together. I think there could have been more time dedicated to that, mainly in the form of thinking of solutions and writing our final paper. It was a huge last-week push to write that, and I think it could have been higher quality if we had had about 2 or 3 weeks. I also think the guest speakers could have better represented the system if they had spoken on the same day and had a panel discussion with us in class. ",
            "\u00a0One of then biggest strengths of the course is the systems thinking approach. It was interesting to look at the chemical from the policy, technology, communications etc. perspectives. However, it would be even more interesting to prepare similar briefings on the chemical for the decision-makers not only in policy but also in industry and NGOs. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed receiving a detailed feedback on each of my papers - it helped to look at the chemical from a different point of view and identify the gaps. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the guest speakers - some of the lunch conversations were really inspiring and enlightening. However, the abundance of the guest speakers could not substitute the need to get a more specific knowledge on how the FDA, EPA and other governmental agencies interact and work. These questions emerged once we started to work on our final paper - it seemed quite difficult to come of with the feasible recommendations without solid understanding of these basic facts and interrelations.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if more attention was given to the format of the briefing paper that can be actually presented to the EPA or FDA. I find it to be a very important detail that could make the course much more applicable to reality. ",
            "\u00a0Smaller class, more clarity between TA's and professor, having such a large number of themes reduces some level of discussion about the topics, more focus in SD and less about the topic (Chemical) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great organization, engaging lecturers and guest speakers, project-based, relevant, engaging, good assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: started out a bit slow. Don't learn about other chemicals/student groups until the very end, which ends up being only a 15 min pres. ",
            "\u00a0The professors were extremely engaged and passionate about the topics, it was extremely exciting to go to class. The lecturers were very interesting and brought their insight from different stakeholder positions.\r\nDuring the semester we did a deep analysis of the problems surrounding our chemical, however we did not dive into solutions or recommendations until the last paper. It would have been useful to have more time to elaborate the final paper and be able to analyze alternatives. Regarding the feedback received from the papers, the level of detail received was very different from one paper to the other; even between group members we received different recommendations regarding for example citation, format and content, and this generated confusion. During the semester it was difficult to have a clear understanding of what was expected in the papers and how they were graded. ",
            "\u00a0Guest speakers were great, assignments were intense but useful for learning ",
            "\u00a0The professors were deeply engaged and engaging. The assignments were relevant, had clear expectations, and helped build valuable skills. The introductions to systems thinking at the start of the course were fascinating. It was exciting to have so many prominent spokespeople come into class, but it also felt difficult to integrate learnings from then since we had so few opportunities to discuss them as a class. When we did discuss, it was in a large group. I think it would be helpful to create smaller discussion groups of students to discuss the speakers and how they relate to our topic and systems thinking approach. Additionally, I think we could have had fewer speakers, and had more time at the end of the semester to work on our projects with our groups. ",
            "\u00a0Well structured and implemented! Nothing should change. \r\nGroup work should however be encouraged at the start of classes. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers were really interesting, but comprised nearly half of the class time that I felt could have been used for class discussion or more in-depth lectures about systems thinking. I think a panel session with a couple of the guest speakers interacting together would have been much more useful, than hearing each of them in isolation, as this would be a better representation of how stakeholders interact in the real world and would have opened up more class sessions for other activities. \r\n\r\nI felt expectations for final projects/presentations were poorly communicated, and students were not given benefit of the doubt for the miscommunication by professors/TAs. Final presentations during reading period was never identified in the syllabus, and was mentioned only briefly during class during the week that many students were away for the COP conference. ",
            "\u00a0I really valued the guest lecturers and thought it was cool to hear from people across the spectrum of perspectives. That said, a lot of class time was dedicated to guest lectures and, as a result, I felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the systems thinking skills learned during the first few weeks of class, the guest lectures, and the final white paper. I would have liked more time practicing and developing the systems skills before having to dive back into them after a couple of months for the white paper. It wasn't entirely clear how they fit back in with the briefing papers we had been writing, and it seemed like more time could have been spent on prepping for the white paper and linking the class components together. I thought the teaching team was really great! Feedback and standards seemed to differ at times from one TA or Professor to the other--perhaps consistency in grading could have been improved. Communication became a little rough at the end of the semester with unclear deadlines and expectations for the final paper and presentation, but for entirety of the semester up until that point, communication was clear and effective. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and felt like I learned a lot. ",

Lectures).\r\n\r\nIt also wasn't clear to the class or on the syllabus that there would be presentations at the end of the semester. This should be made clear at the beginning of the semester so students are able to plan effectively. ",

The transition from independent briefing papers to group work and synthesis was a bit rocky and rushed. It would have been helpful to start that process a bit earlier, or with clearer understandings of what was expected of us. Perhaps an encouragement or requirement to share findings and understandings during group check-ins once or twice during the semester? My group started many interesting discussions regarding our system that we weren't able to fully explore or resolve due to time constraints at the end of the semester. ",
