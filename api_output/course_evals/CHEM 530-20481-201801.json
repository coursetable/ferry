            "\u00a0Strengths: Material was very interesting, and Professor Batista presented the material in a way to keep us interested. Lecture notes were good, assignments were not too time consuming but effective in helping to learn.\r\n\r\nWeakness: At times lectures could be disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course content was interesting and relevant. I felt that the assignments were useful, especially the computational ones. The exams were sometimes too difficult/long to complete in the allotted time. In particular, the second exam was longer than I would be able to complete in 75 minutes, even if I knew all of the content perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0The information conveyed is very important for my work. The course could improve by having assignments spread out throughout the course. The middle and beginning had very few assignments to test our understanding of the material. ",

This was particularly problematic in the beginning of the semester. He also had his students create assignments. I think the course contains important material, though. ",
