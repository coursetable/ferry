We had finished Calc II by the end of October and moved on to analyzing stability of differential equations with linear algebra and some other relatively arcane (to me) techniques. Definitely very interesting material, especially with its applications to population modeling and other systems, but often very abstract. ",

In addition, the class also covered phase planes and beginning linear algebra (Jacobean matrices, eigenvalues/vectors). I was able to analyze the math within biological papers as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely implanted a deeper understandings of the cross-sections of theory (math) with practice (science). I've been able to better understand the papers and research covered in other classes, which in all aided me in cementing the concepts! ",

These skills will be very useful if I pursue higher education in math or physics, or for research in general. A brief introduction to Linear Algebra was included. ",

            "\u00a0Going into the class, I was a little worried about having to read and analyze the math models on scientific articles. However, I am really happy that this was one component of the class. Now I am much more confident with academic articles in general and I feel that I am better equipped to understand mathematical formulas. Overall, I really enjoyed the biological application. Initially it made problems and topics more difficult, since there was a biological layer added to the math that had to be understood. However, after comprehending the biology/science, it was easier to understand/do the math. ",

I developed the ability to connect mathematical representations with scientific and dynamical significance. ",
            "\u00a0MATH 116 was a very extensive introduction to the basic mathematics needed for mathematical modeling in the biosciences. Although it is introduced as a Calculus II course with a focus on modeling, I would argue that the focus of the class is not Calculus II material. The class started with an introduction into differential equations and then moved on to series, integrals, differential equation systems, linear algebra topics, and even some topics that are supposed to be covered on a Calculus III, like MATH 120. This great accumulation of topics was intellectually stimulating, and useful for acquiring a sense of modeling of biological systems. Overall, the class allowed me to have a holistic understanding of mathematical modeling in relation to the biosciences, while it introduced me to the various topics that were of significance to a Calculus II class. The challenging nature of the problem sets allowed me to use my critical thinking extensively, and prompted me to spend more time solving problems in mathematics, something that certainly helped me with developing my problem-solving skills.

            "\u00a0Strengths: There were some very interesting topics tied to the math\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the math was so difficult to understand that it was impossible to attempt to tie it to anything. This class might be covering too wide of a breadth of applications of calculus to biology. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that a lot is covered and from the start the application of math to biology and real life was emphasized. Another strength is that there were a lot of opportunities to get help if I was confused even though the course was more fast paced and challenging than 115. A weakness could be that not enough journal articles were explored. Perhaps it would be cool for Professor Hall to attach several articles per each topic even if we only really focus on one. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class is that the topics and readings are very interesting, in my opinion. I also liked that the topics we learned connected to biology.\r\nOne major weakness of the class is that it does not have a textbook since the class was created by the professor, so you can only rely on lecture, course notes, and the peer tutor for extra help. ",
            "\u00a0John Hall is a great professor and this is a pretty great class. Some weaknesses include some answer keys that lack explanation or justification in some problems. Strengths are psets and lectures that engage the student with the material. ",
            "\u00a0It kind of throws you for a loop, starting with seemingly simple calculus and jumping right into differential equations and systems of differential equation. It's very easy to get swamped and lost in abstract math that you apply without necessarily understanding the heart of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was tough, no doubt. Grueling psets, difficult concepts, very hard exams and practice questions. However, through this struggle, I have learned an unparalleled amount of techniques and information. This class was an absolute monster and an absolute delight! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is John Hall. He is an amazing professor and the reason you should take this course. He's very willing to help out his students and he is clearly brilliant. One of the weaknesses was the fact that there wasn't always a ton of opportunities to practice your skills outside of the weekly psets; because much of this course is somewhat alternative, it's not like you can go to Khan Academy and practice modeling. There doesn't necessarily need to be a textbook written, but maybe a greater store of practice worksheets for the latter half of the course would be helpful when just trying to get a better grasp of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course notes provided are very helpful, as are the readings which help us connect class lessons to real life situations. I feel the class could benefit from having one more peer tutor ",
            "\u00a0I think more time could be spent in class going over the logic behind approaching problems, especially because the type of thinking required for this type of math was very different from anything I had ever experienced, and I could have used more practice encountering potential test questions rather than just understanding the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I think a definite strength was our instructor's engagement with his students. It was helpful to have someone who knew our progress in the class individually and offered many opportunities to ask questions. However, I felt that some concepts covered in this course did not fall under the domain of second-year calculus. For example, we covered linear algebra concepts and multivariable calculus concepts, but not thoroughly enough to understand all of their implications. We only covered these concepts in a cursory manner so that we could understand the equations presented in papers. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and peer tutor were both very helpful if the student had any questions. In addition, the professor covered the topics in a clear manner, and the problem sets, albeit difficult, were effective in helping us actually use the math we learned. Another strength is that course notes and various practice tests are posted online, and both are very helpful. One weakness is that it's difficult to understand the readings without going over the course notes or coming to review sessions, and that sometimes the readings are quite technical. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an incredible job at introducing a more cross-disciplinary approach to the problems we individually hope to tackle. I think that's one of the biggest benefits to taking this class, and its really unfortunate there aren't many others like it. The weakness in this course was addressed in a midterm evaluation, and I felt it greatly improved. I had felt that the material needed to do the problem sets assigned had not fully been cemented in class before the due date. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Omg, John Hall is great. You learn so much and are definitely challenged. You see math in a whole new lens and it's super cool tbh. I think the skills learned will serve me well later on, in STEM and outside of it. The exams are well organized and doing the practices will give you a good idea of how the actual exam will be.\r\n\r\nWeakness: You don't need to have a strong background/foundation beforehand, but I would recommend it. The class can move a bit fast and it's easy to get lost when you can't grasp a concept in time. Also, very confusing concepts will be tossed at you when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nDO NOT TAKE THIS if you aren't expecting a challenge. Go do Math 115 if you don't want a challenge. Take this class to learn. Take it to broaden your horizons. I loved it and would recommend to others, but not for the faint of heart. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: an extremely beneficial course to those interested in the biosciences (particularly biomedical sciences), taught effectively in an organized manner, interesting material, challenging in its incorporation of advanced math even in an intro math course, focus on application than memorization or regurgitation\r\nWeaknesses: difficult in that it requires students to understand complicated biological studies involving math topics, though these studies were later broken down in detail by professor which helped understanding ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor hall is a great teacher, even if he does go through the concepts very quickly. The course notes are also very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the concepts are not explained in the clearest ways so it can be difficult to understand a concept just from class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is one that makes sense. I really enjoy the content covered and I feel like everything connects in such a way that makes it easy to understand. I really enjoyed the readings and how they can be connected to the topics we learn in class. However, I feel like the class tries to cover too much which can slightly hurt the coverage of material at the very end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: smaller class size; everything that we learned had a purpose and was utilized for mathematical modeling \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nIf some of the class notes could be made more thorough such as the one on basins of attraction because we do not have a textbook that we could reference to understand this new concept but other class notes were in that respect ",
            "\u00a0The course is very effective in making sure the students learn and apply the subject material but it felt as if I needed to go to peer tutoring in order to even attempt understanding of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the class made it very difficult to follow and to connect concepts as a course, because more often than not concepts felt very scattered and confusing in relation to one another. I understand the need to include calculus II concepts because it is listed as a MATH 115 alternative, but putting all of those concepts on the problem sets and barely touching them in class is a very inefficient and stressful way of covering them. Having to teach oneself on a graded assignment puts a significant amount of stress on the student to get things right on their own the first time around, even with help of peer tutors, rather than actively learning from the instructor. This assignments-as-teaching format also puts inappropriate stress on peer tutors to teach concepts to students, which is unfair to both the students and the peer tutor because the tutor should not need to introduce/teach full concepts to students and the students should not have to rely so heavily on peer tutors who can be not very good at explaining things. Beyond this, learning linear algebra and differential equations material was somewhat bizarre because I felt rather unprepared for that material and it wasn't taught in a well-rounded way - this course ultimately is not a linear algebra or differential equations course, and the disproportionate stress placed on these areas was confusing and stressful. I also thought that Professor Hall has a very fast-paced way of teaching that is often difficult to follow simply because of the speed; particularly with unfamiliar non-calc II concepts, I think I certainly would have benefited from a somewhat gentler pace. I do not feel like I took a Calc II course but rather a course on 8 bioscience mathematical modelling articles. Did I learn things? Yes. But I do not believe the course was taught very efficiently. It felt like there was a significant amount of legwork that I personally had to do to even keep up with easier concepts in the course, and I think this could definitely be improved overall by taking a step back and trying to create a more cohesive course, perhaps with less emphasis on the articles and more of an emphasis on that cohesion. I also think that the course notes could be more involved in terms of worked examples and things such as that. Sometimes in-class examples can be confusing or notes taken are unclear and I think I would have benefited from being able to look through the course notes, our \"textbook\", and see at least a few different kinds of worked examples rather than mainly verbal explanation of the abstract concepts in question. To this end, more integration of Michael Frame's textbook may be helpful - even just referencing a few pages in that text every so often in the course notes to give helpful examples would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0It is a well-taught course, but it has very little resources (no textbook and only one peer tutor). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course involved the wide range of math and biological applications of math to which we were exposed. The course material went well beyond AP calculus, which allowed me to learn a lot more than what I did in high school. In addition, the chance to read scientific literature, and then carefully dissect it in class, gave me the experience and skills necessary to read papers in the future. The subject matter of the course was also very interesting and relatable. A weakness of the course may be the fast-pace which was necessary to cover such a breadth of material. Perhaps meeting more than twice a week or having a discussion section may have given us some more time to practice the skills and concepts before moving on to another subject. Additionally, I think some extra practice problems on top of the problem sets would have helped solidify the concepts taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0The class notes and practice quizzes/tests are incredibly helpful. I really like that every class always begins with a warm-up that leads into the topic of that day. I also find it fascinating how the topics of the readings tie into the math in the lectures. Most, if not all, of the material is well presented and thoroughly thought out. However, some biological/scientific examples given in class to present certain math topics are a little advanced and difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that it covers the necessary calculus concepts in an engaging, applicable way. It is well organized and taught, with helpful office hours and reasonable problem sets. One weakness was the necessary inclusion of irrelevant (and challenging) topics, such as Taylor and power series, but I'm not sure if that can be modified since the course is equivalent to 115. ",
            "\u00a0This class is interesting, and engaging, and its small size is one of its biggest strengths. Professor Hall is a very passionate and approachable professor, and his teaching is a strength for the class. Although the course has a clear aim to make mathematics appealing to an audience of students with a biological academic affiliation, and wants to facilitate mathematical learning in the sense of modeling, I felt that this course was perplexing and incoherent in various ways, and hence it may have caused the student not to gain the maximum of the intellectual wealth that it had to offer. Going into this course, I expected to get acquainted with the various topics that a Calculus II class normally covers. Nonetheless, this course did not do exactly that; it rushed through topics such as integration, because it considered them to be prerequisites, something that was definitely not reflected neither on the placement exam site nor on the syllabus. I expected this course to be challenging and I was very excited about its modeling aspect and the topics that we were going to cover in relation to the biosciences. Many of my expectations were fulfilled, as the course walked us through various biological systems and their modeling aspects and prompted us to connect mathematics to real life scenarios. However, the nature of the course made it difficult for me to thoroughly understand the concepts covered. \r\nThe course crammed a lot of material in a short amount of time and that resulted in a superficial review of the material covered. It is clear for me that it is not possible to cover both the entire topics of MATH 115 and introduce topics in linear algebra and linearization all in a semester-long course. I came out of the class thinking that it was interesting with a clear aim; nonetheless, I felt that a strong background in mathematics was needed before somebody started bringing modeling into play. Furthermore, the readings were another aspect of the class that I was very excited about, but turned out to be perplexing and vaguely connected to what we were taught. Although the readings may have been interesting for an audience that had taken years of calculus, and engaged deeply with the biological concepts presented, I feel that they were not suitable for students that were just being introduced to some fundamental aspects of calculus and biological, mathematical modeling. The concepts that were covered in the readings and the systems of equations that we were called to deal with were far more complicated that the basic concepts that we were taught in class, and that made the readings difficult to follow at various instances. I hold the conviction that this class should be addressed only to students who possess a strong background in calculus and especially integration. The readings are for me a part of the course that does not significantly add to the intellectual experience, and may even be proven to be confusing rather than helpful. All these are not to say that the class was not good; I just believe that it was not suitable for me and for many people that did not have a strong background in calculus. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-taught compared to other math courses I've shopped at Yale. The notes and lecturing are very helpful. The peer tutor was also a great resource. Review sessions were productive and helpful. Honestly, this course probably had more strengths than weaknesses. The lecture outlines put on canvas could have been more in-depth to help reviewing. Another weakness is that the only two examinations are the mid term and the final, which doesn't leave a lot of room to improve grades if one exam doesn't go so well. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Compared to the other math courses at Yale, yes. This is a class where most students actually have not seen this type of math before. Professor Hall is also an excellent professor who really cares about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this class is a rare opportunity to learn about how math is actually relevant in the world which does not come often in lower level math or math classes in general. Additionally, I was really lucky that this class was smaller than most offered and here, taught by a really good professor, and not a flipped classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you are interested in the intersection of math and biology/life sciences. This is not a regular math class where you just learn equations and plug in numbers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you learn WHY you are learning what you are learning in addition to having a pretty great support network. The course notes are very helpful and the readings helped introduce me to scientific literature. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not... it's definitely a lot, especially when you don't get credit for the more advance mathematical concepts you have to learn. It's definitely interesting stuff though! I'd say take it at a time when you won't be overwhelmed with a lot of other stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You will learn so much and gain such a greater appreciation for the biological phenomena that we see around us, as well as for the mathematical connections one can draw from and between them. It is indeed a very difficult course, no doubt, but you get out what you put into the course; you will likely not be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over Math 115 with a bit of a caveat: they are not the same. Math 116 is much harder material and requires you to think on a different intellectual level. If you just want to get your QR credit or prereq done, you should probably take Math 115 because 116 moves way beyond normal Calc II topics into diff eq/linear algebra material, which makes the homework often very hard and strenuous. However, it's worth it in the end because I feel like I learned a ton in this class. John Hall is amazing, and a definite benefit over Math 115 where you may get a bad TA/section; he's always there for his students. The peer tutor was also INCREDIBLE. So there are lots of opportunities to get help in this class, which is good because you will likely need it. The material was also very interesting and this was one of those classes that really changed the way I looked at a lot of biological concepts. Overall, definitely worth taking if you have the passion/drive to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is more engaging and interesting than a general mathematics course. Seeing the applications of the maths rather than just learning the math is a much more enriching experience. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless they were both pre-med and interested in challenging themselves in math. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. From what I've heard, 116 requires much more effort than 115, but it was worth it. You will interact with your peers very often and build a close-knit community inside the classroom. Also, the professor is incredible and will not hesitate to spend time with you to help you understand the topic and answer any questions. This was my most difficult class this semester, but also the most rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0If you are truly interested in STEM research, I strongly encourage you to take this class. It's a challenging course, but if you don't think in numbers, it's a very accessible class (not a tense lecture environment, professor and ta/peer tutors are friendly and encouraging etc) that will help develop a foundation to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they were on a pre med track ",
            "\u00a0YES ... if you want to learn! But not for the faint of heart. You'll learn math in a much more interesting fashion, but prepare to be challenged!\r\n\r\nJohn Hall moves kind of fast, but will definitely try to help you with anything you need! Peer tutoring hours are also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Though the material was challenging at first, if you stick with it, ask questions, work with others in the class to complete psets, and really engage with material being taught in lectures, you will come out of the semester as a much more competent math student. I feel so ready to tackle higher level math courses at Yale if I want to, and feel confident in my understanding of applications of math in the field of biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you really enjoy math. Would not recommend for anyone taking math for a requirement or just to brush up on calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is an awesome course and acts as an amazing alternative to MATH 115. Although the \"biology\" part of the course may throw some people off, in reality this course is really just a much different version of 115 that covers differential equations in a lot more depth. I think anyone considering taking 115 should also shop this course just to try it out. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is taught well and you learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to take learn applied calculus and are interested in biology. ",
            "\u00a0In the way this course was taught to me, I would never recommend this course to another student. There were interesting aspects to it in terms of the mathematical modelling of biological processes but the way it was taught overall made it extremely difficult for me as a learner. I think perhaps in part due to my preferences as a student to learn through spoken explanation, having to do so much legwork on significantly harder problems on problem sets to teach myself concepts and get it right the first time, for the grade, was frankly unfair. I certainly don't ask to be spoonfed or guided to the right answers every time but the course relied so heavily on the problem sets to introduce new concepts that it was largely impossible to complete them without significant outside help. Having a peer tutor teach students new concepts under the guise of helping with problem sets or having to teach oneself said new concepts on one's own is frankly ridiculous, and I would not want to subject anyone to that level of stress. In all honesty, it is a hard course; for the majority of people who might take this course, which are (prospective) biology-related majors who often only need 1 credit of higher-level math as a prerequisite, it is simply not worth the struggling and self-teaching to take this class over MATH 115. ",
            "\u00a0No, it's really hard to get help if your schedule is busy because there are so little resources. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. We not only covered a wide variety of math topics, but we also learned a lot about biological modelling, a skill that will be important for research. Due to this, the course was super interesting and exciting. John Hall is a great teacher who cares about his students and wants them to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It is very challenging (the most challenging course I took this semester), but it is well structured and you have all the tools necessary to do well. You just need to put in the time. The psets are challenging and I would definitely recommend working with peers to make sure you do not commit silly mistakes that cost a lot of points. The difficulty of the psets prepares you for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to fulfill a calculus requirement and don't want to repeat the straightforward elements of BC calculus, you should definitely consider this class! It's challenging but very interesting, and the math actually means something. ",
            "\u00a0If one is interested in thoroughly walking through the Calculus II topics, and gaining a complete understanding of mathematics rather than mathematics in relation to modeling, I would suggest that maybe this class is not for them. As I mentioned above, this class is not very good at thoroughly introducing the topics covered in a typical Calculus II class and it definitely lacks in a cohesive structure. The topics that are introduced in the course may be proven overwhelming for a student that has not previously taken a Calculus II class in high school. Therefore, I would recommend this class to somebody who wishes to challenge themselves academically and is very passionate about connecting mathematical modeling with the biosciences; however, I would not recommend this class for somebody that wants to comprehensively walk through the topics of a typical Calculus II class and has a weak background in that area. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. For a pre-med student or a student interested in bio-sciences, I think this course is much more useful and a better use of time than MATH 115. However, I had some experience with Calculus II before taking this course, so I would recommend that students with no such experience take 115 rather than 116 to get a better grasp on the basics. "
