This improvement would make it much easier to study the course content, and digest the more difficult material.

I think many of the students would have preferred it if we had used, for example, Python as our base language instead of R. I would also have liked practice with a language like Python that's more widely used in industry. But overall, the course was a good one, a first taste of the power of ML. ",

I know it's hard to have class engagement with such a large class size and there is a lot of material to go through, but sometimes pauses for questions or asking a question for the class to answer with long enough pauses for thought could help.

Certainly inspires me to take future courses in machine learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: both too much depth at times and not enough depth in others. For example,  often we would see some of the math behind the algorithms we worked with, but typically blitzed through such information, giving me very little to remember now. Similarly, we spent only a class or two on any given algorithm, giving us a basic understanding of each, but lacking some true conceptual understanding. ",

This class is billed as an \"applied\" class. However, the first questions on the homework were infallibly not \"applied\" questions. These questions were very theory-based in a way that was difficult but did not help me understand the techniques they applied to. In this regard, I found them to be largely a waste of time in that they cut into the time I could devote to the rest of the homework that tended to be more applied. I understand that given the size of class, it may not be feasible to have more in-depth student-driven projects, but this would have been most helpful to me. To illustrate, the applied homework problems tended to include instructions to clean and manipulate the data, with little instruction on how one would actually grapple with this for the given data mining/machine learning technique. Overall, given that this is an applied survey course, I would de-emphasize the under-the-hood mathematics (as important as they are) in both the lectures and the homework and use that time to focus on intuition and applications of these techniques.
