            "\u00a0This class taught math-based ways to analytically assess music of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, especially regarding rhythm and pitch. Although these theoretical processes are relatively new and encourage the student to set aside more traditional types of analyses, I think my understanding of music theory is increased greatly by taking this class, and my math skills have increased marginally. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking abstractly about mathematical concepts in music ",
            "\u00a0Generally speaking you learn how to think about music from a mathematical, systematic perspective - at times a perspective that is geared towards helping you understand music in cool new ways, and at others one that feels like theory for theories sake. \r\nYou get exposed to some very well crafted tools, graphs, theories, terminology that may open your mind to new ways of conceptualizing music. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new way of thinking about pitch and meter that involved mostly set theory ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply abstract mathematical concepts to analyzing a piece of music in a way that combines the objectivity of math and the subjectivity of music. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of and appreciation for mathematical and geometric models of analyzing music. The course is more conceptual than mathematic, but nevertheless requires you to think quantitatively about several modes of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an intriguing intuition to some of the forms underlying a lot of the music that I know and love. There are many ways of thinking about it that don't involve notes - and it's all contained in a beautiful geometry. There are real world applications for this - particularly if you are a composer. ",
            "\u00a0This course challenged me to consider effective visual, graphical communication, which can be applied to other topics involving continuous variables. ",
            "\u00a0The course involved an in-depth exploration of different ways of analyzing music mathematically, and I definitely gained a greater insight into a very different side of music theory analysis than have been covered in other courses. "

            "\u00a0There's a steep learning curve-- a couple of people in the class already had some exposure to this, so it was hard at times to keep up with their pace. \r\nIt's a different way to think about music, and I appreciated being able to study something outside of my comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it is definitely doubt a good course - Cohn is an excellent professor who is prepared, interesting, dedicated etc. and really a leader in the field. I was prepared to love the class because I had heard such great things but in the end was a touch underwhelmed.  The course is a little math heavy (a result of the fact that it counts for a QR which is worth it) which made it harder to care about some of the material. The general concepts introduced are really interesting though. \r\nMy other disappointed with the course is that it strikes me as a lost opportunity to teach material outside of the Western cannon that so dominates the rest of the music department. You write one paper on a Joplin rag but other than that it is geared toward 19th century art music so much of Yale's music. All the ingredients are there to talk about non-classical music and it would have made the material feel less theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very conceptual, which makes it fun and interesting. It is probably only useful in application for composers though ",
            "\u00a0The music analysis papers were challenging in a way that made them very rewarding when I completed them.  Writing them very much cemented my understanding of the mathematical concepts we talked about.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the class could be a bit slow at times.  I would have liked to spend more time looking at examples and applications in music. ",
            "\u00a0On a unit by unit basis, the course presents information in a logical way, often starting with easily understandable material before branching out into harder, related concepts. The units themselves, however, are mostly unrelatedthere are few unifying themes that can be applied to the course material as a whole. The Powerpoints often contained errors from past years the class was taught. Still, the course remained coherent and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a strong pedagogical approach - Professor Cohn enjoys teaching the material, and puts a lot of work into making difficult concepts digestible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: problem sets facilitated learning; notes were detailed and clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final did not include the musical analysis aspect of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Since the professor was very particular about the notes and materials available on Canvas, it was not possible to read ahead to try and get a sense of the material before class. Additionally, the notes on Canvas did not exactly match up with the format of the class notes (which included many more visual aids and diagrams), which was ultimately a drawback. In terms of strengths, Professor Cohn's teaching was engaging and the pacing of the course worked really well in general. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in the intersection of math and music, you should definitely take this course. It will be considerably harder for those who are not well versed in math (or music, or both!), but the intellectual challenge is rewarding and Cohn is a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0It was a difficult class, but I would highly recommend it-- absolutely mind- blowing! ",
            "\u00a0Great class, super interesting. Professor Cohn is an incredible pedagogue. The material is reasonable, especially if you have a little background in 19th and 20th century theory.\r\n\r\nDefinite take, great QR for music folks. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely for the QR! And probably to others interested in music too, though the field of people interested in the mathematics behind music is quite niche. I would certainly recommend that ever music major take a course with Cohn at some point! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any other music major who needs a QR and wants an interesting class to get it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you have an interest in rather abstract intersections of math and music.  The material is cool, but somewhat esoteric.  The music analysis papers are challenging but in a rewarding way, and the lowest of the five gets dropped.  Having a background in mathematical concepts like set theory helps but is not necessary.  Being comfortable with music theory and being able to come up with an analysis of a piece of music is necessary, however the music analytical thinking skills are far more important than any specifics from a theory class, because the frameworks that you'll be using for your analysis are all taught in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course deals with pretty interesting fields of music theory that I wasn't aware even existed before taking this course. While often challenging, the class remains manageable and engaging enough to stay enjoyable. Also, if you are a music major in need of a QR, this class knocks out both a music theory and QR requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of your relationship with math, this course can arm you with an interesting way of thinking about music in terms of voice-leading, and meter. It's mostly visual, and it will work your visual-spatial reasoning for sure. Professor Cohn puts a lot of effort into making sure that material can be understood. If you're traditionally a music major, the analysis essays will make you feel right at home. ",
            "\u00a0I would; this course challenged me to think about music in new ways and suggested various directions for musical experimentation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course, mainly because of how engaged Prof. Cohn is with the material. In general, the skills gained from this class aren't especially practical in terms of writing music, but are an interesting way of looking at certain aspects of existing rep. "
