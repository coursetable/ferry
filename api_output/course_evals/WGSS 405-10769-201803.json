            "\u00a0I didn't know much about Chinese poetry going in even though I am an EAS double major focusing on China. It was so illuminating and also it teaches you how to read and feel poetry. It's really interesting and important to understand this traditional background and foundation of so many modern day Chinese concepts, imagery, and culture. You will definitely see so much of this class still persist and spillover to contemporary Chinese society, so this is an absolute must to understand for any student who wants to work in or study China in the future, regardless if your future career had nothing to do with poetry or literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely helpful in the development in my knowledge of not only poetry but also Chinese culture and history . ",
            "\u00a0More background as to basic literary themes, symbols, styles, and genres in premodern China. A greater understanding of notions of gender in premodern China, although this part could be more explicitly & deeply explored. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to do close readings of poetry by tracing recurring themes from various periods of Chinese history. I was able to learn so much about the history of women in China and their use of literature, from concubines to wealthy scholar women, and the impact they left on China's literary world. It has truly opened my eyes to the talent of women literati and how complex and beautiful Chinese poetry is. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This class is so small which makes it great, it will really force you to talk and is a great way to ease anyone who is uncomfortable with or new to seminar style classes. Prof Chang is basically a trailblazer in this whole topic so she will tell you so much. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: So much reading, so many poems every week. You really have to figure out how to pick and choose what you want to read. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing, I would not suggest changing anything . ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Broad syllabus, the leminar format allows students with little prior knowledge on premodern Chinese literature to learn more context, Prof. Chang provides a lot of context for most of the pieces.\r\nWeaknesses: The course treats \"Women,\" \"Traditional China,\" and \"China\" as pretty much static constructs. I would've liked to learn more about what each of these meant in different periods throughout Chinese history. If you want a course that's more purely literary where you get closer to the text, we don't really do that in this course, we do more of connecting poems to their broader contexts/themes. Discussions led by TF, I felt were pretty surface-level and didn't go that in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chang is amazing at showing her passion for this subject. Her lectures were comprehensive and because of her expertise in the field of Chinese women's literature, you will absolutely learn more than you'd ever expect every class. There are a lot of readings but are for the most part manageable. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, you get so much value from the work you need to put into this class. You literally only have to write 3 papers (5,6,7 pages) which is nothing for a literature class. Class is completely over by reading period which is a huge plus. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any other student who is interested in East Asia, poetry, feminist history, or just likes taking thought provoking classes. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a broader perspective of an introduction to Chinese modes of thought before 1900, I think the course does a good job of introducing those concepts through women's literature. It doesn't do much to question, deconstruct, or challenge a lot of ideas and doesn't get that close to the text. I recommend this if you also want a women's perspective on Chinese literature. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Even if you've never taken a literature class before, this class is a good way to learn a lot without the work. Professor Chang is amazing and her knowledge will inspire you endlessly. "
