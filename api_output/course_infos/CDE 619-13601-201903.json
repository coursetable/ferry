    "description": "This advanced course focuses on quantitative issues and techniques relevant to the design and analysis of observational epidemiologic studies. Starting with formal definitions of the commonly used epidemiologic parameters, and assuming a working knowledge of ANOVA and linear regression, the course covers analyses based on various related types of regression, e.g., logistic, Poisson, Cox, etc. The GLIM and PECAN computer programs are described and used throughout. Students analyze and discuss data sets of generally increasing complexity.\nPrerequisite: EPH 505, BIS 505, doctoral status, or permission of the instructor.",
