    "description": "Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we focus on the past, present, and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political, and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators, and international organizations. Thus the course encompasses subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We take a broad view of the GFS including its history, geopolitical framework, economic foundations, and legal underpinnings. We consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis is on the practice of global finance more than the theory. The course is open to graduate students throughout Yale and to seniors in Yale College. It follows the SOM academic calendar.\nPrerequisite: an undergraduate or graduate course on macroeconomics. In order to enroll in the course, students must attend the first class meeting.",
