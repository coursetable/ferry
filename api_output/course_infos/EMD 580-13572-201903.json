    "description": "Health systems in low- and middle-income countries are in constant flux in the face of myriad pressures and demands. Under such conditions, how can senior country officials and their donor partners make the best decisions to reform health systems to achieve universal health coverage and improve the allocation of resources to maximize health gains, including on scale-up of programs to fight infectious diseases and maternal and child health problems? The course rounds out and reinforces the Yale M.P.H. experience in the Global Health Concentration by providing students with a thorough understanding of health systems and health reforms\u2014their components, dynamics, performance, and impacts\u2014and by imparting the key tools and data sources needed to conceptualize and assess options related to health system reform and resource allocation, and to make coherent and effective policy and financing recommendations. Using these analytical frameworks and techniques, students analyze 6\u20138 case examples of major country reforms and of the scaling up of national disease control programs and prepare two short policy papers applying what they have learned to real-world health systems challenges.\nThis course is the capstone for the Global Health Concentration and is limited to second-year M.P.H. and Advanced Professional M.P.H. students.
