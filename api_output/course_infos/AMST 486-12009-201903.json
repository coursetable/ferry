    "description": "This interdisciplinary course examines three periods of Asian American history that are paradigmatic within Asian American Studies of race, colonialism, and empire: 19th century Chinese immigrant labor, the internment of Japanese and Japanese Americans during World War II, and Korean Americans in 1992 Los Angeles. Studying these three examples in their national and global contexts, we consider Chinese immigrant railroad workers in relation to both conditions for emigration from China, and to Native American responses to U.S. settlement and expansion into the western frontier; the dispossession and incarceration of Japanese Americans in relation to wartime racialization of Mexican Americans, Blacks, and the longer history of U.S. war in Asia; and finally, we seek to understand the positioning of Korean Americans as \"middlemen\" in post-Civil Rights multiracial Los Angeles in relation to Korean War, and U.S. development and investment in the industrialization of South Korea. We explore how Asian American histories of racialized labor and citizenship in the U.S. are better understood in comparative relation to the histories of other groups, and with consideration of the longer histories of U.S. interventions in Asian countries of origin.\u00c2\u00a0",
