    "description": "This seminar explores the creation in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of a sophisticated system of law, the European Common Law (ius commune). All late medieval and much modern legislation is based on this legal system. The course focuses on its roots in the Roman law of Emperor Justinian and in ecclesiastical legislation. We also study the influence of the ius commune on national and local medieval law. The emphasis is on using law in historical research and on learning the technical skills necessary.\nPrerequisite: facility with Latin or another relevant medieval language.",
