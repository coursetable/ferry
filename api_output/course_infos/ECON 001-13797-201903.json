    "description": "This course introduces students to a selection of ideas that in the past fifty years have merited a\u00a0Nobel Prize in economics. The goal of the course is twofold. First, it serves as an introduction to a wide range of economic topics. Second, by studying the most influential economic ideas, students learn firsthand how economic science has evolved. The course is not structured chronologically, but according to economic areas, such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, poverty, and the environment. No prior knowledge of economics or statistics is assumed.\u00a0\nEnrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.",
