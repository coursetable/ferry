    "description": "This full-year graduate seminar (CBIO 600/CBIO 601) for first-year M.D./Ph.D. students\u2014an elective course for M.D. students\u2014matches the progression of topics in the eighteen-month preclinical medical school curriculum and emphasizes the connections between basic and clinical science, human physiology, and disease. It is directed by M.D./Ph.D. program faculty, and many class discussions are led by expert Yale School of Medicine faculty members who select the papers to be read. Students explore scientific topics in depth, learn about cutting-edge research, and improve their presentation skills. The curriculum provides a framework for critically reading and analyzing papers drawn broadly from the biomedical sciences; this breadth of knowledge is also leveraged in team-based exercises that promote peer-to-peer teaching and learning.\nEnrollment limited to students who have taken or are currently taking CBIO 501/CBIO 502.",
