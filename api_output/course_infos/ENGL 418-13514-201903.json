Reading and discussion of essays, reportage, and book-length works, by scientists and non-scientists alike. Students learn how to create narrative tension while also conveying\u00a0complex\u2014sometimes highly technical\u2014information; the role of the first person in this type of writing; and where the human environment ends and the non-human one begins. Formerly ENGL 241.\nAdmission by permission of the instructor only. Students interested in the course should email the instructor at alan.burdick@gmail.com with the following information: 1.)
