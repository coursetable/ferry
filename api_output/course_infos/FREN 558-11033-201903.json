    "description": "The course considers major authors of twentieth-century France whose work has given rise to fierce debates over translations and re-translations into English. Authors include\u00a0 Proust, C\u00e9line, Camus, Beauvoir, Fanon, and, in a reversal of the issues, the French Faulkner. Theoretical questions include untranslatability; the task of the translator; re-translation and the historicity of the literary text; translation and symbolic capital; and the postcolonial turn in Translation Studies. Seminar work entails close readings of the primary texts, literary history, and translation workshops.\nPrerequisite: advanced reading knowledge of French. Discussion and papers are in English.",
