    "description": "The Vienna of 1900\u2014of Freud, Schnitzler, Strauss, Hofmannsthal, Kraus, Musil, Mahler, Sch\u00f6nberg, Klimt, Schiele, and Wittgenstein\u2014has become the stuff of myth. For good reason: at the turn of the 20th century, the capital of the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual Habsburg Empire became a focal point for experimentation in literature, fine art, architecture, music, film, psychology, and philosophy. In this course, we examine the emergence of new aesthetic strategies and the development of psychoanalysis; we delve into questions of representation and language. How do the artists of the time thematize the pressures of urbanization, secularization, ethnic conflict, cosmopolitanism, sexuality, gender, and consciousness? Continuing into the interwar period, we examine the collapse of empire and its ramifications for architecture, urban planning, and artistic representation. The post-1918 period, leading up to the rise of fascism in the early 1930s and Austria\u2019s Anschluss, witnessed the emergence of progressive social ideals in the public sphere, from childcare to public housing projects. Women writers move to the forefront as chroniclers and analysts of squalid living conditions, rising anti-Semitism, and gender disparities. We also look at the fin-de-si\u00e8cle\u2019s powerful afterlife and its subsequent mythologization and we explore issues of temporality, ethnicity, and media (such as the serialized publication of literary texts, the proliferation of cinemas, and the development of the telephone network).",
