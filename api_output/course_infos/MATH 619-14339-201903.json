    "description": "This course provides an introduction to the language of basic ideas of algebraic geometry. We study affine and projective varieties, and introduce the more general theory of schemes. Our main references are Robin Hartshorne\u2019s book and Ravi Vakil\u2019s lecture notes.\nPrerequisite: commutative algebra at the level of MATH 500/501.",
