    "description": "This course provides an introduction to the major concepts of environmental law with a focus on U.S. statutes, regulations, and treaties for managing waste, air and water pollution, toxic substances, public lands, and global environmental resources. Alternative policy approaches to addressing environmental problems, such as market-based incentives, \u201cnudges,\u201d information disclosure requirements, and voluntary programs, are also considered. Overarching legal and policy concepts, such as federalism, administrative procedure, separation of powers, environmental justice, judicial review, and statutory interpretation, are explored.",
