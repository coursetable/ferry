    "description": "This course studies the emergence of the modern novel as an event in the history of emotions. The long eighteenth-century saw the rise of the novel as we know it as well as a major intellectual shift in how the passions and emotions were conceptualized. We investigate the relationship between these developments, particularly as they converged in the cultural movement of sentimentalism. With our focus on this historical nexus, we take up broader questions about the ways that aesthetic form mediates the emotions, and the ways that emotion responds to social realities like\u00a0capitalism, imperialism, secularization and patriarchy.\u00a0Our focus is on those feelings that might be considered distinctively novelistic\u2014feelings that have influentially served to\u00a0theorize the novel as a genre (interest for the German romantics; desire for psychoanalytic accounts of narrative), and that novels of the period helped codify and theorize (embarrassment, sympathy, wonder, happiness, complicity). Authors include Eliza Haywood, Daniel Defoe, Laurence Sterne, Henry Mackenzie, Frances Burney, William Beckford, William Godwin, and Jane Austen.\u00a0",
