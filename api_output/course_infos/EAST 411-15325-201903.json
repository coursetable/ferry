    "description": "This course explores the deep relationship between various religious orientations and the literary output of Japan, from the earliest forms of writing and inscription to more contemporary forms of digital media. While the course focuses on Buddhism, Shinto, and Daoism specifically, we also explore the interaction of Western religions with Japanese culture, as well as the development of uniquely hybrid and syncretic forms of practice and belief. We also attempt to interrogate our own Western predispositions in conceptualizing what counts as \u201creligious,\u201d \u201cliterary,\u201d and even \u201cJapanese.\u201d While attempting to balance both depth and range, the course covers most major time periods and an array of literary genres.\u00a0",
