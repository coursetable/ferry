    "description": "The course explores the history of Jewish magic from the Bible to our time, focusing on the development and transmission of magical lore in the late antique and medieval Jewish world. We introduce the most important methodological approaches developed to study magical traditions in the context of religious studies, discussing topics such as the impact of magic on premodern cultures, the interculturality of magic, the relation of magic-religion-science, magic and gender, and the efficacy of the magical/ritual act. Through the analysis of magical artifacts and manuscript excerpts, the course familiarizes students with Jewish magical literature and specific magical behaviors, with attention to analogous phenomena developed among Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilizations.",
