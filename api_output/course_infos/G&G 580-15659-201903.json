    "description": "A practical introduction to computing and data analysis, as needed for research and publication in the earth sciences. The primary computation tool is MATLAB. General topics include: computing using MATLAB, making plots and maps, estimating parameters and uncertainties for functions fit to data, and working with gridded data. In addition, there are several application topics, such as: factor analysis, mixture modeling, geomorphic analysis of landscapes, finite difference evolution of river profiles, and flexural loading of the lithosphere.",
