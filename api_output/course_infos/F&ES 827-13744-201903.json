    "description": "This course examines the application of the law to nonhuman animals, the rules and regulations that govern their treatment, and the concepts of \u201canimal welfare\u201d and \u201canimal rights.\u201d The course explores the historical and philosophical treatment of animals; discusses how such treatment impacts the way judges, politicians, lawyers, legal scholars, and lay people see, speak about, and use animals; surveys current animal protection laws and regulations, including overlap with such policy issues as food and agriculture, climate change, and biodiversity protection; describes recent political and legal campaigns to reform animal protection laws; examines the concept of \u201cstanding\u201d and the problems of litigating on behalf of animals; discusses the current classification of animals as \u201cproperty\u201d and the impacts of that classification; and debates the merits and limitations of alternative classifications, such as the recognition of \u201clegal rights\u201d for animals. Students write a series of short response papers. An option to produce a longer research paper for Substantial or Supervised Analytic Writing credit is available for Law School students.
