    "description": "This course surveys the history of the modern Middle East from the start of the 19th century through the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Importantly, the course problematizes the idea of \u2018modernity\u2019 in our historical understanding of the region. Using as a general framework the transition from empire to nation-state, it explores several key themes including discourses and practices of colonialism across the region, the creation of ethno-national, sectarian, and religious identities, social and political upheavals wrought by revolts, rebellions, and new state formations, the changing nature of economies and labor, the rise of authoritarian leadership, the ideological spread of Arab socialism, anti-colonialism, pan-Islamism, and other political and social byproducts and consequences of the creation of \u2018modern\u2019 states. Each week we cover the ways these themes impacted the wider Middle East and North Africa. The readings and lectures encourage students to critically examine the historical explanations, definitions, and arguments regarding the impact or the non-impact of modernity as the driving force for transformations and stagnations in society, culture, politics, and state-formation across the Middle East and North Africa. Class materials include a range of primary source materials and documents in English and in translation, secondary sources, and podcasts.",
