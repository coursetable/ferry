    "description": "Independent research under the supervision of members of the faculty, resulting in a senior essay. Students meet with peers and faculty members regularly throughout the fall term to discuss the progress of their research. Projects should offer substantial opportunity for interdisciplinary work on environmental problems. Students typically complete a two-term senior essay, but students completing the requirements of two majors may consider a one-term senior project.",
