    "description": "This workshop is devoted to in-depth exploration of new, cutting-edge research in the social sciences treating the interaction of race, ethnicity, gender, and class. The workshop focuses on methods of analysis ranging from ethnography to quantitative approaches as utilized in the disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, sociology, and interdisciplinary fields utilizing any combination of these disciplines. We intend to address new approaches to classic issues and contemporary questions of interest to social scientists and policy makers such as (but not limited to): race relations; inequality; racial and class formation; criminal justice; politics; and education and social mobility. Graduate students taking the workshop for course credit must attend consistently and write an end-of-term paper. This course satisfies the social science requirement in African American Studies.",
