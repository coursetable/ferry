    "description": "Que sais-je? What do I know? This is Montaigne\u2019s motto, engraved on a medal in 1576 at the writer's request. At the crossroad of disciplines, this seminar explores how Michel de Montaigne develops a philosophy of doubt by literary means. We see that he does not naively or theoretically subscribe to the skeptical tradition, but rather proposes a practical and singular use of a non-judgmental attitude in the writing of Les Essais\u2014the early modern masterpiece of the French literature of the self. We read essays on topics such as: idleness, education, eroticism, imagination. These texts are coupled with short, theoretical excerpts (Sextus Empiricus, Diog\u00e8ne La\u00ebrce, Henri Estienne).
