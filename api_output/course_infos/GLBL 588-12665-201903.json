    "description": "This introduction to contemporary international law studies the role of authority in the decision-making processes of the world community, at the constitutive level where international law is made and applied and where the indispensable institutions for making decisions are established and maintained, as well as in the various sectors of the public order that is established. Consideration is given to formal as well as operational prescriptions and practice with regard to the participants in this system (states, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, political parties, pressure groups, multinational enterprises, other private associations, private armies and gangs, and individuals); the formal and informal arenas of interaction; the allocation of control over and regulation of the resources of the planet; the protection of people and the regulation of nationality; and the allocation among states of jurisdiction to make and apply law. In contrast to more traditional approaches, which try to ignore the role of power in this system, that role will be candidly acknowledged, and the problems and opportunities it presents will be explored. Special attention is given to (1) theory; (2) the establishment, transformation, and termination of actors; (3) control of access to and regulation of resources, including environmental prescriptions; (4) nationality and human rights; and (5) the regulation of armed conflict. Scheduled examination or paper option. Also LAW 20040.",
