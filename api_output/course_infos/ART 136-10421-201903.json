    "description": "An introductory course in black-and-white photography concentrating on the use of 35mm cameras. Topics include the lensless techniques of photograms and pinhole photography; fundamental printing procedures; and the principles of film exposure and development. Assignments encourage the variety of picture-forms that 35mm cameras can uniquely generate. Student work is discussed in regular critiques. Readings examine the invention of photography and the fl\u00c3\u00a2neur tradition of small-camera photography as exemplified in the work of artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, Robert Frank, and Garry Winogrand. Materials fee: $150.",
