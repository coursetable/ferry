    "description": "Considered one of the greatest novels of all time, Victor Hugo's\u00a0Les Mis\u00e9rables\u00a0(1862) offers more than a thrilling story, unforgettable characters, and powerful writing. It offers a window into history. Working from a new translation, this seminar studies Hugo's epic masterpiece in all its unabridged glory, but also uses it as a lens to explore the world of nineteenth-century France\u2014including issues such as the criminal justice system, religion, poverty, social welfare, war, prostitution, industrialization, and revolution.\u00a0Students gain the tools to work both as close readers and as cultural historians in order to illuminate the ways in which Hugo's text intersects with its context. Attention is also paid to famous stage and screen adaptations of the novel: what do they get right and what do they get wrong? Taught in English, no knowledge of French is required.\u00a0",
