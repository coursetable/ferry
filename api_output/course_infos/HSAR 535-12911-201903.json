    "description": "This seminar examines the historical development of a national style in Russian decorative arts and material culture from the eighteenth century to the early twentieth. Although known for borrowing liberally from western European artistic traditions, Russian imperial culture\u2014from the baroque and neoclassical courts of Elizabeth and Catherine to the exported \u201cnative\u201d imaginaries of the Ballets Russes\u2014also sought to distinguish itself in design, scale, manufacture, and style. Structured around a series of case studies, this seminar considers highlights from the history of Russian decorative arts, all while exploring broader questions about the transnational movement of style, the intersection of nationalism and design, the invention of \u201cnative\u201d cultures, and the materialities of empire and modernity. Topics include the branding of Catherine the Great; Russia\u2019s natural resources and trade networks; consumer culture in St. Petersburg; the materialism of realism; the Abramtsevo artists\u2019 colony and the discovery of folk art; russkii stil\u2019 (Russian Style) at the World\u2019s Fairs; curating ethnographies and archaeologies; and the \u201crelics\u201d of the Romanovs. Organized as an intensive research seminar, this course brings the central conceptual and theoretical concerns of visual and material culture studies (e.g., materiality and thing theory, ornament and the decorative, the socioeconomics of taste) to a historical and object-based consideration of Russian style. Significant use is made of the museum and library collections at Yale and nearby.",
