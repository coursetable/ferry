    "description": "This course uses moments in the history of Yale University to shed light on the forms, functions, and trajectory of U.S. global power from the late 19th century through the early 21st century. Key episodes include missionary work in East Asia, scientific expeditions in South America, mobilization for war and Cold War, and the internationalization of the student body. Students investigate these episodes by reading scholarly work as well as archival sources, and through discussions with Yale faculty and staff.",
