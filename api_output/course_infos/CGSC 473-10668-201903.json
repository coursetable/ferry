The student must be supervised by a member of the Cognitive Science faculty, who sets the requirements and meets regularly with the student. To register, a student must submit a written plan of study to the director of undergraduate studies and the faculty supervisor. The normal minimum requirement is a term paper, but individual faculty members may set alternative equivalent requirements.\nOnly one term may be offered toward the major, with permission of the director of undergraduate studies; two terms may be offered toward the bachelor's degree.",
