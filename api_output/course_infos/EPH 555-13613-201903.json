Each team works with a sponsoring organization (e.g., unit within Yale, local health department, state agency, community organization, other nongovernmental organization). The course affords the opportunity to apply concepts and competencies learned in in the classroom to these important areas of environmental/climate justice, climate change, sustainability, and public health. This course should be of interest to students across Yale School of Public Health, Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, and the University, including Yale College juniors and seniors. In addition, this course is one of the options available to students to fulfill the practice requirement for the M.P.H. degree.",
