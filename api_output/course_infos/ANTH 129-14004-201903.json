    "description": "This introductory survey seminar emphasizes social and political anthropology. It explores the politics of the region from an ethnographic perspective. Students gain a grounding in key themes and texts, as well as an understanding of the wider issues as they pertain to a very diverse region of the world grouped under the concept of the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d We cover some of the most pertinent thematic areas such as the aftermath of colonialism, the nature of states and nationalism, the role of religion in the diverse societies of the Middle East as well as various formations of Islamism, gender, mass media, social movements, alongside the impacts of transnationalism. In addition, students have the chance to delve more deeply into four ethnographies on the region.\u00a0",
