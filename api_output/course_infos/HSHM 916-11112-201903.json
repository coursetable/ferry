    "description": "This is an academic writing workshop for students in\u00a0HSHM\u00a0and related disciplines, with a focus on the challenges of writing about the history of knowledge. Students studying race, gender, slavery, environmental history, and other fields of inquiry where knowledge is produced about bodies, places, and peoples are welcome. We work on skills such as balancing exposition and narrative, working with actors\u2019 categories, writing for different audiences, and developing an authorial voice. Students have the opportunity to receive feedback on early versions of dissertation prospectuses, chapters, grant proposals, or articles. The course is meant to give students the opportunity to test ideas, get feedback on drafts, and work on revising, while adding as little as possible to their overall burden of course work.",
