    "description": "The quantitative treatment of chemical processes, primarily those involving inorganic chemicals, in aquatic systems such as lakes, oceans, rivers, estuaries, groundwaters, and wastewaters. Review of chemical thermodynamics, followed by discussions of acid-base, precipitation-dissolution, coordination, and reduction-oxidation reactions. Emphasis on equilibrium calculations as a tool for understanding variables that govern chemical composition of aquatic systems and the fate of inorganic pollutants.\u00a0\nPrerequisite: ENVE 120 and working knowledge of algebra.\u00a0",
