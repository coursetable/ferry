    "description": "In this course we explore the role that biological innovation and changes in tectonic process have played in shaping global biogeochemical cycles through time. The course focuses on extensively investigated elements (C, S), nutrients (N, P), and redox-sensitive metals (e.g., Fe, Mo, Cr, Zn, Cd). We survey key historical papers that provide the foundation for our understanding of geochemical cycles, basic modeling approaches, and widely utilized geochemical tracers; and we explore recent literature with the goal of discussing major uncertainties and key unanswered questions concerning the co-evolution of life and Earth surface processes. Students are expected to actively participate and help steer discussions, as well as to individually explore a specific aspect of the evolution of global biogeochemical cycling in detail over the course of the term.",
