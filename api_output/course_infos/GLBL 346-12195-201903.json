    "description": "This course focuses on four conflicts of the 1990s\u2014Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Kosovo\u2014specifically through the lens of human rights. Why are these four conflicts important when other current conflicts\u2014Syria, Yemen, South Sudan\u2014are urgent and pressing? The 1990s was the era of supposed \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d wars. Can we learn from what happened in that decade? The course instructor reported extensively on all four conflicts and will use her own on-the-ground knowledge to dig deep into the roots of the conflicts; the specific battles; turning points; the case studies of human rights abuse; and finally, political solutions and post-conflict resolution.",
