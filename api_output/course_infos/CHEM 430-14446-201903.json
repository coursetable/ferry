    "description": "The fundamentals of statistical mechanics developed and used to elucidate gas phase and condensed phase behavior, as well as to establish a microscopic derivation of the postulates of thermodynamics. Topics include ensembles; Fermi, Bose, and Boltzmann statistics; density matrices; mean field theories; phase transitions; chemical reaction dynamics; time-correlation functions; and Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations.\nPrerequisites: CHEM 328 or 332, and CHEM 333, or permission of instructor.",
