Students present their work during class time and have the opportunity for an in-depth critique and discussion about their pieces. There is no singular focus in this critique, as the balance of pragmatic and conceptual considerations surrounding the work is examined and discussed in a fluid way depending on the work at hand and the intent of the artist.\nEnrollment limited.
