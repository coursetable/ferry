    "description": "This course studies Victorian poetry and its fraught reception in twentieth- and twenty-first-century literary criticism. As we examine how the modern discipline of literary studies developed out of and often against Victorian poetics and aesthetics, we attend to key concepts like form, method, judgment, pedagogy, value, period, and canon. Readings may include poems by Tennyson, Barrett Browning, Morris, Swinburne, Toru Dutt, the Rossettis, Pauline Johnson, and Pound; criticism by Germaine de Sta\u00c3\u00abl, John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Vernon Lee, Susanne Langer, the New Critics (Richards, Empson, Wellek, Brooks, Wimsatt), and Veronica Forrest-Thomson; and recent work in the history of the discipline and historical poetics. Course texts supplemented by visits to the Yale art museums and the Beinecke archives.",
