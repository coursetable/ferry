    "description": "This course studies the political and cultural dynamics of free speech and freedom of expression in Greco-Roman antiquity in order to lend historical depth to, and invite the sampling of alternative perspectives on, similar issues in our own day. The main point of focus in the class is on humorous free speech as practiced in certain accepted and \u2018rule bound\u2019 forms, such as comedy, oratory, iambic invective and satire, and the breaking of the rules in those same forms, as well as in certain non-sanctioned kinds of aggressive expression such as graffiti, anonymous pamphlets, off-script improvisations in comedy and mime, and public shaming rituals. We look into the questions of who can get away with saying what in the ancient world, and how the parameters of acceptable humor and abuse were set and policed. Students examine the cultural politics that are built into the rules, as well as the particular habits of humorous expression, both proper and improper, as they came to be practiced in certain political milieu (Archaic Greece, Democratic Athens, Republican Rome, Rome under the emperors), by certain persons (slaves, freedmen, elites, males, females, foreigners, the young, and the old) in certain historical contexts (e.g. in the aftermath of triumphs and failures), for certain purposes (e.g. to celebrate, to resolve crises, to do political work, to censor and punish, and so on).",
