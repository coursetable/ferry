    "description": "Applications of quantitative biophysical methods to biological macromolecules. Emphasis is placed on interpreting experimental data obtained by various biophysical methods to gain structural and dynamic information to address biological questions at the molecular level. Topics include mainly spectroscopic methods, such as Raman, single-molecule, fluorescence, FTIR, chiroptical, and higher-order optical spectroscopies. Discussions focus on current and classic studies reported in the literature.",
