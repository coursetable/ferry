    "description": "This course deals with the application of basic microeconomic analysis to public policy issues. The principal goal is to teach students the process of economic reasoning and how to apply that reasoning to policy issues in the real world. The course covers the basic topics in microeconomic theory: consumer theory, production theory, market models from competition to monopoly, theories of labor and capital markets, and models of externalities and other common market failures. Some calculus will be used without apology along with a great deal of algebra and graphical analysis.",
