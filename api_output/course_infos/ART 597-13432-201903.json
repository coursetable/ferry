    "description": "A hands-on, materials based course offered within a dedicated shared studio space, the Fabric Lab will explore fibers related praxis through a series of investigations into weave structures, stitching, needlecraft and knots, as well as the application and removal of color from fabric via printing and dying techniques. Instruction is intended to serve individual studio practice, but weekly meetings in the classroom space will provide an opportunity to develop and share technical skills as a group in relationship to specific prompts. Readings and presentations will contextualize our material explorations within contemporary art practice, unpacking historical hierarchies of \u201cfine art\u201d vs \u201ccraft\u201d and attending to the diverse social histories that underlie our engagement with textiles. The course will include some site visits TBA, including an artist\u2019s studio, a textile conservator\u2019s workshop, and an institutional fibers department.",
