    "description": "The international community is now responding to an unprecedented level of complex humanitarian disasters, primarily the result of civilian displacement caused by protracted armed conflicts. This seminar explores both the critical historical moments that forged modern humanitarian practice and the current trends and challenges that may affect the future of disaster assistance. The goal is to equip students with a holistic and applied understanding of how the humanitarian system operates and the core geopolitical dynamics that shape it. Beginning with Henri Dunant, the birth of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the early sources of international humanitarian law, the course follows the evolution of humanitarian aid provision from the nineteenth century to the present. Particular foci of reading and class discussion include the Biafra crisis and the Ethiopian famine of the 1980s, the role of the Rwanda genocide in launching a series of humanitarian reforms, and the ongoing impacts of the European migrant crisis. Students are expected to track specific ongoing humanitarian emergencies as part of preparation for class discussion, complete weekly readings, and write and present a capstone paper on an individually identified topic.",
