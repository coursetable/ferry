    "description": "Interactions of computer architecture and systems software for high-performance systems. In particular, the focus is on advanced aspects of compilation, particularly program analysis, code generation, optimization (i.e., the back-end of modern compilers). No prior exposure to compilers is assumed but the front-end (i.e., lexing, parsing, etc.) is covered only briefly, in as much as is needed for studying compilation back-end. Hands-on exposure to programming projects using LLVM.\nPrerequisites: CPSC 202, CPSC 223, CPSC 323.\u00c2\u00a0",
