    "description": "Interdisciplinary exploration of Russia\u2019s nineteenth-century imperial culture, history, and politics. Focus on how modern Russian culture reflected, shaped, and challenged imperial reality; on how empire figured in negotiations of Russian national identity; and on Russian versions of Orientalism and colonialism. Special emphasis on representations of peripheral regions, relations between ethnic groups, and the role of gender and race in Russia\u2019s imperial imagination. Authors include Pushkin, Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, Lermontov, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Leskov, Chekhov, and Tolstoy. Materials combine fiction, poetry, travel writing, journalism, and painting, with readings in postcolonial studies, history, political science, and anthropology. Students without a reading knowledge of Russian need permission of the instructor.",
