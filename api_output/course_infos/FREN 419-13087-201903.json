    "description": "The mythical castle of Louis XIV epitomizes the continuous grasp that the French 17th-century has on the collective imagination. Attracting millions of tourists every year, welcoming expensive Versailles-labeled masked parties, it incarnates the French Classicism of legendary authors including Moli\u00e8re, Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine, S\u00e9vign\u00e9, and La Fayette. However, just as the castle was once simply a hunting lodge, literature in the age of Louis XIV was not always considered classical: it became such. This course explores and deconstructs the myths of Versailles, from the 17th century to present days. Through literature, music, painting, as well as modern novels and films, we study canonical and less-canonical works, inquiring how the mythical image was built, integrated into national identity and maintained, reading the resistance it raised then and now against this cultural hegemony and understanding how some authors (especially women writers) were dismissed by history while being genuine superstars back then. In the shadows of the monument appears a vivid world, full of fascinating cultural, commercial, and political struggles.",
