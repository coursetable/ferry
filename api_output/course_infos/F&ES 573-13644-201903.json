    "description": "Urban ecology is the interdisciplinary study of urban and urbanizing systems from local to global\u00a0scales. While urban ecology shares many features with the biological science of ecology, it\u00a0emphasizes linkages with social, economic, and physical sciences and the humanities.\u00a0Geographically, the subject includes central and edge cities, suburbs of various ages and\u00a0densities, and exurban settlements in which urban lifestyles and economic commitments are\u00a0dominant. In application, urban ecology can be useful as a social-ecological science for making\u00a0cities more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. Emerging \u201cgrand challenges\u201d in urban ecology\u00a0include the development of robust approaches and understanding of (1) integrated social-ecological\u00a0systems in urban and urbanizing environments; (2) the assembly and function of novel ecological communities and ecosystems under novel environmental conditions; (3) drivers of\u00a0human well-being in diverse urban areas; (4) pathways for developing healthy, sustainable, and\u00a0disaster-resilient cities; and (5) co-production of actionable science for policy, planning, design, and management.",
