    "description": "This course focuses on the law as it impacts the health of populations, focusing on the legal powers and duties of federal, state, and local governments to equitably promote and protect the health of their communities, as well as the constitutional constraints on those powers to protect individual rights. It is a course designed specifically for students with no legal training, introducing students to the multiple ways the law acts as a structural and social determinant of health and health inequities as well as how the law can be used as a tool to promote health in individuals and health justice among populations. Tools examined include the use of direct and indirect regulation to alter the information and built environments, control communicable disease, and reduce chronic disease and injury; governments\u2019 \u201cpower of the purse\u201d\u2014to tax and spend\u2014to fund public health programs and services, and influence individual and corporate behavior; and the role of the courts in interpreting law and resolving disputes among branches and levels of government as well as among individuals, businesses, and government.
