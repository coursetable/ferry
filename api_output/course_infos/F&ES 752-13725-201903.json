    "description": "Tropical forests contain extraordinarily high biological diversity and provide critical ecosystem services, yet are being rapidly destroyed and degraded by human activities. This course focuses on the structure, function, and diversity of intact and degraded tropical forests, with an emphasis on the ecological processes that shape these unique and diverse ecosystems. We also discuss the major threats to tropical forests, as well as examples of tropical forest recovery following disturbance. The course involves a mix of lectures and student-led discussions. Students who successfully complete this course are given priority for F&ES 717.",
