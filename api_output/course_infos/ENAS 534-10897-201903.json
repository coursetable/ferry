    "description": "Introduction to materials, classes of materials from atomic structure to physical properties. Major classes of materials: metals, ceramics and glasses, and polymers, addressing their specific characteristics, properties, and biological applications. Throughout the presentation of the synthesis, characterization, and properties of the classes of materials, a connection is made to the selection of materials for use in specific biological applications by matching the material\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s properties to those necessary for success in the application. Case studies address the successes and failures of particular materials from each of the classes in biological applications.",
