    "description": "This basic knowledge course is designed to introduce students to a range of sociocultural and political factors that drive the actions of individuals and communities surrounding natural resource management. In Part 1, Introduction to Social Science and Conservation, we explore basic questions such as: What is knowledge? What is nature? Students are introduced to the many disciplines that intersect environmental problems, and specific attention is placed on the field of political ecology. In\u00a0Part 2, Justice and Indigenous Peoples, we learn the basic concepts of \u201cjustice\u201d and discuss the ways in which climate change can be seen as a justice issue. We also explore the thorny issues of integrating local knowledge with scientific knowledge. In\u00a0Part 3, Environmental\u00a0Governance, we explore the role of the state and markets in shaping natural resource use. Concepts like property rights, the commons, and decentralization are introduced. Finally, in\u00a0Part 4, Pulling It Together: Working with Communities, we discuss basic approaches to community-based, participatory research and how to integrate culture and livelihoods into conservation.",
