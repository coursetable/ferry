    "description": "A survey of the ways that gender/sexuality is organized through and against the nation-state, with particular attention to citizenship, rights discourses, and global migration. The course looks to establish a foundational understanding of the conjunctures between liberal governance and the regulation of reproductive, sexual, and family life. At the same time, our wider conceptual arc takes up more recent critical debates about the entanglement of sexual intimacy, race, and national belonging during the territorial expansion of empire in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this reconsideration of the geographies of sexual citizenship, we focus on British, Commonwealth, and postcolonial case studies in the Caribbean, Africa, Middle East, Indian Ocean, and South Pacific. Texts include selections from legal history, travel narratives, life-writing, literature, the history of sexuality, sociology, anthropology, critical race theory, queer theory, and indigenous studies.
