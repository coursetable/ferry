    "description": "Introduction to the use of quantitative methods for the study of tectonic processes. The focus of the course shifts each year, covering topics such as flexural isostasy; coupling between climate, surface erosion, and deformation; kinematics of plate motion; thermal methods for studying erosion and faulting; processes and products of deformation. The course consists of a combination of lectures and seminar discussions. Students develop and complete a significant research project, either on their own or as a group.",
