    "description": "The BIS departmental seminar fosters engagement with innovative statistical researchers outside Yale and exposes students to new ideas in statistical research that they may not encounter in their traditional course work. Topics discussed in seminar talks vary, but a major theme is statistical-methodological innovation in the service of public health. Although no credit or grade is awarded, satisfactory performance will be noted on the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transcript.",
