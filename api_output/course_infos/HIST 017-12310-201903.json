    "description": "Education remains an essential element in Native American history, a complex arena full of conflict, resistance, adaptation, and social change.\u00a0Charting the centuries-long relationships between Native Americans and Euro-American institutions of higher education, this seminar seeks to expose students to the educational history of Native North America. Through in-class assignments, discussion, and sets of experiential campus and off-campus tours, this class both introduces the educational history of Native North America and links it with the broader political history of federal Indian law and policy.\u00a0Enrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.",
