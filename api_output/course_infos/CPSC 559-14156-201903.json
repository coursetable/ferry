    "description": "This advanced course brings together methods from machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction to enable interactive machines to perceive and act in a variety of environments. Part of the course examines approaches for perception with different sensing devices and algorithms; the other part focuses on methods for decision-making and applied machine learning for control. The course is a combination of lectures, state-of-the-art reading, presentations and discussions, programming assignments, and a final team project.\nPrerequisites: CPSC 570 and understanding of probability, differential calculus, linear algebra, and planning (in Artificial Intelligence). Programming assignments require proficiency in Python and high-level familiarity with C++. Students who do not fit this profile may be allowed to enroll with the permission of the instructor.",
