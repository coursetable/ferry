    "description": "This seminar is designed to introduce students to a range of art historical methods past and present: a variety of formalisms, connoisseurship, different kinds of iconography, the social history of art, psychoanalysis, and a number of other approaches that are sometimes referred to as visual culture. Readings include classic texts by Riegl, W\u00c3\u00b6lfflin, Panofsky, and Warburg, and more recent approaches by Alpers, Clark, and Crary, among others.",
