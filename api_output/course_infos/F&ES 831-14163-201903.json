    "description": "This research seminar explores the relationship between society and natural resources in a genuinely interdisciplinary manner (explicit, systematic, contextual, using a comprehensive meta-framework). This fall\u2019s session is a \u201creflexive conversation\u201d about the problematic situation in which we all now find ourselves. We live in a time of growing uncertainty and mounting problems. This situation can be best understood as constituting a \u201creflexive moment.\u201d The reflexive moment encourages a reconsideration of past developments and future possibilities (personal to global). We want to find the best way to understand ourselves (personally and professionally) in the current and foreseeable problematic situation (local to global, immediate to multi-decade). We should never forget that we share the planet with millions of other forms of life. We want to find ways to mobilize our knowledge and practice to help fellow humans live fulfilling lives (justice) and address real-world challenges on varying scales (environmental health). The question before us: Can we come to some clarity about this reflexive moment, our growing problems (environmental and social), and the myriad relationships involved? We discuss these and many other matters, seeking clarity, a foundation, and direction for ourselves, work, and lives. Active participation, reading, discussion, lectures, guests, and projects make up the seminar.",
