    "description": "What does it mean to be new, original, or innovative in literature? On the contrary, what does being traditional imply? What socioeconomic,\u00a0ideological, and aesthetic issues lie behind those concepts and questions? This seminar addresses these\u00a0questions at the time they first became central for France, when literature and arts\u00a0became\u00a0a market as well as\u00a0a major political issue. Through literary and metaliterary works (Moli\u00e8re, Desjardins, La Bruy\u00e8re, Scud\u00e9ry, Gu\u00e9ret, Perrault) we reconsider\u00a0our own relationship to novelty, tradition, and literary creation. In order to get hands-on with the most modern evolutions in the field, we also develop a critical edition of La Bruy\u00e8re\u2019s\u00a0Les Caract\u00e8res, a canonical work that looks reactionary in terms of\u00a0its content and extremely modern in its printing\u00a0technique. This edition is backed by a Rosenkranz grant for digital humanities in the classroom that will allow us to work with a professional\u00a0designer.",
