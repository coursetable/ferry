    "description": "Climate change has the observable potential to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, frosts, and floods. In response, many concerned citizens, communities, scientific consortia, industries, and governments around the world have sought to adapt to climate change for the sake of global well-being. This course examines climate change adaptation as a risk management strategy; how it builds resilience where there was vulnerability. Health protective activities resulting from thoughtful, interdisciplinary approaches that consider political, commercial, and socio-cultural factors are held as the ideal among all adaptive responses. Scope includes but is not limited to dynamics in the U.S., Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean. Throughout the semester, participants engage in lectures, discussions, interactive exercises, and collaborative presentations.\u00c2\u00a0Enrollment is open to junior and senior undergraduates of Yale University, with preference given to Jackson Institute Global Health Studies Scholars. Non-Global Health Studies Scholars require permission to enroll and should contact the instructor (steve.whittaker@yale.edu) with a brief statement of interest. Cap of 18 students.",
