    "description": "Artistic research expands the research form to focus on haptic and tactile study of physical and historical objects. Through field trips to various special collections and libraries, including the Beinecke, the Yale Art Gallery, and the Map Collection, students respond\u00a0to specific objects in the\u00a0vast resources of Yale University. Group discussions, lectures, and critiques throughout the term help foster individual projects. Each student conducts research through the artistic mediums of drawing, photography, video, and audio, to slowly build an interconnected collection of research that is also an artwork.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnrollment limited to first-year students.
