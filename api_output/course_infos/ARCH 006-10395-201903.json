    "description": "What is architecture, and how is it conceived, relative to notions of the urban \u2013 to the broader, deeper, messier web of ideas, forms, and fantasies constituting \u201cthe city?\u201d Can architecture play a role in defining the city, as such, or does the city\u2019s political and social construction place it outside the scope of specifically architectural concerns? Likewise, what role can the city play in establishing, interrogating, and extrapolating the limits of architecture, whether as a practice, a discourse, or a physical manifestation of human endeavor in the material environment? This course addresses these and other related questions, seeking to position architecture in its broader urban, social, cultural, political, intellectual, and aesthetic contexts. In so doing, it assumes the position that the nature and character of the urban can largely be characterized in terms of the manner in which we, as a society, conceive, construct, and contribute to notions of \u201cthe public,\u201d or \u201cthe common.\u201d\nEnrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.\nPrerequisite: general knowledge of 20th-century history.",
