    "description": "Through lectures, discussions, writing activities, and revisions, students become familiar with the principles of scientific grant writing, including language, style, content, and how to formulate a hypothesis and specific aims. Students effectively articulate their overall research plan and the significance of their research in writing and in oral presentations, and they learn to critique and review grant proposals by engaging in peer-review activities with fellow classmates. By the end of the term, students review, revise, and complete the research strategy for an NRSA F31 or NSF and/or the foundation for their qualifying proposal.",
