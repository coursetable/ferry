    "description": "A research seminar. The first weeks are devoted to reading and discussing a number of outstanding microhistorical studies of individuals, families, communities, incidents, and processes, principally (though not exclusively) drawn from the literature on the early modern period. Particular attention is paid to questions of sources and their use. Thereafter members of the class undertake individual microhistorical studies on subjects of their choice and present work-in-progress papers to the seminar.",
