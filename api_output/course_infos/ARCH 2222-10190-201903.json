    "description": "This course explores how machines see our environment, with emphasis on the role of human subjectivity. With their ability to see at resolutions, scales, and spectrums outside of the human eye, mechanical eyes can open new ways of inscribing information into our material world and also reveal our own biases and habits. The course will be a cumulative series of studies, beginning with material excavation, exploring the materials through virtual reality and motion capture techniques, creating a final object via milling and fabrication, and displaying the final object in a group exhibition at CCAM.",
