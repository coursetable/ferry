    "description": "Art history has conventionally maintained a curious \u201cscale blindness\u201d\u2014a cultivated insensibility to the influence of scale on the operations of perception and the work of interpretation. We are often similarly blind when it comes to scaling technologies woven into art history\u2019s basic practices, from the slide lecture to the textbook\u2019s reproductions. This course brings the subject into focus by examining theories of scale alongside recent art historical writing. We ask: Is an artwork\u2019s relation to scale different from other objects\u2019? How have technologies of scaling, from photography to GIS mapping, confronted the materiality of artworks? How have\u00a0theories of scale in other disciplines informed our descriptions of the scale of artworks? And how does the attempt to conduct art history at a \u201cglobal scale\u201d expose the cultural and ideological specificity of scale?",
