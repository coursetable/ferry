Discussions involve rationale and hypothesis testing for a project, data analysis techniques, reporting and interpretation of results. It is expected that manuscripts developed in the course are worthy of publication and that oral presentations are of a caliber for subject area conferences and meetings. Three hours lecture. Enrollment limited to twelve.\nPrerequisite: F&ES 659 or permission of the instructor.",
