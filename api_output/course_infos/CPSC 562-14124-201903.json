    "description": "An introduction to spectral graph theory motivated by computer science, covering advanced topics in linear algebra and exploring the combinatorial meaning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with graphs. Applications to optimization, numerical linear algebra, error-correcting codes, pseodorandomness, and the discovery of graph structure.\nPrerequisites: linear algebra, graph theory, and comfort with proof-based math courses.",
