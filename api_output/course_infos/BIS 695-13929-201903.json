    "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with the opportunity of gaining practical experience in the analysis and development of biostatistical methods as part of a health sciences research team including medicine, public health, pharmaceutical industry, or health care delivery. This experience provides a basis for developing a dissertation thesis proposal that has practical significance for addressing important scientific questions. Students work with a biostatistics faculty mentor to select a suitable placement for the summer intern, and a one-page description of the plans will be submitted to the instructor at least three weeks prior to starting the program, for approval within two weeks. The internship must be full-time: 35\u201340 hours per week for 10\u201312 weeks during the summer. Upon completion of the internship, a written report of the work must be submitted to the instructor no later than October 1.\nPrerequisite: completion of one year of the Ph.D. or M.S. program or permission of the instructor.",
