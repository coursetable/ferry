    "description": "This course examines a number of significant forms of social change occurring in Southeast Asia in recent years. Fueled by new digital technologies; environmental change; globalized economies, politics, human rights, and religion\u2014Southeast Asia is experiencing a rapid transformation. Some of these changes are visible such as the ubiquitous use of mobile phones, transformed city skylines, rampant deforestation, and changing infrastructure. However, some are less visible such as the forced evacuations of the poor from urban centers, increasing state surveillance, and new forms of relationships between people and places enabled through digital communications. Topics include migration, politics and political activism, urban development, environmentalism, labor, violence, religion, popular culture, gender, and relationships. Principle readings include key works from a range of disciplines and represent a number of Southeast Asian nations. The course includes a visual component through a number of in class film screenings.\u00a0",
