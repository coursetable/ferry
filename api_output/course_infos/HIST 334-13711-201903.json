    "description": "The lecture explores the history of colonialism, settler colonialism, violence, armed struggle, and the subsequent development of a myriad of nationalist and religious-nationalist ideologies as they came to be understood by Palestinian Arabs, Zionist settlers, Palestinian citizens of Israel, Islamists, and Israeli religious/national groups. The readings and discussions help us understand how certain ideologies of belonging became meaningful, important, and even inherently necessary for various communities and groups in late Ottoman Palestine, the Palestine Mandate, and the post-1948 state of Israel, alongside the occupied Palestinian territories. We examine more specific themes including the symbolism of the gun, the figure of the refugee, the idea of homeland in historical narratives, tactics of resistance to occupation (by both Palestinian Arabs and Zionists), and collaboration between Arab, Jewish, and British actors. We make use of documentary and other primary sources and texts, including poems, excerpts from literature, memoirs, film footage, posters, and other forms of media. By the end of the semester, students are able to analyze and discuss the historical significance of the multi-faceted ideologies and motivations held by actors involved in the armed struggle movement(s) in Palestine and Israel.",
