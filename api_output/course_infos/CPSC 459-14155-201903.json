    "description": "This advanced course brings together methods from machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction to enable interactive machines to perceive and act in a variety of environments. Part of the course examines approaches for perception with different sensing devices and algorithms; the other part focuses on methods for decision making and applied machine learning for control.\u00a0Understanding of probability, differential calculus, linear algebra, and planning (in Artificial Intelligence) is expected for this course. Programming assignments require proficiency in Python and high-level familiarity with C++.\nPrerequisites: CPSC 201, CPSC 202, and CPSC 470 (or 570), or permission of the instructor.\u00a0",
