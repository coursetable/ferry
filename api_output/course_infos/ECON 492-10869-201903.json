    "description": "Students deciding to write one-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON\u00a0491, or two-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON\u00a0491 and 492, must choose their topics and advisers by Monday, September 30, 2019. One-term senior essays are due on Monday, December 2, 2019 by 4:30 pm. Two-term senior essays are due by 4:30 pm on Wednesday, April 1, 2020. Essays should be submitted electronically to the Economics department (qazi.azam@yale.edu) by the due date. Late essays will not be accepted without a dean's excuse. Advisers are chosen with the assistance of the DUS. The format and character of the departmental senior essay may vary to suit the interest of the student and the demands of the topic, but it is expected that the tools and concepts of economic analysis will be employed and that the essay will contain original research. Paper lengths may vary; the normal expectation is thirty pages. Students may receive up to two credits for the senior essay, though it counts as only one departmental seminar whether one or two terms are taken. Meetings for seniors to discuss the senior essay guidelines and requirements will be held on Tuesday August 27, 2019 at 12:15 pm. and Wednesday, August 28, 2019 at 4:00 pm. in Room 106, 28 Hillhouse Avenue. Seniors planning to write either a one-term or a two-term senior essay should attend one of these meetings. Details regarding calculation of Distinction will be discussed and senior essay guidelines will be distributed.\nSenior essay prospectus forms are due Monday, September 30, 2019. Students who do not turn the prospectus in on time will not be permitted to write an essay.",
