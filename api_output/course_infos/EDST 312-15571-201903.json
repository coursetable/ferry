    "description": "This course is an iconoclastic introduction to the study of education. Besides examining the purposes and practice of education and learning across a wide variety of times and places, the course examines the study of education today in order to see what can be gained from a skeptical approach to the subject. Particular emphasis is placed on the origins and development of the research university.",
