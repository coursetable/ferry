    "description": "This class is divided into two parts. The first covers/reviews the necessary background of Riemannian and hyperbolic geometry. In the second, we discuss research articles focusing on minimal and CMC surfaces, leading to open questions in the matter. Some familiarity with the topic is expected, but appropriate references are provided to keep the material self-contained.",
