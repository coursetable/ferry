    "description": "This yearlong course (with GLBL 790) examines the practical execution of leadership in today\u2019s environment. Using a combination of historical case studies and recent events, we review how dramatic changes in technology, society, politics, media, and globalization have increased the complexity of the tasks facing modern leaders. Although the course includes the military aspects of leadership, the overall objective is to study leadership in a wider context, identifying the common factors shared by politics, business, education, warfare, and other fields. Specific topics include the changing leadership environment; the role of the leader; driving change; making difficult decisions; dealing with risk; coping with failure; navigating politics; and the effect of modern media.
