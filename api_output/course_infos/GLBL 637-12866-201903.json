    "description": "This course explores the United States\u2019 focus on security and counterterrorism at the expense of development assistance and questions if trade opportunities are being lost to the EU, Russia, and China. We examine the policy to counter extremist groups such as Boko Haram, ISIS, and the insurgent group al-Shabab, and the United States\u2019 military assistance to governments including but not limited to Chad, Djibouti, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Africa, and examine its effectiveness. We analyze the role of America\u2019s 4,000-troop multinational Djibouti-based Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa. Will it protect America and prevent terrorists\u2019 attacks, or is it doomed to failure?",
