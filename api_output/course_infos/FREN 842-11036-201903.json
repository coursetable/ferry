    "description": "In the words of the anthropologist Maurice Godelier, \u201csexuality is always something other than itself\u201d (a biological phenomenon), and it is sexuality\u2019s social and discursive constructions that we study in this seminar, through a large sample of texts from different genres. By crossing the approaches of gender studies, the history of emotions, and historical anthropology and literary analysis, we look at the abundant speech of sex that characterizes the Renaissance, where prohibition has had the value of incentive, as Michel Foucault has so clearly shown. Readings in erotic/pornographic poetry (Ronsard, Jodelle, Th\u00e9ophile de Viau), travel literature (Choli\u00e8res), self-portraiture (Montaigne), chronicles and anecdotes (Brant\u00f4me, Pierre de l\u2019Estoile), medical literature (Joubert, Par\u00e9, Duval), and short stories (Cent nouvelles nouvelles). Conducted in French.",
