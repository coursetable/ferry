    "description": "The words \u201cistoria\u201d and \u201chistoria\u201d are synonymous in art historical discourse with Leon Battista Alberti and the development of history painting over the centuries following the publication of\u00a0Della pittura. Yet even for Alberti, \u201chistoria\u201d referred neither exclusively to the medium of painting nor even to works of art; it also evoked the humanistic recovery of the past and the historiographical challenges that attended it. The writing of history and the \u201cimaging\u201d of history were closely entwined in early modernity, and increasingly so as the emergent pursuits of antiquarians and naturalists demanded recourse to visual evidence. Taking its title from Francis Haskell\u2019s seminal\u00a0History and Its Images\u00a0(1993), this seminar explores the polyvalence of \u201chistoria\u201d in the early modern art and intellectual culture, spanning from illuminated manuscripts to illustrations in printed treatises, and from painting to objects like coins and medals. We focus on close reading of primary sources from Pliny the Elder to early modern theorists as we explore the shifting meaning and application of the term from the early fifteenth to the early seventeenth century. Visits to collections on campus and a field trip to New York City further invite consideration of how theory manifests in practice.",
