    "description": "The goal of this course is to provide an interdisciplinary approach to learning about obesity as a biological and social phenomenon. We use biology as a scaffolding to understand obesity, yet also discuss the social, cultural, and psychological elements that shape our relationship with food and body size. The course focuses on three perspectives: the biological pathways over the lifetime that lead to obesity, the evolutionary origin of obesity, and the cross-cultural and societal meanings of obesity. Briefly, topics include adipose tissue as a regulatory and endocrine organ, human body composition variation in differing ecologies, the developmental origins of obesity, efficacy of obesity interventions, and political economies\u2019 influence on obesity. This class has a \u201cleminar\u201d format, in which lectures are mixed with active, student-centered, in-class discussions.",
