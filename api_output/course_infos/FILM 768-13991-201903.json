    "description": "The Vienna of 1900\u2014of Freud, Schnitzler, Strauss, Hofmannsthal, Kraus, Musil, Mahler, Sch\u00f6nberg, Klimt, Schiele, and Wittgenstein\u2014has become the stuff of myth. For good reason: at the turn of the twentieth century, the capital of the multiethnic, multilingual Habsburg Empire became a focal point for experimentation in literature, fine art, architecture, music, film, psychology, and philosophy. In this course, we examine the relationship between aesthetic innovation and psychoanalysis as well as between representation and language. We also look at the fin-de-si\u00e8cle\u2019s powerful afterlife and its subsequent mythologization. How do the artists of the time speak about the pressures of urbanization, secularization, ethnic conflict, cosmopolitanism, sexuality, gender, and consciousness? Continuing into the interwar period, we delve into the collapse of empire and its ramifications for architecture, urban planning, and artistic representation. The post-1918 period, leading up to the rise of fascism in the early 1930s, witnessed the emergence of progressive social ideals in the public sphere, from childcare to public housing projects. Women writers move to the forefront as chroniclers and analysts of squalid living conditions, rising anti-Semitism, and gender disparities. In addition, this course allows us to explore issues of temporality, ethnicity, and media (such as the serialized publication of literary texts, the proliferation of cinemas, and the development of the telephone network).",
