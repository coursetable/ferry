    "description": "The idea of human freedom is a central theme of history, but it is also a central problem of historical method. This course surveys attempts in philosophy, literature, and historiography to address three questions. Where does historical reconstruction end and the imponderable begin? In what measure does the endeavor of history itself depend upon a protective notion of individual freedom?\u00c2\u00a0How should the historian navigate between writing as an expression of individuality and writing as self-restraint?",
