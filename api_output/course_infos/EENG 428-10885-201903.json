    "description": "This course is an intermediate to advanced level course focusing on digital design and use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In addition, it centers around the new computing paradigm of Cloud FPGAs, where the FPGAs are hosted remotely by cloud providers and accessed remotely by users. The theoretical aspects of the course focus on digital system modeling and design using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL). In the course, students learn about logic synthesis, behavioral modeling, module hierarchies, combinatorial and sequential primitives, and implementing and testing the designs in simulation and real FPGAs. Students also learn about FPGA tools from two major vendors: for Xilinx FPGAs and Intel FPGAs (formerly Altera). The practical aspects focus on designing systems using commercial Cloud FPGA infrastructures: Amazon F1 service (Xilinx FPGAs) or through the Texas Advanced Computing Center (Intel FPGAs). Students learn about cloud computing, interfacing servers to FPGAs, PCIe and AXI protocols, and how to write software that runs on the cloud servers and leverages the FPGAs for acceleration of various computations.\u00a0\u00a0\nPrerequisites: EENG 201 and 348 or permission of the instructor.
