    "description": "What is liberalism? And why do arguments about it stand at the epicenter of our political life? Is it a political idea (and what are ideas in politics, anyways?), or is it a philosophy that tries to carve out a space apart from high politics\u2014and is that even possible? Is it about rights, or about equality? Is it about freedom and liberty, or laws and regulations? (And why are these dichotomies anyways)? Is it ancient? Is it modern? Can we even define what liberalism means, or does the attempt to do so in some way even miss the point?\u00a0This class is a historical, philosophical, and political examination of one of the most important and contested ideas in the modern world. We read both critics and advocates of liberalism. We also examine it historically, sociologically, and comparatively, in order to gain a better sense of what it means in practice, and how that differs from the theories of both some of it\u2019s most strong supporters and defenders, and critics. Special attention is paid to the development of the ethos and examples of liberalism. This course is also be a meditation on how to study politics and political theory. What does liberalism mean, and how should we examine it? Where did it come from, and how has it changed over time?",
