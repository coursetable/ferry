    "description": "More than 600 million Muslims live in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh\u2014South Asia\u2014which is approximately one-third of the Global Muslim community. From its origins in Arabia, Islam expanded across the globe and took deep root in diverse societies across Asia and Africa over the past 1,400 years. In this class, we explore the cultural and political dynamics of Islamization and vernacularization as themes of global Islamic history with particular reference to developments in South Asia. While South Asia is one of the main focal points of this course, connections and entanglements with neighboring regions, by land and sea, are explored thematically throughout the course. In particular, we look at the Ottoman and Safavid empires to the west, and the Indian Ocean world, including South East Asia. This vast region was diverse, in terms of language, religion, economic and social class, geography, and political leanings. Over this period, mobility, trade, communication, and exchange increased, resulting in more wealth accumulation and distribution; growth of knowledge production and exchange of ideas and books; better infrastructure, construction of buildings and cities, forts, and ports; and improved technology. Major topics include the spread of Islam, the development of vernacular Muslim cultures and its influence on the arts\u2014including music, the rise of regional sultanates and empires, women, the impact of and reaction to European colonialism, the debate about the decline of Muslim empires, and finally the creation of modern nation-states and Muslims in non-Muslim majority countries.",
