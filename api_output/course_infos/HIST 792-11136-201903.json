    "description": "This seminar provides a venue for writing a substantial research paper that crosses national borders in terms of perspective, analysis, and/or sources. We read some exemplary works of international and transnational history, as well as a number of methodological articles. The bulk of the course focuses on individual research projects that are workshopped in various ways through the term. While the United States figures prominently in the course, students may conduct research on transnational topics from any geography in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.",
