    "description": "Exploration of forms of love and desire in Victorian literature, with attention to their philosophical, historical, and aesthetic contexts. How history licensed or constrained the Victorian erotic imagination; how the pleasures of reading and looking shaped nineteenth-century aesthetics; how desire drives literary genres such as the sonnet sequence, the sensation novel, elegy, the love letter, aestheticist prose. Authors may include Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, William Morris, Christina Rossetti, Walter Pater, Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake), Michael Field, and Oscar Wilde, with additional readings in Sappho, Dante, Hegel, Stendhal, and Freud.\u00c2\u00a0Visits to the Yale art collections inform discussion.",
