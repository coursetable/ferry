    "description": "Law and Political Economy (20260). 2 units, credit/fail. This seminar will examine the relationship between the economy and political life, with particular attention to the role of law in mediating the relationship between the two. We will begin with key theoretical readings that articulate the embeddedness of the economy in politics (e.g., Polanyi), and that critique the conception of efficiency as a politically neutral value (e.g., Anderson, Dworkin). Early readings will also consider how literatures on racial capitalism and social reproduction contribute to our understanding of political economy. We will then pivot to consider recent legal scholarship across a range of fields that seeks to bring questions of political economy to the center, and thereby to make our legal and social order more just, equal, democratic, and sustainable. Topics include the political economy of the U.S. Constitution, of trade law, of the carceral state, and of work and labor law. At the end of the course, time will be allocated for topics that students identify as important to their own research agendas or to emerging political events. The course is credit/fail, based on class participation. Students seeking graded credits may add a third unit and complete a seminar paper by the end of the examination period. The paper option must be elected by September 13. Enrollment limited to thirty. Permission of the instructor required. A. Kapczynski.\n\nCourse Bidding: In addition to listing this course among permission-of-the-instructor selections, students should use the weighted-ranking system to indicate their ranked bid for the course, and they should also submit 500 words or less describing their interest in the course and any relevant experience or course work.
