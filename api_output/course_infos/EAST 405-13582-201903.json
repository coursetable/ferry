    "description": "This course is an overview of Korean Neo-Confucianism, a reformed form of traditional Confucianism, which constitutes a core part of Korean history. It was a driving force in the development and refinement of Korean thought and culture and, even today, remains influential in society. Historically, it is undeniable that Neo-Confucianism was an ideology used to solidify social status, suppressing commoners and women in pre-modern Korea. It is also blamed for nepotism and other corrupt practices. However, it has recently been reinterpreted as a major factor for the rapid adoption of modernization. In this course, we consider all negative and positive aspects of the tradition from theoretical, historical, thematic, and comparative perspectives. Students explore theoretical aspects of Neo-Confucianism, especially as they relate to cosmology, human nature, and its encounter with other religions. After delving into its theoretical foundation, students deal with thematic issues, such as women and gender, ideology, ecology, education, and others. Students are given an array of readings, ranging from philosophical and religious documents, diaries, and letters, to important recent scholarly works in the field, as well as visual sources to help foster a comprehensive understanding.\u00c2\u00a0No prior knowledge is required of Confucianism and Korean culture.",
