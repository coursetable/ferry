    "description": "Cell phones, twitter accounts, human genetic sequencing, trade figures, Web content, video surveillance, drone-collected bits and bytes, national security, and investigative sifting have generated a massive and ever-growing torrent of information. The term \u201cbig data\u201d has recently been coined to capture this shift in the way we live and think. This course defines big data, investigates big data analytical and visualization methods, and explores implications of big data analyses on a variety of sectors including global policy, human trafficking, national security, global capitalism, and global health and finance.",
