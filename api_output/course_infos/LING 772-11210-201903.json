    "description": "The only way a finite brain can produce an unlimited number of novel thoughts is by storing a finite system. It is proposed that part of this system is a large collection of stored parts, which we call \u201cconcepts\u201d and which are further combined and recombined via predetermined principles. In order to allow us to express our thoughts, our finite brain must also include a system of associating combinations of concepts with combinations of words and sentences. In this seminar we investigate proposals and empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, linguistics, and cognitive neuroscience, seeking to explain this connection between the ways we combine our concepts and the ways we combine our words and phrases.",
