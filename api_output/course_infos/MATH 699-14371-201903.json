    "description": "Expander graphs are playing a fundamental role in various areas of computer science and, in the past two decades, in pure mathematics. In recent years a theory of high dimensional expanders has emerged. This series of talks gives a brief account of this theory (a suitable preparation for those interested in attending the three-day workshop on \u201cHigh Dimensional Expanders\u201d at the Simons Foundation in New York City, Oct. 23\u201325). The course runs from Sept. 9 to Oct. 18. The lectures cover the following topics (approximately two meetings per topic): (1) a brief survey of expander graphs and Ramanujan graphs; (2) geometric and topological expanders (Gromov\u2019s overlapping property); (3) cohomological methods and coboundary expanders; (4) property testing and applications to computer science; (5) Garland method and Ramanujan complexes. The lectures try to assume only minimal background and intend to give a panoramic view of the area. They are suitable to math and computer science graduate students.",
