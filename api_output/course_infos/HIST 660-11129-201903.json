    "description": "This reading seminar examines the history of twentieth-century Europe through recent scholarship that employs a range of methods and styles. Rather than attempting to establish a historiographical canon, the course offers an introduction to major themes that have occupied historians of this period and geography. After exploring the defining questions of the nineteenth century in order to understand the longer roots of many concerns of the twentieth, we turn to the topics of migration, war, revolution, anti-Semitism, democracy, the Cold War, decolonization, multiculturalism, and neoliberalism.",
