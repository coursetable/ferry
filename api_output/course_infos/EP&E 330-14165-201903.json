    "description": "For centuries, \u201cbusiness\u201d activities\u2014such as profit-making, capital investment, and trading\u2014were seen with a distrustful eye by many members of society for prioritizing greed over virtue and religion. The aim of this course is to cast light on this tension in contemporary culture by critically examining the ethical dilemmas that arise from the interaction between capitalism and business actors in a liberal society. The chief question that guides our inquiry is how the incentive structure of market exchange encourages businesses to commodify social relations in a way that raises moral questions about the pursuit of profit.\u00a0We begin by defining \u201cethics\u201d and \u201cbusiness.\u201d We then explore the traditional tensions between them in the history of political and economic thought by surveying a number of key thinkers that have drawn attention to the fraught relation between markets and morality. Next we address some of the important contemporary debates and controversies surrounding business ethics, including corporate social responsibility, sweatshops, outsourcing, public accommodations, and the use of consumer data. Each week introduces a new theme, but the intent is for the themes to flow logically throughout the course in a manner that integrates and synthesizes the prior week\u2019s readings and discussion. We conclude by connecting our study of business ethics to our wider understanding of the proper role of business and capitalist enterprise in society as a whole.",
