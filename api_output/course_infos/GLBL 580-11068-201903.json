    "description": "This course explores the evolution of information warfare as a national security threat to the United States. Beginning with the KGB\u2019s use of \u201cactive measures\u201d during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion and impact. Using Russia\u2019s efforts in the 2016 election as an example, students examine the legal limitations on the FBI and intelligence community\u2019s ability to counter such operations in the United States and explore potential policy solutions in the realm of intelligence tools, privacy laws, Internet regulation, and human \u201csocial capital.\u201d Guest speakers include information warfare expert Molly McKew, Russian CIA officer John Sipher, producers of the recent documentary Active Measures, and others.",
