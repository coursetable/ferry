    "description": "Why should a long book be an airport novel or an old classic? What are today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sagas or romans-fleuves? In this seminar, we read \"great\" novels of the 21st-century in both senses of the word: these fictions are long and acclaimed works of art. If our current attention span is supposed to be eight seconds, this course is a workshop to develop different forms of paying attention to a text. We discuss the influence of length on our reading and interpretation practices. There won't be more pages to read every week than in any other course, just fewer texts. We read two long contemporary fictions by Antoine Volodine and Nina Yargekov.",
