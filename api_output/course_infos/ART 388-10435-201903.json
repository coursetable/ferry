    "description": "Screen-based works\u2014film, video, television, projection and computer technologies\u2014embody heuristic techniques that formulate, propagate, and disseminate experience, information, and knowledge to viewers. The screen, picture, and image are interdependent components of moving-image production\u2014at once, intra-active, interactive, interdependent, and interwoven. This course analyzes and implements the practical application of screen content production, while exploring the tangible, fungible, and palpable intermix of affect and effect of these two-dimensional surfactants. Working within the terms of Susan Sontag\u2019s proposal of an \u2018ecology of images,\u2019\u00a0as outlined in her 1977 seminal work On Photography, we experiment within an environment in which producers are repatriated as\u00a0actants-in-presentia. Analysis and diagnosis of our moving image-laden\u00a0condition strives towards an understanding of where we are, and perhaps, where we are to go.\u00a0\nPrerequisite: ART 138, 142 or 145, or permission of the instructor.",
