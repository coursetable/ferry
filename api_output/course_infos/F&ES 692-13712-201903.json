    "description": "This course explores the science and practices of temperate agroforestry, covering current knowledge of agroforestry science and shedding light on the myths and assumptions that have yet to be\u00a0tested regarding the integration of trees in agricultural systems. The course begins with an overview\u00a0of modern agriculture to help us better understand why agroforestry systems have potential to improve\u00a0the sustainability of farming systems. We also cover the social science regarding agroforestry and why it has not been widely adopted. Silvopasture and forest farming systems are the primary focus, but windbreaks, alley cropping, and riparian forest buffers are also covered. The field of agroforestry\u00a0has struggled with the promotion of hypothetical practices; this course introduces students to real-world\u00a0production agroforestry systems and helps them better contribute to financially viable and\u00a0environmentally sound agricultural operations.",
