    "description": "A detailed examination of the development of painting in Florence in the late Medieval period, from about 1250 to about 1420. Based primarily on the collections of the Yale Art Gallery, supplemented by private and public collections in New York, the course examines conventional approaches to period historicization, alternative hypotheses based on new technical and forensic evidence, and the lingering influence of nationalist polemics in scholarly interpretation.",
