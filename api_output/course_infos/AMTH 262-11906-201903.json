    "description": "Introduction to the core ideas and principles that arise in modern data analysis, bridging statistics and computer science and providing students the tools to grow and adapt as methods and techniques change. Topics include principle component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning, neural networks and optimization, as well as scalable computing for large datasets. Assignments will include implementation, data analysis and theory.\u00a0Students require background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability and programming.\nPrerequisites: after or concurrently with\u00a0MATH 222,\u00a0225, or\u00a0231; after or concurrently with\u00a0MATH 120,\u00a0230, or\u00a0ENAS 151; after or concurrently with\u00a0CPSC 100,\u00a0112, or\u00a0ENAS 130; after S&DS 100-108 or S&DS 230 or S&DS 241 or S&DS 242.",
