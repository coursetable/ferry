    "description": "This course covers computational methods that commonly arise when simulating physics in movies, games, and computational fabrication. In particular, we learn state-of-the-art methods for simulating fluids (fire and water) and solids (muscles, clothing, and skin). The algorithms discussed span offline techniques suitable for movies and fabrication, as well as real-time techniques for games. We cover finite difference and finite element representations as well as solver practicalities such as conjugate gradients, preconditioning, and Newton iteration.\nPrerequisites: linear algebra, Newtonian physics, and two terms of programming. Some familiarity with C, C++, or Java is assumed. Previous experience with computer graphics is preferred, but not required.",
