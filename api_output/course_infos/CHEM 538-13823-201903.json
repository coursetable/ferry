    "description": "This course reinforces the principles of physics that are most relevant to experimental and theoretical physical chemistry. These include classical\u00a0electricity and magnetism (with emphasis on the nature of light and the interaction of light with matter), optics, lasers, angular momentum, and atomic\u00a0structure, including the spin-orbit interaction. The basic theme of the course is to provide students with physical intuition that can bridge the observations of everyday experience to the abstract concepts required for the correct, quantum-mechanical description of atomic-scale phenomena.\nPrerequisites: two terms of undergraduate physical chemistry (CHEM 328 or CHEM 332, and CHEM 333; or equivalents); physics course work covering classical mechanics and electrostatics; and one course in multivariable calculus.",
