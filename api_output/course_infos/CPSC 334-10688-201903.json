    "description": "Ubiquitous computing is creating new canvases and opportunities for creative ideas. This class explores the use of microprocessors, distributed sensor networks, IoT, and intermedia systems for the purposes of creative expression.\u00a0The course is delivered in a mixed lecture and lab format that introduces the fundamental concepts and theory behind embedded systems as well as issues particular to their creative employment. The key objective of the course is for students to conceive of and implement creative uses of computation. To this end, skills to be obtained during the course are as follows: (1) appreciate the current efforts and motivation to push the limitations of computation for creative expression, both in new application and new foundational research; (2) weigh factors such as cost, power, processing, memory, I/O capabilities, and networking capabilities when choosing a set of embedded devices and sensors; (3) contextualize unfamiliar hardware and languages through examples, documentation, and familiar design pattern; and (4) manage communication between multiple languages, devices, and protocols.\u00a0Additionally, at the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their work in the form of writing, code, video, audio, and physical artifacts.\nPrerequisite: CPSC 223 or equivalent or by permission of instructor.",
