    "description": "This course explores how American policymakers have used or misused history in making foreign policy decisions since World War I. In addition to the course readings on this topic, students examine the archives of American diplomats and policymakers behind those decisions. Students are introduced to the vast archival holdings of the Yale Library in diplomatic and international history, and are expected to use archival collections in their assignments. We discuss historical methods and the process of archival research alongside the history of 20th century American foreign policy.",
