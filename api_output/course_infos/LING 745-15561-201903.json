    "description": "This course explores the structure of the syllable in various languages and theories. Students read primary literature on the evidence for and against syllables as a phonological unit, including evidence from stress patterns, phonotactics, sonority, language games, and allomorphy. Students also explore different theories of subsyllabic structure. The course culminates in a final paper, where students are encouraged to apply one or more of the theories discussed in class to original data or research.\nPrerequisite: LING 632; LING 635 is recommended, but not required.",
