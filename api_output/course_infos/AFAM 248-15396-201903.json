    "description": "Less than a century old, television is one of the youngest but most influential mediums to shape politics, pop culture, and American society. For years, scholars, critics, and fans looked back at the sitcoms and dramas made between 1947-1960 as representative of a \u201cGolden Age of Television\u201d that engaged with a changing society that followed the trauma of World War II. Decades later, in the early 2000s, premium cable shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Oz suggested that a new Golden Age of Television had arrived. This course pairs these two eras of television to ask: Are there similarities between these two eras of television? How do these stories, represented visually on television, relate to the world outside of the screen? How has the rise of streaming reconfigured our viewing habits and the ways that we understand the world? By looking at two eras of television we work to see what some of the major tropes or threads are, and understand how certain shows that are considered a part of either \u201cGolden Age of Television\u201d create meaning and interest in viewers. Programs include: I Love Lucy, Roots, The Twilight Zone, The Wire, Deadwood, and How to Get Away with Murder.",
