    "description": "This course introduces Newtonian mechanics as an aid in predicting the behavior of moving scenery. Theoretical performance calculations are developed to approximate the actual performance of stage machinery. Topics include electric motors, gearing, friction, and ergonomics.\nOpen to nondepartmental and non-School of Drama students with prior permission of the instructor.",
