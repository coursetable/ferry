    "description": "Senior Chemistry majors engage individual experimental and/or theoretical research problems in the laboratories of a selected faculty member in the Chemistry department or in a closely related field of molecular science. CHEM 490 registration forms, found in the DUS office, must be signed by the student\u2019s faculty research mentor and submitted it to the Chemistry DUS for final approval no later than the last week of classes in the immediately preceding academic term. Mandatory class meetings address issues of essential laboratory safety and ethics in science, with other class sessions focusing on core topics of broad interest to Chemistry students, including online literary research, oral presentation skills, and effective scientific writing. At least ten hours of research are required per week. Students are assigned letter grades, subject to restrictions imposed by Yale College. In special cases and with DUS approval, juniors may take this course.\u2002",
