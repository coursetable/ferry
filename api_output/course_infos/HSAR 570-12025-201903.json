    "description": "Marguerite Yourcenar\u2019s famed fictional Memoirs of Hadrian serves as the starting point for an exploration of Hadrian and the art he commissioned in Rome and abroad. Hadrian\u2019s passion for life, quest after peace, romantic wanderlust, veneration of Greek culture, and craving for love, along with his acceptance of death\u2019s inexorableness, led him to commission some of Rome\u2019s greatest monuments. The emperor\u2019s flair for leadership and talent as an amateur architect inform student projects on the sculpture, mosaics, and buildings of the age, among them the portraiture of Hadrian\u2019s lover Antinous, the Pantheon, and Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Britain.\nQualified undergraduates who have taken HSAR 250a and/or HSAR 252a may be admitted with permission of the instructor.",
