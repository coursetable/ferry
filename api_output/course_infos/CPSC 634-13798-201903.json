    "description": "This course combines seminar-style readings and discussions with practical, hands-on development of a term-long project. Students read a selection of papers to get both a historical perspective and exposure to current research in networking. Students write reviews of the papers to make sure everyone keeps up with the readings and to develop their (technical) communication skills. Throughout the term, students work in teams to develop a fully functional IP router. Students design the control plane in Python on a Linux host and design the data plane in the new P4 language. Teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the those of the other teams by building a small topology utilizing everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s router. At the end of the course, teams participate in an open-ended design challenge.\nPrerequisite: undergraduate networking.",
