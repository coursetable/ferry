    "description": "Comparative focus on vertebrate animals and how individual organisms survive in their environments and how species deal with common problems (respiration, energy acquisition, reproduction) using similar, or sometimes very different, tools. Additional topics include specialized adaptations to extreme environments from high altitude to the deep seas and physiological mechanisms that facilitate survival at multiple levels: cells, tissues, organs, systems, and whole organisms.\nPrerequisites: BIOL 101, 102 and CHEM 161, or permission of the instructor.",
