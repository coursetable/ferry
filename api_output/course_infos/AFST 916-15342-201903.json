    "description": "The most significant religious change in our time is the axial shift of mass and direction of the center of Christianity from North America and Europe to Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific. In 1900 more than 80 percent of professing Christians were white and Euro-American. Today more than 60 percent of professing Christians live in areas in the non-Western world. The course surveys Christianity in its different cultural, geographical, and historical growth and expressions from the Jewish, Hellenistic, Early African (Coptic), Latin, Northern European, and now Global South manifestations. The serial, rather than progressive, growth of Christianity is highlighted. Particular attention is paid to indigenous agency in the translation and appropriation of Christianity in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The rise and expansion of Islam and its impact on the trajectory of Christian history and thought are examined.",
