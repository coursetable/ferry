    "description": "This seminar explores the role Gothic architecture has played in modern cultural imaginary from the 18th century onward to its current use in popular culture. We explore the style\u2019s origins in philosophy, literature, and painting and its application to different media and its influence on our thinking about the creation and experience of art and architecture. We also consider whether Gothic style is constituted by particular type of structural and material logic or by certain type of aesthetic sensibility and atmosphere. Students\u00a0use Yale\u2019s collegiate Gothic campus as a primary case study and James Gamble Rogers papers in Manuscripts and Archives in the Yale University Library as primary source material to explore these topics. Sterling Memorial Library and Payne Whitney Gymnasium\u2014respectively the most modern library and the largest gymnasium in the world\u2014are studied and analyzed in detail. The seminar considers the heated debates surrounding the completion of these buildings, and consider whether in its current use, the style should be considered a sign of anachronism and cultural anxiety or a model for an experimental and multi-medial approach to architecture and design.",
