    "description": "\u201c\u2018Transform the world,\u2019 said Marx, \u2018change life,\u2019 said Rimbaud; these two mottoes are for us one and the same.\u201d With this mandate, the French poet and author Andr\u00e9 Breton established the revolutionary ambitions of Surrealism, an avant-garde movement founded in France in the 1920s. Yet how exactly did Surrealism propose to merge psychological and political revolutions? This course sets out to answer this question by mining Surrealism\u2019s central artistic strategies and critical operations, from automatism and chance procedures to radical experiments with the novel, sculpture, photography, film, and exhibition format. A significant portion of coursework emerges from Surrealist exercises. Class meetings and assignments engage with Yale\u2019s art collections and archives.",
