    "description": "Continuous optimization has played a major role in the recent development of fast algorithms for problems arising in areas such as theoretical computer science, discrete optimization, and machine learning. The approach is to first formulate the problem as a continuous optimization problem, even if the problem may be over a discrete domain, adapt or develop deterministic or randomized continuous-time dynamical systems to solve it, and then design algorithms for the problem via appropriate discretizations. The goal of this course is to design state-of-the-art algorithms for various classical discrete problems through the use of continuous optimization/sampling. The algorithmic applications include shortest paths, bipartite matching, flows, linear programming, sampling, and counting. We present approaches including gradient descent, mirror descent, multiplicative weights update method, accelerated gradient descent, Riemannian descent, Newton\u2019s method, cutting-plane methods, Langevin dynamics, and Hamiltonian dynamics.\nPrerequisites: solid background in calculus, linear\u00a0algebra, probability, and algorithms; S&DS 630 is recommended.
