    "description": "This is not a programming course or a mathematics course. The course provides an in-depth survey of the data standards, data analysis tools, databases, and information management systems and applications used in clinical population research, disease surveillance, emergency response information systems, and the like. It examines informatics techniques used on population-level data to improve health and the application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, policy, and decision support. This scientific area focuses on the capture, management, and use of electronic public health data. While these backgrounds are prominent in the field, the purpose of this course is to provide the history and context of the field.",
