    "description": "Whispered, spoken or stuttered, language untethers narrative, emotion, form. Object Poetic(s) looks to the speculative ecologies of poetry as so many invitations for process and composition. Under the influence of materiality or movement, what possibilities for writing and performance arise? How might strategies of repetition, discontinuity, rhythm, horizontality, or translation move from syntax to fabrication or form? Poetry exposes writing as process, engaging language as a threshold to elaborate the transitive and aleatory textures of form through affect. Writing of a new metabolic capacity of form, philosopher Catherine Malabou describes plasticity as a syncretic relation that pushes aesthetic ideas of poesis and form through deconstruction and destruction to incite something more transitive and ghostly, dissonant and even fantastic. Aristotle\u2019s poesis becomes unhinged again as Denise Ferreira da Silva notes in her thinking on poethics. Under the influence of Renee Gladman, Rosmarie Waldrop, Claudia Rankine, Maggie Nelson, Nathana\u00ebl, Julia Kristeva, D.W. Winnicott, Andr\u00e9 Green, Kristin Prevallet, Miguel Gutierrez, Jacques Derrida, C.A. Conrad, Lyn Hejinian, Simone White, Sianne Ngai, as opening examples, we will discuss the potential of plasticity and poetics as spaces of writing and making. Each seminar will include conversation, writing, and improvisational experiments extending from the readings.",
