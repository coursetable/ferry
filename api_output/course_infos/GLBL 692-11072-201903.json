    "description": "This seminar addresses the domestic political considerations that have affected American foreign policy in the post-World War II world. The goals are to give historical context to the formation of major existing global governance structures, give students an opportunity to research how major foreign policy decisions in the past were influenced by contemporary political pressure, and assess what effect those pressures have had on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global issues. Case studies include but are not limited to Truman and the Marshall Plan; Johnson and the Vietnam War; Nixon and the opening of China; Reagan and the collapse of the Soviet Union; George H.W. Bush and Iraq; Clinton and the Balkans; and Obama and the development of a multipolar foreign policy for a multipolar world. Students assume the role of decision-makers under political pressure and are asked to generate a point of view regarding past, present, and future foreign policy decisions.",
