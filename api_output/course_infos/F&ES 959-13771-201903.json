    "description": "In this course, interdisciplinary student teams carry out applied public health research or practice projects in the areas of environmental/climate justice, climate change, sustainability, and public health. Each team works with a sponsoring organization (e.g., unit within Yale, local health department, state agency, community organization, other nongovernmental organization). The course affords the opportunity to apply concepts and competencies learned in the classroom to these important areas. It should be of interest to students across the University, from the Schools of Public Health and Forestry & Environmental Studies to Yale College juniors and seniors. In addition, it is one of the options available to Public Health students to fulfill the practice requirement for the M.P.H. degree.",
