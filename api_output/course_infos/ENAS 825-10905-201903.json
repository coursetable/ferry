    "description": "The physics of chemical measurements performed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, with special emphasis on applications to measurement studies in living tissue. Concepts that are common to magnetic resonance imaging are introduced. Topics include safety, equipment design, techniques of spectroscopic data analysis, and metabolic modeling of dynamic spectroscopic measurements.",
