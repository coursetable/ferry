    "description": "Limited to M.F.A. sculpture students. Critique of sculpture, time-based media, and ungainly projects. Students present their work in two venues. Throughout the year a full ensemble of the sculpture faculty and students meet weekly for critiques in which each student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work is reviewed at least once per term. In addition, during the fall term only, a more intimate in-depth weekly critique takes place in two sections, each limited to eleven students and led by either Martin Kersels or Sandra Burns. There is no singular focus in this smaller critique, as the balance of pragmatic and conceptual considerations surrounding the work is examined and discussed in a fluid way depending on the work at hand and the intent of the artist.",
