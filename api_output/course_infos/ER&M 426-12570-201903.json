    "description": "This course explores how history, culture, and power shape our conceptualization of the world and its peoples. By critically examining how social categories\u2014such as culture, religion, race, economy, and ideology\u2014have been mapped onto different parts of the world, the course traces how legacies of colonialism and imperialism in Africa continue to inform contemporary perspectives of economic development, geopolitics, and globalization. Students consider the history of world categorizations through the perspectives of the people who mobilized to transform them, from anti-colonial fighters and postcolonial scholars to the Third World solidarity movement and contemporary African activists and artists.\u00a0",
