    "description": "This seminar considers the ideological, historical, and cultural debates on globalization relative to the production of contemporary art. A typical shorthand on globalization describes a historical compression in time-space relations\u2014the social acceleration of time and a virtual eclipse of distance\u2014continuous with the liberalization of markets, the fall of the Soviet Union, postwar decolonization movements, and the expansion of global communication technologies. As the most important curatorial and art-critical rubric of the last two decades, globalization has had a transformative impact on the art world, including its markets, audiences, and actors. Our goal is to consider not only the iconography of globalism as represented within and by contemporary practice but also a more fundamental relationship between aesthetics, politics, and recent art. Topics include controversies over periodization and their implications for postcolonial, neocolonial, and postcommunist histories; art and agency in the era of the network society; the spatial politics of contemporary art in an \u201caspatial\u201d (Massey) era; the critique of representation through theories of immanence, the multitude, and the biopolitical (Hardt and Negri, Agamben, Foucault); labor and precarity.\nOpen only to Ph.D. students, with priority given to art history students working on modern and contemporary art; enrollment restricted and by permission of the instructor. No auditors.",
