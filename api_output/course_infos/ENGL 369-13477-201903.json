    "description": "This seminar explores the diverse cultural manifestations of war, empire, and militarism in Asia and the Pacific during the long Cold War (roughly the 1940s-1980s). A portion of the course is devoted to iconic literary and cultural figures who came to prominence through cultures of militarism (e.g., Jade Snow Wong, James Michener, C.Y. Lee, Richard Mason, Epeli Hau\u02bbofa). We consider important genres privileged by cultural imperialism and soft power (e.g., autobiography, travel writing). We also read more faddish and less canonical writers (e.g., Kim Yong Ik, Induk Pahk, Janice Mirikitani, Maria Yen) and engage stranger and more ephemeral cultural objects (e.g., advertisements, fashion magazines, tourist guidebooks). Important topics for the course include refugee migration, the model minority, global education reform, and the belated resurgence of reparation movements. We conclude the semester by examining the Asian American Movement of the 1960s and the publication of Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s The Woman Warrior in 1975.",
