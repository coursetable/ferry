    "description": "In this performance workshop/seminar we look to the body (our bodies) as a way of understanding the material world, as a means of production, and as a potential subject. Through readings, screenings, experiential exercises, experiments and conversation, we\u2019ll examine perception, the senses, time and consciousness, our relationship to both natural and constructed space, interaction with other bodies, and the metaphoric body\u2014political and biological. This class aims to encourage development of individual performative methodologies to inform (and perhaps alter) the nature of each student\u2019s current artistic practice. Over the course of term, students will conceptualize and present several performance experiments and one fully realized final project.",
