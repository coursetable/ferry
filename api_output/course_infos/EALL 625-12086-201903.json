    "description": "What is the appeal and the aesthetic concept of the Classical Chinese poetic form, which began in classical antiquity and continued to serve as a primary medium for poetic expression in modern times? How did modern writers express their \u201cnew\u201d voices by using this \u201cold\u201d form? The seminar traces the \u201cmodern\u201d development of Chinese classical poetry from the Revivalist (fugu) movement of the Ming to contemporary China in Shanghai. Emphasis on critical close reading, with attention to cultural and political contexts. Baihua translations and notes are provided for most of the poems. Primary readings in Chinese; discussion in English.",
