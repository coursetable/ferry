    "description": "Pit crits are the core of the program in painting/printmaking. The beginning of each weekly session is an all-community meeting with students, the DGS, graduate coordinator, and those faculty members attending the crit. Two hour-long critiques follow in the Pit; the fall term is devoted to developing the work of second-year students and the spring term to first-year students. A core group of faculty members as well as a rotation of visiting critics are present to encourage but not dominate the conversation: the most lively and productive critiques happen when students engage fully with each other. Be prepared to listen and contribute. Note: Pit crits are for current Yale students, staff, and invited faculty and guests only; no outside guests or audio/video recording are permitted.",
