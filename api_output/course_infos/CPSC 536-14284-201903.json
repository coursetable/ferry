    "description": "Interactions of computer architecture and systems software for high-performance systems. In particular, the focus is on advanced aspects of compilation, particularly program analysis, code generation, optimization (i.e., the back end of modern compilers). No prior exposure to compilers is assumed, but the front end (i.e., lexing, parsing, etc.) is covered only briefly, in as much as is needed for studying compilation back end. Hands-on exposure to programming projects using LLVM.",
