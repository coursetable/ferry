    "description": "Modernism emerged at the height of the imperialist era, and many of its major names were themselves implicated in imperialism, whether as agents of imperialist powers or through family connections. This course explores the role of imperialism in modernist culture and its relationship to exoticism. The approach is multidisciplinary, and the class looks at literary texts, films, and paintings. Works by Camus, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, Gauguin, Victor Segalen, Kafka, T.S. Eliot, Viktor Shklovsky, Fritz Lang, E.M. Forster, and Pierre Loti are among those discussed.",
