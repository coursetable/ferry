    "description": "After a brief review of hyperbolic geometry, we discuss various topics in dynamics on hyperbolic manifolds. Possible topics include: (1) Patterson-Sullivan theory; (2) mixing of geodesic flow and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure; (3) Apollonian gasket: equidistribution and counting problems; (4) prime geodesic theorems; (5) Margulis functions and applications; (6) measure rigidity and topological rigidity of unipotent group actions; (7) topological proof of Benoist-Quint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orbit closure theorem; (8) higher-rank Patterson-Sullivan theory.",
