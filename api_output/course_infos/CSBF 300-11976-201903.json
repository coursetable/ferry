    "description": "This composition workshop-style course is a generative laboratory to make rigorous, experimental works that open reflection on socio-political issues. Topics include a study of other artists' work and ways they engage with wide-ranging political matter through performance, animation, sculpture, and other media; an embodied exploration of compositional elements at different sites on Yale\u2019s campus; and creative assignments that employ various methods to interrogate sociopolitical material of your own choosing.\u00a0",
