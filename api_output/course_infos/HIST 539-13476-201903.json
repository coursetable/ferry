    "description": "An exploration of various aspects of books as they appeared and were experienced in early modern England. We focus on the material and institutional conditions that enabled, and sometimes inhibited, reading and writing in the period. We also work closely with actual volumes, with the aim of understanding not only the historical conditions shaping the production, circulation, and reception of books (not only printed books) but also what this understanding might contribute to our scholarly reconstructions of the period.",
