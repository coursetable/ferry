    "description": "Understanding the tools used in financial analysis is an important component of successful forestland investment and forest management decision-making. This course provides students with a basic suite\u00a0of financial tools used in the acquisition and management of forestland/timber. It includes an overview\u00a0of traditional financial analysis metrics used in land acquisition, timber management, and risk\u00a0management, and emerging trends in forestland investing. Concepts are reinforced through spreadsheet-based exercises, case studies, and guest speakers. Each week, one class session is devoted to concepts; the second session is devoted to applying these concepts by analyzing a\u00a0real-world deal, case study, or investment strategy, often presented by a guest speaker who is a\u00a0professional in the field.",
