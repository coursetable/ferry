    "description": "The goal of this course is to provide an interdisciplinary approach to learning about obesity as a biological and social phenomenon. We use biology as a scaffolding to understand obesity, yet also discuss the social, cultural, and psychological elements that shape our relationship with food and body size. The coursework focuses on three perspectives\u2014the biological pathways over the lifetime that lead to obesity, the evolutionary origin of obesity, and the cross-cultural and societal meanings of obesity. Briefly, topics include adipose tissue as a regulatory and endocrine organ, human body composition variation in differing ecologies, the developmental origins of obesity, efficacy of obesity interventions and political economies\u2019 influence on obesity. This class has a \u201cleminar\u201d format, in which lectures are mixed with active, student-centered, in-class discussions.\u00a0",
