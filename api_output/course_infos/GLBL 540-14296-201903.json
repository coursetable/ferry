    "description": "How can we save democracy in Venezuela? Are human rights once again under siege in Central America and Mexico? What type of constructive role can the United States play in the region? Democracy in Latin America has been a defining hemispheric principle for more than two hundred years. Equally important is the challenge nations face in their efforts to advance and promote universal human rights. Understanding the history of U.S. engagement in Latin America is critical to identifying new opportunities for political and economic development throughout the Western Hemisphere in the twenty-first century. All three elements\u2014democratic governance, respect for human rights, and U.S. diplomacy\u2014complement and at times conflict with current realities governments face from emerging demographic, commercial, and legal trends in their societies. This course provides a historical review of how all three elements have had an impact on the contemporary reality in key countries throughout the hemisphere. It compares the different democratic paths taken by Cuba and Venezuela since the late 1950s to understand better how they are now intertwined and out of step with the democratic trends in the rest of the hemisphere. We look at Mexico\u2019s human rights challenges as its political and legal institutions adapt to a growing middle class brought on by its economic growth over the past twenty-five years. In Central America, we examine how weak democratic governance is responsible for conditions that are driving large numbers of its citizens to leave the region. We also study the democratic transition in Chile, Argentina\u2019s dirty war, and Colombia\u2019s transition from a fragile failing state to leading U.S. ally in the region. Underlying every topic is a review of the United States\u2019 role in contributing to events. Although a review of the history informs our approaches, there is significant focus on current issues and potential policy options.",
