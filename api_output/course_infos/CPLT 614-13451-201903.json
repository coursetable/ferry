    "description": "The German Democratic Republic (1949\u201389) was a political and aesthetic experiment that failed, buffeted by external pressures and eroded by internal contradictions. For forty years, in fact, its most ambitious literary texts and films (some suppressed, others widely popular) explored such contradictions, often in a vigilant, Brechtian spirit of irony and dialectics. This course examines key texts both as aesthetic experiments and as critiques of the country\u2019s emerging cultural institutions and state censorship, recurrent political debates, and pressing social issues. Texts by Brecht, Uwe Johnson, Heiner M\u00fcller, Christa Wolf, Johannes Bobrowski, Franz F\u00fchmann, Wolf Biermann, Thomas Brasch, Christoph Hein; films by Slatan Dudow, Kurt Maetzig, Konrad Wolf, Heiner Carow, Frank Beyer, J\u00fcrgen B\u00f6ttcher, Volker Koepp.\nKnowledge of German desirable but not crucial; all texts available in English.",
