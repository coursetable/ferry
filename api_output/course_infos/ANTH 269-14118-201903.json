    "description": "Humans belong to the Hominoidea, a family of primates that also include the apes (gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos). The evolutionary history that we share with living apes, combined with our inability to study the behavior of extinct hominins (members of the human lineage since it diverged from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos) directly, makes comparative research on their anatomy, social behavior, ecology, and psychology highly relevant to many issues in the study of human evolution. This course provides an overview of ape evolution, ecology, and social behavior and uses this as background for addressing some of these issues. Examples include how research on apes contributes to reconstructions of the behavior and ecology of extinct hominins; what we can learn from chimpanzees about the importance of hunting and meat eating in human evolution; whether data on intergroup aggression in chimpanzees provides insights into human behavior, and why chimpanzee-bonobo contrasts are important; how studying communication informs us about communication in humans, and whether it tells us anything about language; whether chimpanzees have culture; and how research on ape cognition challenges or confirms claims for human uniqueness.",
