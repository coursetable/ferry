    "description": "A studio-based exploration of the epochal shift in choreographic aesthetics known as postmodern dance. In the early 1960s, a cohort of young artists redefined what dance could be and do. Influenced by the composer John Cage, these artists invented new movement vocabularies and compositional forms.\u00a0Through re-staging seminal dances from the 1960s and 1970s, we consider\u00a0the social and political contexts in which postmodern dance emerged; its links to minimalism, sculpture, and experimental music; and\u00a0its ongoing influence on twenty-first century global contemporary dance. The course includes a field trip to New York City to attend the reconstruction of Yvonne Rainer\u2019s dance\u00a0\u201cParts of Some Sextets\u201d (1965), which premieres in November in the Performa 19 Biennial.\u00a0This class is open to students of all physical abilities and backgrounds; special accommodations will be crafted in the event of specific disabilities.\u00a0",
