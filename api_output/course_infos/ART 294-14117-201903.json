    "description": "Inherent transformative qualities are embedded within technology; it transforms our lives, the way we perceive or make art, and conversely, art can reflect on these transformations. Students explore the implementation of technologies in their art making from pneumatic kinetics, to bioengineering, and works assisted by artificial intelligence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmodes of production that carry movement, degradation, and displacement of authorship. The student practice is supported by readings, independent research, and essays on diverse artists and designers who make use of technology in their work or, on the contrary, totally avoid it.
