    "description": "Climate change has the observable potential to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme\u00a0weather events such as hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, frosts, and floods. In response, many concerned citizens, communities, scientific consortia, industries, and governments around the\u00a0world have sought to address climate change for the sake of global well-being even while others\u00a0resist the realities of the threat. This course examines climate change effect management strategies: specifically, building resilience in places of acknowledged vulnerability against the grain of\u00a0philosophical and practical challenges. Environment and health-centered activities resulting from\u00a0thoughtful, interdisciplinary approaches and audits are held as the ideal among various\u00a0adaptive responses. Scope includes but is not limited to food, energy, and water security as\u00a0well as the readiness of health systems in the United States, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean. Throughout the term, students engage in readings of journal articles, lectures, discussions, and interactive exercises per themes and critical questions outlined in the syllabus. There are no prerequisites. Enrollment (capped at twenty-five) is open to Yale College juniors and seniors, graduate students, and other scholars.\nPermission of the instructors required.",
