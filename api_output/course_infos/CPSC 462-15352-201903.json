    "description": "An introduction to spectral graph theory motivated by computer science, covering advanced topics in linear algebra and exploring the combinatorial meaning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with graphs. Applications to optimization, numerical linear algebra, error-correcting codes, pseodorandomness, and the discovery of graph structure.\nPrerequisites: 1) Linear Algebra by MATH 222, 223 or 230 or 231; 2) Graph Theory by MATH 244 or CPSC 356 or 366; and 3) comfort with proof-based exposition and problem sets, such as is gained from MATH 230 and 231, or CPSC 366.",
