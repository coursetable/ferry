    "description": "Building on earlier course work in quantitative analysis and statistics, Policy Modeling provides an operational framework for exploring the costs and benefits of public policy decisions. The techniques employed include \"back of the envelope\" probabilistic models, Markov processes, queuing theory, and linear/integer programming. With an eye toward making better decisions, these techniques are applied to a number of important policy problems. In addition to lectures, assigned articles and text readings, and short problem sets, students are responsible for completing a take-home midterm exam and a number of cases. In some instances, it is possible to take a real problem from formulation to solution, and compare the student's own analysis to what actually happened.\nPrerequisites: Decision Analysis and Game Theory, Data Analysis and Statistics, or a demonstrated proficiency in quantitative methods.",
