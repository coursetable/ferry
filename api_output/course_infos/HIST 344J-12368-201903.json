    "description": "For many of us, oil defines Middle Eastern modernity. In fact it defines the Middle East\u2014its economies, its politics, its societies. Focusing on the parts of the Middle East now associated with oil, this course looks first at states and next at economies to ask what, who, and where was modern in the Middle East before oil? How has the Middle East participated in crafting the global modern? Considering issues of capital, empire, and technology, before ending with a discussion of some of the less-studied cultural aspects of oil modernity, the course ultimately asks us to consider what is special\u2014and not\u2014about the Middle East, and about oil.\u00a0Cultural and political material produced by individuals and states in the region\u2014from maps to music and diaries to film\u2014provide a variety of perspectives on the last years of empire in the region. The diverse economic, political, and technical responses Middle Eastern actors offered to European imperialism and global capital, and the ways those responses in turn shaped imperialism and capitalism, outline an unexpected Middle Eastern modernity.",
