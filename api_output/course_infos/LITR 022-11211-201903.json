    "description": "This seminar explores\u00a0the rivalry\u00a0between music and literature, the attraction and repulsion between these two art forms, and the dialogue between writers and composers. In select fiction and poetry spanning a variety of cultures and times, we look at\u00a0the aesthetic challenges of\u00a0conveying music in words; in select music from the same periods, we study the use of literary themes and narrative. How does music inhabit literature, and literature influence music? We read fiction describing music and borrowing musical forms; we study symphonies and opera inspired by literature; we look at films that bring together these two arts. Students examine theoretical approaches and learn comparative methods useful for literature and culture courses. Though not required,\u00a0musical experience and/or interest is welcomed for the seminar, which may be taken simultaneously with gateway courses in the humanities.\u00a0Enrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.",
