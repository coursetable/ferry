    "description": "Survey of poetry\u2019s work within social movements form the 1960s to today. Readings range from the Civil Rights, Third World, and Women\u2019s Liberation movements of the 1960s, \u201870s, and \u201880s to more recent writing from Black Lives Matter, Idle No More, and climate change activists. What radical thinking does poetry make possible within activist contexts? How can we recover and engage in poetry\u2019s life off of the page and within workshops, sit-ins, public readings, or artistic collaborations? How might a longer timeline of activist work enrich our understanding of politically-informed poetic composition today?\u00a0",
