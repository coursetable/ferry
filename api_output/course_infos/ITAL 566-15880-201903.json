    "description": "How do we take leave of the people, places, and work that we love? Our course objectives are to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in life and artistic expression, especially between 1300 and 1700; to probe the differences between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of life and one\u2019s lifework; and to contextualize our readings within more contemporary conversations by theologians and theorists about dying, grief, and letting go. We also examine rites of passage and departure, even as our main focus is figures such as Dante, Michelangelo, Montaigne, Shakespeare, and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, whose differing faiths during a period of religious crisis produced various kinds of finished\u2014and unfinished\u2014works. Meetings are in the Beinecke Library, where we regularly consult first editions and in some cases (Donne\u2019s letters and poems) autograph copies, as well as evaluate the material evidence for ways that manuscripts and books reveal how authors parted with their works (dedications, envois), and how readers comment on their own encounters with leave-takings.",
