    "description": "An investigation into the essay film, which has emerged as one of the most popular forms of documentary both in terms of production and critical analysis. What characterizes an essay film and what constitutes the genre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history? The course pursues these questions by placing weekly screenings in dialogue with key texts that engage these issues. Particular attention is given to a group of auteur filmmakers who are strongly associated with the form: Alain Resnais, Chris Marker, Agnes Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, and Harun Farocki. However, we also look beyond these familiar icons.\nPriority is given to undergraduates who have taken FILM 150.",
