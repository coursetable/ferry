    "description": "This seminar examines research on the psychology of judgment. We focus on identifying factors that influence various judgments and compare them to which factors individuals want and expect to drive their judgments. Topics of discussion include judgment heuristics and biases, confidence and calibration, issues of well-being including predictions and experiences, regret and counterfactuals. The goal is threefold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing research on individual judgment, to develop the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to existing knowledge. Students generally enroll from a variety of disciplines, including cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, finance, marketing, political science, medicine, and public health.",
