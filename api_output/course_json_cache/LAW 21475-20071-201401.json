    "description": "\u2020Advanced Written Advocacy (21475). 3 units. This seminar will (1) train students to advocate for their clients more effectively and (2) familiarize students with the life cycle of a civil lawsuit. To improve students\u2019 strategic writing, we will scrutinize excellent trial motions and appellate briefs to see how top practitioners tell their clients\u2019 stories, organize and build legal arguments, and advance their clients' strategic interests. We will also review numerous other types of litigation-related documents, including letters, memoranda, complaints, answers, scheduling orders, and document requests. The course will provide a fair amount of instruction about the stylistic side of \u201clegal writing,\u201d but it will focus on advocacy\u2019s more substantive facets. Students will prepare three short but challenging assignments as part of a team and either one or two other assignments on their own. To familiarize students with the arc of a civil suit, members of the class will prepare short presentations about a prominent lawsuit; over the course of the semester, these presentations will help students see how a case gets from filing to finality. Enrollment limited to sixteen. N. Messing. Note: Students may not drop the course after the second class session begins.",
