    "description": "Compliance: Legal Practicum (30220). 2 units. Lawyers increasingly are expected to guide organizations to identify, assess and comply with legal requirements and demonstrate risk management and governance. At the same time, legal mandates require organizations to protect whistleblowers, while enforcement guidelines induce organizations to self-report violations. In short, compliance constitutes an increasingly dynamic and challenging field for lawyers, one demanding the ability to understand the separate perspectives of regulators, business leaders, consumers, and employees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis course will explore the legal, ethical, and policy foundations of compliance: the effort to translate statutory mandates into compliant organizational and individual behavior. This course will seek to meet three objectives: (1) enable students to identify and proactively address potential compliance issues; (2) develop the practical problem-solving skills needed to respond to compliance failures; and (3) provide students with the theoretical and practical tools necessary to advocate on behalf of a company under investigation for a regulatory violation. Enrollment limited to twelve to sixteen. To achieve this objective, the course will employ both simulations and practical case studies, working directly with organizations in the non-profit/public service sectors; the course thus is particularly well-suited for students interested in those sectors, as well as start-up and in-house counsel careers. Permission of the instructor required. G. Garrity-Rokous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> There will be three dates where the class will meet until 4 p.m. to allow for three weeks when the class will not meet. Dates to be announced.<br/>\n<br/>",
