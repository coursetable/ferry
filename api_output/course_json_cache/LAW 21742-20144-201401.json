    "description": "Marriage and the State: Seminar (21742). 3 units. This seminar will consider the relationship between marriage and the state, past and present, with particular attention to the many ways that marriage serves as a source of public entitlements, benefits, and rights. We will explore marriage\u2019s regulatory role in several contexts, including social insurance (e.g., pensions and Social Security), need-based welfare, citizenship, and immigration. Readings and discussion will focus on how marriage has served as a state-building tool; how the use of marriage as a redistributive instrument has shaped the legal contours and social meanings of marriage; and how different individuals and groups excluded from marriage\u2019s many entitlements have contested that exclusion. In particular, we will consider how using marriage as a tool for distributing public rights and entitlements has given rise to contests over the meaning of equality \u2013 socio-economic equality, racial equality, gender equality, and, most recently, marriage equality. Readings will include statutes, cases, constitutional provisions, international conventions, primary historical sources, and secondary literature from the fields of law, history, political science, and sociology. We will focus primarily on the public- law dimensions of marriage in the United States, but readings will also include a healthy dose of international law and comparative sources. Students will be required to write a seminar paper, and, to that end, we will dedicate the last three sessions of the semester to student presentations of works-in-progress. Students who wish to use their seminar paper to fulfill the Substantial Paper requirement must request permission to do so by week 5 of the semester. Seminar papers may not be used to satisfy the Supervised Analytic Writing requirement. Paper required. Enrollment limited to ten. K.Collins.",
