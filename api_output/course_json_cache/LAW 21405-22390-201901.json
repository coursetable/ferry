    "description": "Withdrawal from Multilateral Treaty Agreements: Seminar (21405). 3 or 4 units. This course will ask: &quot;Could the President, by a single tweet, withdraw the United States from the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and the North American Treaty Organization?&quot; In 2019 two major treaty withdrawals will reach important watersheds. On March 29, 2019, the United Kingdom is scheduled to withdraw from the European Union under the withdrawal notice it gave under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. On November 4, 2019, the United States, under the administration of Donald Trump, is set to give notice that it will withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Accord one year later. These and other events worldwide\u2014e.g., the withdrawal of African states from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and North Korea\u2019s threatened withdrawal\u2014raise important questions about the comparative law and politics of withdrawal from multilateral treaty arrangements. Students will write papers regarding particular case studies. Students who write Supervised Analytic Writing papers may earn four units. Occasional guest speakers. Enrollment limited. Scheduled examination or Substantial paper required. H.H. Koh.<br/>\n<br/>",
