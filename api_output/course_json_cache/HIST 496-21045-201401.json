    "description": "<p>There will be a mandatory senior essay meeting on Monday, September 9, 2013, in 114 SSS at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Preparation of the required senior departmental essay under the supervision of a member of the faculty. Students expecting to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495a during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496b in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495b in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496a during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by December 2, 2013. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the undergraduate History administrator in 237 HGS no later than September 16, 2013 (for HIST 495a), or January 17, 2014 (for 495b). Blank statement forms are available in 237 HGS before the end of a student's junior year, and thereafter in the Senior Essay handbook. Students writing a senior essay must attend a <a href=\"http://www.library.yale.edu/instruction/hist\" target=\"_blank\">library workshop for historians</a>. Students enrolled in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a> submit to their advisers a prospectus of the essay and an annotated bibliography during the course of the term, and at least ten pages of the essay or a detailed outline of the entire project by December 2, <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%202013\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 2013\"  class=\"notoffered\">2013</a> (495a), or May 5, <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%202014\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 2014\"  class=\"notoffered\">2014</a> (495b). Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student's being asked to withdraw from <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a>.</p>\n<p>Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20211\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 211\" >211</a> HGS no later than 5 p.m. on April 7, 2014, in the spring term, or no later than 5 p.m. on December 2, 2013, in the fall term. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.</p>\n<p>The essays should take the form of substantial articles, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty double-spaced typewritten pages), with the total word count given at the end of the essay. This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Essays generally run between 10,000 and 12,<a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20500\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 500\"  class=\"notoffered\">500</a> words. The limitation on length is regarded as important because precision, clarity, and conciseness are essential to good historical writing. A brief evaluation of major sources is required. Consult the director of the senior essay course for details.</p>",
