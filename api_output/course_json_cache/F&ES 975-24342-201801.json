    "description": "1 to 4 credits. Students have the opportunity to continue the development of Yale Law School\u2019s new environmental justice clinic and to develop a docket to improve environmental quality and public health in communities of color and low-income communities. In the wake of a national conversation about the water crisis in Flint and lead poisoning across the country, students will continue to be in on the ground floor as the clinic represents clients challenging inequality in the distribution of health hazards as well as procedural inequities they face as they seek to assert their own vision for the future of their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. The clinic\u2019s work includes cases and advocacy projects to enforce civil rights in the environmental context and to address issues of environmental injustice in particular communities. Students must complete and document hours of clinical work per week commensurate with their credit hours. They are also expected to participate in weekly one-half-hour team meetings. Previous participation in the environmental justice clinic is a prerequisite for Advanced Fieldwork. Only F&amp;ES students who receive 3 credits or more for this advanced clinic can count it as a capstone course.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Permission of the instructor required. Open only to students who completed the spring clinic. In addition to listing this clinic among experiential course selections, previous EJ Clinic students should submit a short statement expressing continued interest in the clinic to marianne.engelman-lado@yale.edu by June 22 at 4:30 p.m.</p>",
