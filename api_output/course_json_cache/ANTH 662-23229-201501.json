    "description": "This interdisciplinary seminar, designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in Anthropology and Global Health, explores anthropological ethnographies on many of the serious health problems facing populations in resource-poor societies around the globe. The course focuses on three major issues: (1) poverty, structural violence, and health as a human right; (2) struggles with infectious disease; and (3) the health of women and children (and men, too). Many major issues of global health concern are addressed, including the health-demoting effects of poverty, racism, patriarchy, and inhumane conditions of life and labor in many countries; men's and women's sexuality in the era of HIV/AIDS; the politics of epidemic disease control and other disasters, and the role of communities, nation-states, and international organizations in responding to such crises; issues of coercion in population control and the quest for reproductive rights; and how child health is ultimately dependent on the health and well-being of mothers. The underlying purpose of the course is to develop students' awareness of the political, socioeconomic, ecological, and cultural complexity of most health problems in so-called developing nations and the consequent need for anthropological sensitivity, contextualization, and activist involvement in the field of global health. The course is also designed to expose students to salient health issues in many parts of the world, from the United States to China. However, the primary focus is on global health issues facing sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: some background in medical anthropology, global health studies, or other relevant fields.</p>",
