    "description": "*\u2020Transnational Development Clinic (20577). 3 units, credit/fail, with a graded option. Students in the Transnational Development Clinic work on a range of litigation and non-litigation projects designed to explore the sites for productive intervention of U.S.-based lawyers in development work. With a focus on global poverty, students in the Clinic will identify models of what could be termed &quot;development lawyering.&quot; The Clinic takes a critical perspective on development, interrogating its troubled histories, ideologies, and institutions, and considering shifts in development theory and practice away from an exclusive focus on economic growth and toward equitable distribution of growth, accountable and effective institutions, and capacities-based approaches and understandings. Rather than work with traditional international development institutions, such as the World Bank or U.N. bodies, the Clinic partners with community-based clients, membership-based organizations, and non-governmental organizations and provides them with legal advice, counseling, and representation in order to promote models of inclusive development. With these collaborative partners, the Clinic uses a range of domestic and international mechanisms to either affirmatively promote inclusive development projects or to mount resistance to traditional, institutional approaches to development. The projects are transnational in that they involve mechanisms, strategies, and partnerships both situated in the U.S. and spanning national boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent projects focus on (1) land reform, foreign direct investment and the transition to democracy in Burma/Myanmar; and (2) demands for UN accountability for its role in causing a massive cholera outbreak in Haiti. Past projects have focused on intersections of development and labor, trade, environment, and intellectual property, including: use of International Finance Institution (IFI) accountability mechanisms (e.g., the World Bank Inspection Panel, the International Finance Corporation Ombudsperson and Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman) on behalf of communities adversely affected by environmental consequences of IFI-funded projects; representation of workers and unions with workers' rights claims in proceedings under labor provisions of multilateral free trade agreements (e.g., North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (the NAFTA labor side agreement), CAFTA labor chapter complaint mechanism)); and support of patent litigation in developing countries with pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, designed to increase access to affordable medications for poor people. Projects may involve international travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nA seminar accompanying the fieldwork provides readings and structured discussion to explore the relationships among law, development and advocacy. In addition, the seminar examines practice-based advocacy skills, including brief writing, oral advocacy, and policy advocacy, and considers professional responsibility as applied to transnational development practice. Limited enrollment. Permission of instructor required. M.I. Ahmad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork-only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance; Prosecution Externship; SFALP (New Haven Corp Counsel section only).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Selection:</i> In addition to listing this course among experiential permission selections, students should also submit a statement of interest and a CV by June 26 at 4:30 p.m. Listing this course among experiential permission selections constitutes authorization for the Registrar's Office to release a copy of the student's YLS transcript to the instructor.<br/>\n<br/>",
