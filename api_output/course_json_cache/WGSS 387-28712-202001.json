    "description": "<p>The use of critical texts that span a wide range of disciplines to examine gender and sexuality in the context of predominantly Muslim countries and cultures, as well as the larger transnational discourses that shape the ways in which Islam is imagined in relationship to gender and sexuality. By putting gender and sexuality at the center of our analysis, we are able to tease out the complex relationships between religion, culture, nation-sates, and racialization, and think about how particular constructions of gender and sexuality have been central to the production and reproduction of each of these social structures. A critical knowledge of Orientalism, colonialism, and global inequalities is crucial for a careful and nuanced understanding of the different roles gender and sexuality have played, and continue to play in representations of Islam, and Muslims. This also underlines the current place of Islam not only as a world religion, or a set of beliefs and practices, but also as a &quot;signifer.&quot; Students develop a historical understanding of many contemporary discussions around Islam and what gets referred to as &quot;Muslim cultures&quot; and should be able to\u00a0critically engage with and complicate\u00a0the terms and issues such as &quot;cultural difference,&quot; &quot;women's and LGBT rights,&quot; and &quot;modernity/civilization&quot; that are widely and easily deployed in current political and moral discourses around the Middle East and Islam.</p>",
