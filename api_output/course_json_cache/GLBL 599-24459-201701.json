    "description": "Hope Village is a settlement housing close to 4000 people between the ages of 20 and 60 outside Mogadishu, Somalia. The settlement has brokered a peace with warring factions and provides basic needs for its inhabitants. Virtually all of the people residing there are unemployed. This class will investigate the challenges involved with creating employment in an extreme environment. This is not a strictly theoretical study. The goal of the seminar is to create a viable business plan and, ideally, secure the first purchase order for a product produced by the settlement. This is not a traditional seminar, but rather is a group project. Working as a team, we will undertake market research, learn about fair trade markets, engage in a costing and pricing study, research quality control, and explore the challenges involved in exporting from Somalia. While travel to Somalia is not feasible, we will be working with a former World Fellow who lives and works in the settlement. We will also be assisted by the former CEO of a large multinational firm. Together, our goal will be to actually create jobs. While success is certainly not guaranteed, the journey should be an interesting one.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">The course will be limited to 10 students. This graduate course is open to students from Yale Jackson, Yale Law School, FES, and Yale SOM as well as Yale College. Interested students must attend the first class meeting on January 17. If the course is oversubscribed, interested students will be asked to submit an application to the Jackson Institute program registrar by January 20.</p>",
