The statement, which should include the essay title and a brief description of the subject to be treated, must be signed by the student's adviser and submitted\u00a0to the DUS. All subsequent deadlines are also strict, including for the project outline and bibliography, complete essay draft, and the final essay itself.\u00a0Failure to comply with any deadline will be penalized by a lower final grade, and no late essay will be considered for a prize in the department.\u00a0Senior essay workshops that will meet periodically throughout the term are also mandatory. Permission may be given to write a two-term essay after consultation with the student's adviser and the DUS. Only those who have begun to do advanced work in a given area and whose project is considered to be of exceptional promise are eligible. The requirements for the one-term senior essay apply to the two-term essay, except that the essay should be\u00a050-75 pages in length.</p>",
