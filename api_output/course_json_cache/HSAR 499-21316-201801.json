    "description": "<p>Preparation of a research paper about thirty pages long under the direction of a qualified instructor. The essay is written in either the fall or the spring term of the senior year, though preferably in the fall term. Students write on subjects of their own choice. During the term before the essay is written, students plan the project in consultation with a qualified instructor or with the director of undergraduate studies. No student is permitted to enroll in HSAR 499 without submitting a project statement, with the formal title of the essay and a brief description of the subject to be treated. The statement must be signed by the student's adviser and presented to the director of undergraduate studies before the student's schedule can be approved.</p>\n<p>The student must submit a suitable project outline and bibliography to the adviser and the director of undergraduate studies early in the term. The outline should indicate the focus and scope of the essay topic, as well as the proposed research methodology; the bibliography should be annotated. Students must also complete a library research colloquium for the senior essay. For essays submitted in the fall term, the deadline for the outline is Friday, September 15 2017; for those in the spring term, Friday, January 26 2018. Senior essays written in the fall term are due on Friday, December 8, 2017; those in the spring term on Friday, April 27, 2018. Two copies must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies. Failure to comply with any deadline will be penalized by a lower final grade. No late essay will be considered for a prize in the department.</p>\n<p>Permission may be given to write a two-term essay after consultation with an adviser and the director of undergraduate studies. Only those who have begun to do advanced work in a given area and whose project is considered to be of exceptional promise are eligible. The requirements for the one-term senior essay apply to the two-term essay, except that the essay should be from fifty to sixty pages in length.</p>",
