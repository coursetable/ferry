    "description": "Juvenile Justice Clinic: Fieldwork (30134). 2 units, credit/fail, with a graded option. Must be taken simultaneously with the seminar portion. Open only to JD students. Enrollment limited. Permission of the instructor required. T.R. Birckhead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Bidding:</i> Students who bid on and are accepted in the seminar portion of the clinic will be automatically enrolled in the fieldwork section. Students do not need to bid on the fieldwork section.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> New students who are accepted into this clinic must attend a one-day intensive session to prepare for their first client meetings and court appearances. For the Spring 2017 clinic, this all-day session will be held on Friday, January 13 from 9:30 a.m. until 5 p.m. Attendance is required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Because of the frequency of court appearances, students must keep two mornings a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, 9 a.m. - 1 p.m., and 2 - 4 p.m.) free from other obligations. Due to immediate commitments to our clients, Professor Birckhead will finalize the roster by email before the first class, after which the clinic cannot be dropped. Because classes prepare students for client work, attendance at all classes is mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance; Prosecution Externship.<br/>\n<br/>",
