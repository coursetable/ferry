    "description": "This course is a study of methods of communication that will equip students to engage with the public to share findings and insights, influence policy, identify problems, and maximize the effectiveness of their work. While the challenges in health policy demand ever more complex academic study, some 100 million Americans do not know, for example, that the Affordable Care Act is the same thing as Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmuch less what the law includes and means. The gap between those driving the conversation and those alienated and excluded from it is growing daily. This severely limits systemic improvements, and even rational discussion of improvement. Traditionally, public health experts have had a limited array of tools at their disposal to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to inform, hear from, react to, and influence the lives of many. This course is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and affect the world, only exacerbating distrust, division, and claims of elitism. Public health can only exist as an active process of communication between practitioners, researchers, and the public. Trust is built when science happens as a shared endeavor.",
