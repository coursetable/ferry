    "description": "This interdisciplinary seminar brings together students with different skills and experiences to work on a project already underway, called MANY. MANY is an online platform that facilitates migration through an exchange of needs. The project was initiated at Yale in 2017, and a small cohort of faculty and students exhibited a beta version of the platform at the US Pavilion of the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale. See: <a href=\"http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org/participants/keller-easterling-with-many\" target=\"_blank\">http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org/participants/keller-easterling-with-many</a>. MANY allows cities to match their needs with the needs of mobile people to generate mutual benefits. Using secure group-to-group connections and existing short-term project-based visas, cities can bargain with their underexploited spaces to attract a changing influx of talent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtalent that offers time and training in exchange for global credentials. MANY speaks for those who want to resettle as well as for those who never wanted the citizenship that the nation withholds or reluctantly bestows. The seminar offers lectures and readings by thinkers, authors, strategists, developers, film makers, policy-makers, activists and urbanists from Yale faculty and outside guests together with workshops and one final presentation/symposium. Teams of students develop the project, exploring such things as Digital Architecture and Financing, Laws/Standards/Visas, Architecture/Urbanism/Landscape, Political/Economic/Environmental Migration, and Cultural Narratives of migration. Students have opportunity to work on: coding the application; visa research; researching spatial variables for exchange; and/or the political, economic, or environmental underpinnings of the project.",
