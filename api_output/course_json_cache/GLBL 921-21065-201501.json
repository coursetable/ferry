    "description": "Researchers find themselves increasingly working alongside humanitarian workers in states of emergency, armed conflict, food crises, and natural disasters. The goal of this seminar course is to discuss state-of-the-art analyses of humanitarian interventions in order to develop comparative analysis and insight. We debate issues of theoretical, empirical, and policy relevance through a grounding in current literature. Readings include narratives from the field and well-articulated critiques or commentaries. This course is of interest to students interested in anthropology, international development, global health, development, and human security interventions. Topics include the form and content of humanitarian aid; how humanitarian actors bring notions of culture, dignity, and justice into quotidian practice; how personal relations structure the dynamics and shape of humanitarian action; how humanitarians negotiate the many critical conflicts in humanitarian practice; the relationship between military and humanitarian interventions, and between short-term aid and long-term development; and issues related to policy, legal protection, health care, morality, and governance in relation to the moral imperative to save lives in conditions of extreme adversity.",
