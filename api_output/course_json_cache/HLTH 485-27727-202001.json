    "description": "<p>This class provides Yale College seniors (with priority given to Global Health Studies\u00a0 Scholars) the opportunity to comprehensively interrogate critical topics at the intersection of global health, policy, and justice with a focus on advocacy as a tool, and health equity as a goal. Through a weekly seminar (with readings, case studies, guest lectures, and seminar-style discussion), students develop the knowledge and tools to engage critically and constructively with the ideas and practices constituting advocacy, movement-building, and policy-making in global health, and work to develop a capstone project in which they explore and/or present various forms of policy development, strategic advocacy, and/or claims-making in global health.Course readings and approaches draw from human rights, public health, historical, anthropological, and other critical frames in order to introduce students to the multiple lenses through which questions of global health justice can be addressed. This course is designed to encompass diverse disciplinary perspectives and approaches: final products can be theoretically focused or analytic papers, strategic development/arguments for policy development and/or assessment of historical or archival research.\u00a0This course is a requirement for all Global Health Studies Scholars who are graduating seniors and who did not complete <a href=\"/search/?p=HLTH%20490\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HLTH 490\"  class=\"notoffered\">HLTH 490</a> in Fall <a href=\"/search/?p=HLTH%202018\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HLTH 2018\"  class=\"notoffered\">2018</a>. Yale College seniors who are not Global Health Studies Scholars but who have significant interest and prior coursework in global health, as well as ideas for a final project, can write to the instructors sharing their relevant background and requesting permission to enroll. Cap of 15 students</p>",
