    "description": "1, 2, or 3 credits. Soils are important to food security, providing food, fiber, and shelter for humans and terrestrial wildlife. Soils are also important sinks of atmospheric carbon, more so than the aboveground terrestrial vegetation for many types of ecosystems. Worldwide, soils are constantly impacted by unsustainable management practices in agriculture, forestry, and other human activities, as well as by climate change. However, sustainable techniques geared to increasing soil conservation can mitigate or reverse detrimental effects on soils. This is an advanced course in soil science, and enrolling students are expected to have sufficient background such as graduate or undergraduate courses in soil science. The course offers one or two introductory lectures to refresh and update key concepts as needed: soil formation, classification, soil physical factors; organic matter and nutrients. The rest of the seminar is devoted to lectures and discussion sessions on more advanced topics, including rehabilitation of degraded soils through reforestation; soil sustainability in natural forest management and plantation forestry; soils as a sink for atmospheric carbon; carbon sequestration in pastures and forests; soil changes in shifting agriculture; soil changes during forest succession; soil productivity in agroforestry; soil erosion control; organic farming; mycorrhizae and organic biostimulants; wetland soils; urban soils; soil contaminants and bioremediation. Guest speakers include soil scientists from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) among others. We meet once a week for three hours. At each meeting, lectures are followed by discussion of relevant articles provided by the instructor or students. This class may be taken for one, two, or three credits. One-credit students attend all classes and seminars, and are expected to lead one discussion section. Two-credit students are expected to participate in lectures and discussions, lead a discussion session, and give an oral seminar on a relevant topic of interest. Three-credit students have similar requirements as two-credit students, and they write a term paper on a relevant subject of their choice. Field trips: wetlands (marshes) in Branford/Guilford, cattle farm, organic farm, among others.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: undergraduate- or graduate-level soils courses.</p>",
