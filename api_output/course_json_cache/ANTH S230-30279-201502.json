    "description": "Offered in Singapore. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week thematically based exploration of Southeast Asia's geographical and cultural diversity, which takes advantage of Singapore's position and character as a microcosm of this diversity. Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, SE2222: Southeast Asia in Context provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological, and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural, and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy context-based learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited. For further information please visit the Yale Summer Session Study Abroad website. 1 Yale Credit and 1 NUS Credit. Tuition: TBA. Course dates: June 21 - July 25.",
