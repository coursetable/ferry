    "description": "2.5 credit hours. The goal of this first-year, one-term practicum is to provide the student with an opportunity to develop clinical skills with older adult clients and their families. While in psychiatric clinical settings, students apply skills including holistic physical and mental health assessment, formulate differential diagnosis, plan and implement developmentally appropriate psychiatric nursing interventions, and evaluate interventions and outcomes. Emphasis is placed on application of a variety of population-specific assessment skills and use of differential diagnosis, and a beginning utilization of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment methods with individuals, groups, and families. Clinical experiences require the student to synthesize knowledge from courses, supplemental readings, clinical seminars, and practice experiences. Students are assigned to psychiatric clinical placements on the basis of development of competencies, previous clinical experience, and interests. Required of psychiatric\u2013mental health nurse practitioner students in the first year of specialization. This course may be taken concurrently with didactic first- or second-year PMH specialty course work. Supervision seminar meets one and one-half hours per week.",
