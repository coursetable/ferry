    "description": "Art and International Human Rights: Theory and Practice (20581). 3 units graded, with a credit/fail option. This seminar will examine the dynamic connections between art and artistic practices and international human rights. Through readings, guest speakers, and workshops with artists, the seminar will consider the possibilities of art as an agent of social change; the relationships between aesthetics, politics, and ethics, with special attention to representations of suffering and atrocity; case studies of collaboration among artists, lawyers, and advocates; and issues of truth and objectivity in documentary. Students will also participate in collaborative projects with commissioned artists (for example, visual artists, playwrights, or choreographers), working closely with them in the design, research, and realization of new works. Student work on these projects will take the form of an \u201cartistic research clinic.\u201d Guest speakers will include scholars, artists, curators, and human rights practitioners from across the world. Graduate students from diverse disciplines are encouraged to enroll. Paper requirement. Enrollment limited to fifteen. Permission of the instructor required. J.J.
