    "description": "This course examines economic strategies for nonprofit and for-profit organizations and firms operating in the developing world. The first half of the course focuses on conducting business in environments with weak or deficient institutions, including corruption, political instability, lack of contract enforceability, and poor investor protection. The course primarily uses quantitative economic and game theoretic analysis to examine these issues, and we draw heavily on microeconomic analysis taught in the first year (or in undergraduate intermediate-level economics courses). The second half explores the role of nonprofits, NGOs, and multilateral institutions in the process of development. We study credit market failures and the gap filled by micro-credit institutions. We learn some strategies to evaluate the desirability and success of development projects in social marketing, poverty reduction, and microfinance. We use the tools of economics to analyze contentious international policy issues such as natural resource exploitation, the free trade of goods including environmental goods (e.g., waste and pollution), intellectual property protection, and labor rights.",
