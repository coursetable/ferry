    "description": "<p>While the notion of identity always has been part of the human experience, only in modern times has it been acknowledged as a crucial component of human development and well-being, and thus subject to normative reasoning. Through identity, we conceptualize who and what we are and establish mental representations of ourselves in contrast to others. Through identity, we map our social reality, classify and orient our interactions, and delineate a coherency between our innateness, self-manifestations, and social recognitions. By the same token, religious identity is not an objective existence that arises from essential and distinct religious traits. It is the product of constructed boundaries and human decisions to be identified with certain groups or traditions and to be differentiated from others. The main inquiries leading discussions in this course are: What interest or duty does the state have to protect, respect, preserve, or maintain individuals\u2019 religious identities? What role should the law play with regard to religious identity? In premodern times, interactions of law and religious identity were governed by power relations and decided according to the reigning theological perspective. In modern liberal contexts, however, the law\u2019s encounter with religious identity exposes tensions within legal principles and expectations. The law\u2019s concern with religious identity is consistent with the values of autonomy, free choice, and self-determination. Yet it is less in harmony with the commitment of the law to equality, impartiality, neutrality, and blindness to the particularity of a given person. Jurisprudentially, the notion of religious identity challenges the traditional division between private and public and revises the dichotomy between forum internum and forum externum\u2014distinctions on which much of public moral reasoning and constitutional logic are based. The course includes conceptual, historical, and comparative legal analyses. First, we discuss conceptual aspects of religious identity. Next, we develop a historical perspective on the various settings where religious identity played a role in legal contexts. Against the background of these surveys, we address contemporary cases where religious identity was adjudicated or discussed as a matter of policy. Special attention is given to a comparison of Israeli cases to other Western settings. This comparative choice stems from the observation that while in the Israeli context, religious identity is understood as a firmly defined ethnic or national characteristic, it is perceived in Europe and the United States as more fluid and a personal choice.</p>",
