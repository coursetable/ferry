    "description": "Must be taken in New Haven. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Must be taken pass/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based, and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28 / Session B: July 1 - August 2",
