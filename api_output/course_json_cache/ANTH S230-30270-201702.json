    "description": "Offered in Singapore. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week exploration of Southeast Asia\u2019s geographical, historical and cultural diversity. This course takes advantage of Singapore\u2019s strategic position in offering a unique blend of classroom instruction at the NUS campus with hands-on fieldwork in other SE Asian countries. The lecturers are experienced teachers and researchers of Southeast Asia, who will explore themes such as Southeast Asian religion, archaeology, rural development, politics and regional integration. The field trip includes visits to magnificent ancient temples, rural agricultural communities, war memorials and a fair sampling of local village life that is well off the usual tourist track. Participants study two modules (choose 2 out of 3 elective modules) on Southeast Asian Studies with an anthropological and historical concentration. The first elective module, &quot;SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context&quot; provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia. The other two elective modules, \u201cSE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic&quot; and \u201cSE3214: Marketing Southeast Asia\u2019s Heritage\u201d, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture. SE2880A features a 7 to 9-day field trip to various religious and cultural sites in Indonesia while SE3214 will bring students to various field trips in Singapore. All three modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.
