    "description": "This course will offer an introduction to international law. Students will learn the basic minimum that every lawyer should know about the international dimensions of law in the modern world. The course is also meant to serve as a gateway to the rest of the international law curriculum: It will offer a foundation on which students who are interested in further study of the particular topics covered in the class can later build. The course will cover both the public and private dimensions of international law, offering an introduction to varied topics including international trade, international tax, international business transactions, environmental law, criminal law, human rights law, and the law of armed conflict. The course will also offer an introduction to domestic law topics that intersect with international law, including foreign relations and national security law. As each new topic is introduced, the class will not only examine that new topic in detail, but will also explore how it relates to what the class has already discussed. By considering together topics usually taught separately, students will begin to see how different subjects under the broad umbrella of international law are interconnected. And by learning about a variety of issue areas and making direct comparisons across them, students will gain an understanding of each topic that can be had only by viewing it in a comparative perspective.",
