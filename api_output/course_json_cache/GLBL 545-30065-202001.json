    "description": "<p>Emotions are integral to our understanding of human behavior and the world around us, yet they are often given insufficient attention within the study of international relations. This course makes them the focus of study. Challenging the dichotomy of reason and emotion, it examines how emotions play a critical role in foreign policy alongside power, security, politics, and interests. The first part of the course sets out the conceptual and methodological foundations. Students analyze different approaches, consider how they are expressed and communicated, and look at the dynamics of individual and collective emotions. The second part of the course focuses on the meaning of concepts such as trust, empathy, shame, and honor and applies them to historical and contemporary case studies. The course is interdisciplinary, drawing on research in international relations theory, politics, history, political psychology, and philosophy. It uses a variety of methodologies with an emphasis on qualitative and interpretative methods including discourse and semiotic analysis, and students are encouraged to use archival materials to find and demonstrate evidence of emotions in prominent cases.</p>",
