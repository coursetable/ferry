    "description": "<p>How did the United States progress from \u201cwinning\u201d the Cold War, through the \u201cunipolar moment\u201d of the 1990s and bloody conflicts of the post-9/11 landscape, to where it stands today: facing near-peer regional competitors in Asia and Europe, and faltering public faith in the \u201cLiberal World Order\u201d America helped create? To what degree was this trajectory inevitable, as new economic and geopolitical forces emerged after the Cold War? To what degree was it determined by choices made by the six most recent presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump? This seminar examines presidential decision-making over three decades, as these presidents and their advisers struggled to devise a new American \u201cgrand strategy\u201d without the foil of a rival superpower. It explores how they defined U.S. national interests; what threats they identified pre- and post-9/11; and what diplomatic, military, and economic instruments of U.S. power they chose to meet those challenges. The primary objective is for students, especially aspiring policy makers, to develop an understanding of how complicated foreign policy making is in the heat of crisis, under competing strategic, political, and human pressures, and the president\u2019s own instincts. Weekly readings include book excerpts, analytical articles, original sources, memoirs, and an occasional film or novel of the era. Classes are built around brief opening lectures; student discussions of framing questions from the instructor; the instructor\u2019s insights from covering U.S. foreign policy making in Washington and conflict zones overseas; and occasional guest speakers directly involved in internal policy debates at the time.</p>",
