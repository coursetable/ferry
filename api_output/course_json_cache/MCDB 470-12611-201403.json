    "description": "<p>Individual or small-group study for qualified students who wish to investigate a broad area of experimental biology not presently covered by regular courses. A student must be sponsored by a Yale faculty member, who sets the requirements. The course must include one or more written examinations and/or a term paper. Intended to be a supplementary course and, therefore, to have weekly or biweekly discussion meetings between the student and the sponsoring faculty member. To register, the student must prepare a form, which is available at\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://mcdb.yale.edu/forms\" target=\"_blank\">http://mcdb.yale.edu/forms</a> as well as on the course site on Classes*v2, and a written plan of study with bibliography, approved by the faculty research adviser. The form and proposal must be uploaded to Classes*v2 by the end of the second week of classes. The final paper is due in the hands of the sponsoring faculty member, with a copy to the course instructor, by the last day of classes. In special cases, with approval of the director of undergraduate studies, this course may be elected for more than one term, but only one term may count as an elective toward the major.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Fulfills the senior requirement for the B.A. degree if taken in the senior year.</p>",
