    "description": "3 credits. This seminar assesses the proliferation of policy innovations aimed at promoting and encouraging \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d (CSR). We define CSR broadly to include the diverse range of self- and civil regulation, voluntary instruments, private authority, and nonstate market-driven (NSMD) initiatives that have emerged in the past fifteen years to engage firms directly, rather than working through traditional governmental process. Examples include firm-level initiatives, industry codes, product codes, third-party certification, ethical brands and labels, and \u201cclean\u201d investment funds. The course reviews the growing literature on these phenomena that now exists within political science, management, economics, sociology, environmental studies, and law. Our aim is to reflect on the broad array of scholarship on emergence and institutionalization of CSR innovations questions. While the class is interested in assessing the strategic advantage that CSR might bring firms, our emphasis is on whether, and how, CSR initiatives might address enduring policy problems where traditional governmental approaches have been ineffective. The course is organized into four components. First, we review and assess the different types of CSR or \u201cprivate\u201d policy instruments vying for firm-level support and distinguish them from traditional governmental mechanisms. Second, we discuss what is meant by \u201ceffectiveness\u201d and the different ways of measuring success. Third, we assess the assumptions behind different theoretical frameworks about what types of CSR innovations firms are more likely to support, if any, and why. Fourth, we turn to empirical evidence to assess existing theories of support, and what this means for understanding support and effectiveness of CSR. This section draws on a variety of empirical methods including guest speakers from the world of CSR, analysis of large-N analyses on support, as well as detailed historical and comparative case studies.",
