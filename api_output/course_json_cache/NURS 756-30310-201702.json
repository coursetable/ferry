    "description": "6 credit hours. This clinical course builds upon the experiences gained in 556b and provides students further opportunity to develop advanced nursing skills, clinical judgment, and evidence-based patient management strategies necessary to manage common acute and chronic health care conditions. Students participate in designated weekly primary care clinical experiences arranged by faculty. In addition, students meet weekly for a one-and-one-half-hour clinical conference that is held concurrently with clinical practice. Clinical seminar discussions for family nurse practitioner students focus on family-centered care and providing care for patients across the life span. Clinical seminar discussions for all other students focus on providing patient-centered care for patients from adolescence to senescence. Clinical conference serves as a forum for students to present and discuss cases and explore issues encountered in clinical practice. Required of adult/gerontology primary care and family nurse practitioner students in the final year. Taken concurrently with 757a/b and, for family nurse practitioners, with 833a/b. Eight to sixteen hours of clinical practice per week (fifteen weeks), and one and one-half hours of clinical conference per week (each term).\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite (or concurrent with): 556b.</p>",
