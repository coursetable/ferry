    "description": "<p>This course examines some recent developments in gender and sexuality studies that are important for thinking about the methods, sources, and topics of work in religion, gender, and sexuality. Theologies of gender and sexuality have often reflected the (claimed) experiences of women and queer people in relatively uncritical ways. This course seeks rather to raise questions about how religiously engaged projects sensitive to issues of gender and sexuality should be done from a variety of unusual perspectives, pushing beyond the usual questions about revising orthodox Christian doctrine or including the perspectives of more groups into theology. Instead, the course examines specific histories and geographies of bodies, as well as debates around how bodies are written. It asks questions about the nature of representation, and the textual and visual mediation of social relationships. It examines the temporalities of feminist and queer affect in order to draw attention to the field-determining effects of the \u201cpolitical subjectivity\u201d (Robyn Wiegman) required in gender and sexuality studies. Students develop their own research projects in conversation with one of the sets of readings engaged in the course. The course is research- and reading-intensive, and allows students to complete significant research projects that may provide foundations for doctoral applications, future publications, or the like. Close engagement and mentoring take place throughout the term as students read into new fields of study and develop their own constructive projects. Area II and Area V.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites: at least one graduate-level seminar in theology, ethics, or philosophy; at least one graduate-level seminar in gender or sexuality studies; and permission of the instructor.</p>",
