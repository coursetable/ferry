    "description": "<p>This course is designed to introduce immunobiology Ph.D. students to translational research and medicine. Each weekly seminar focuses on a specific disease with a conspicuous immunological component. In-class periods consist of very interactive, didactic sections covering disease phenotype, underlying immunobiology and pathology, and mechanisms of treatment approaches, including limitations. Discussions are led by principal investigators who focus on human translational immunology and by clinician-scientists who see patients in associated clinics. Examples of topics include: T and B cell contributions to the underlying pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and other autoimmune diseases; immune responses to acute brain injury; inherited immune disorders; paradigms governing how antitumor immune responses are promoted or suppressed; and current approaches in immunotherapy-based clinical trials. Assignments challenge students to think creatively about solutions to problems that obstruct the progress toward understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. A term assignment, in the form of a research proposal, focuses on independent study of a translational immunobiology problem of each student\u2019s choosing. Students are provided with elective opportunities for experiential learning through clinic visits with course faculty instructors. The combination of medical knowledge and interaction with translational\u00a0 and clinician-scientists provides a new perspective to immunobiology Ph.D. students that broadens their basic science training. The exposure to the practice of medicine enables them (and other graduate students) to work more confidently at the interface of research and medicine and facilitate collaborations with clinical investigators.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: <a href=\"/search/?p=IBIO%20531\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:IBIO 531\" >IBIO 531</a> or a similar course that provides a solid foundation in fundamental immunology; may be waived for highly motivated students.</p>",
