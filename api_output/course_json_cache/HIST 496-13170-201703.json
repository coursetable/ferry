    "description": "<p>All senior History majors should attend the mandatory senior essay meeting in early September at a time and location to be announced in the online Senior Essay Handbook.</p>\n<p>The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser. As a significant work of primary-source research, it serves as the capstone project of the History major. Students writing the one-term senior essay enroll in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20497\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 497\" >HIST 497</a> (see description), not <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a> and 496. The two-term essay takes the form of a substantial article, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty to fifty double-spaced typewritten pages). This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a> during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a> in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a> submit to the administrator in <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20237\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 237\"  class=\"notoffered\">237</a> HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being asked to withdraw from <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20495\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 495\" >HIST 495</a>. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%20211\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 211\"  class=\"notoffered\">211</a> HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.</p>",
