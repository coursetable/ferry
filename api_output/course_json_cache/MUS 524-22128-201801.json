    "description": "4 credits. NP. Group B. A detailed investigation of Franz Schubert\u2019s small-scale vocal music, the collections in which it was published, and the contexts in which it was first performed. The course charts a path through Schubert\u2019s prolific and influential career as a composer of songs and song cycles, focusing on his relationships to previous traditions of song composition, his responses to the music of his contemporaries (including Beethoven), and the radical formal, harmonic, and temporal innovations characteristic of his own works. Parallel concerns include the performance practices that Schubert expected and the relevance of his biography to his music. The goal is a flexible and nuanced approach to the technical and interpretive problems posed by music and text in a wide variety of repertoire. Songs are chosen in part according to students\u2019 interests and current performance projects. Course requirements include weekly listening and short readings (primarily of song texts in English translation), three brief response papers (1\u20134 pages), occasional oral presentations, and a final examination on topics chosen by the student.",
