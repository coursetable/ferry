    "description": "Perhaps the most inventive writer, philosopher, and art critic of the French Enlightenment, Denis Diderot wrote at the conjunction of several eighteenth-century media and disciplines, in particular art; craft and technology; literature; philosophy; and science. It is in that light that this interdisciplinary seminar considers his work, not only in its own right, but also in relation to that of other figures of his time, including artists such as Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard; writers and playwrights such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau; and the philosopher Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, with whom he codirected the great Enlightenment masterwork, the <i>Encyclop\u00e9die,</i> along with the illustrator Louis-Jacques Goussier, who undertook most of the illustrations. A central focus is the relations between the project of the twenty-eight-volume <i>Encyclop\u00e9die,</i> carried out between 1751 and 1772, with its 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations, and that of the <i>Salons</i> written and privately published as letters to the Baron Grimm in <i>La Correspondance litt\u00e9raire, philosophique et critique</i> between 1759 and 1771, and 1775 and 1781. We stress the visual, art historical, and art critical significance of Diderot's thought; and we also consider his novels, letters, and dialogues; his essays on theater; and his philosophical writings on empirical science. Many of these texts are translated into English, but as much as possible we try to read them together in the original French.",
