    "description": "<p>How does a play move from concept to page to production? What are the steps involved along the way? What are the techniques within each phase that playwrights, directors, and actors utilize towards developing a play? This course seeks to show potential theater studies majors the practical aspects of new play development beyond the role of actor. Students are introduced to voices and stories that have recently emerged, treating the script more as a fluid blueprint rather than an unchangeable text. Students will analyze and compare various versions of a playscripts through reading, staging and discussion. Each student will explore texts through the eyes of directors, playwrights, actors, designers and dramaturgs - and will at times adopt those roles within exercises. The course will highlight the last fifteen years in American theater which has seen an unprecedented explosion of new plays, playwrights and new play development incubators. Works by playwrights Will Eno, Annie Baker, Danai Gurira, Sarah Ruhl, Branden Jennings-Jacobs and Sam Hunter will be investigated, analyzed, and explored. Enrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.</p>",
