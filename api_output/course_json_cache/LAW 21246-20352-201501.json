    "description": "\u2020Technology Law and Policy Clinic (21246) and Fieldwork (21427). 2 units for each part, credit/fail or graded at student option (4 units total). Students must be enrolled in both sections. With technological advances driving greater social, economic, and political change\u2014from access to information, health care, and entertainment to impacts on the environment, education, and commerce to facilitating greater surveillance by law enforcement agencies\u2014issues related to privacy, consumer rights, free speech, and intellectual property are becoming increasingly critical and complex.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic is a semester-long course that focuses on the representation of individuals, nonprofits, and consumer groups who are engaged with these questions from a public interest point-of-view. It involves a mixture of fieldwork and seminar discussion ranging from technology law and policy to the ethical challenges of representing public interest organizations. The seminar will include readings and discussions, student presentations of projects for discussion and problem-solving workshops, guest speakers on relevant topics, and other exercises designed to expose students to the practice of technology law in the public interest. Enrollment limited to eight. Permission of the instructor required. J.M. Schultz.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork-only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance; Prosecution Externship; SFALP (New Haven Corp Counsel section only).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Selection:</i> In addition to listing this course among experiential permission selections, students should also submit a statement of interest and a CV by December 11 at 4:30 p.m. Listing this course among experiential permission selections constitutes authorization for the Registrar's Office to release a copy of the student's YLS transcript to the instructor.<br/>\n<br/>",
