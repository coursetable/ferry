Topics to be considered in detail include the law of homicide; the problem of intent and of criminal responsibility for unintended acts; the law of rape; the special constitutional requirements applicable to criminal law; and the insanity defense. This course is given in several sections; it must be taken before graduation. Students may satisfy the graduation requirement by satisfactorily completing Criminal Law and Administration or Criminal Law, but they may not enroll in both courses. Enrollment limited,Scheduled examination. J. Rubenfeld.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Bidding:</i> Students who bid \u201c1\u201d for the class will of course have priority. In case of oversubscription among people bidding \u201c1\u201d (or if there are spaces left after the 1\u2019s get in), primary additional factors Professor Rubenfeld will take into account include: (a) being a third-year student and having a serious conflict with the other Criminal Law section; (b) having done research work for him in the past, especially on Criminal Law topics; and (c) having special interest in, or experience with, the subject.<br/>\n<br/>",
