    "description": "\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0International and Foreign Relations Law in Practice (21xxx). 4 units. This course will offer an opportunity to research, write about, and participate in current debates over international and foreign relations law. Students will work on research topics selected by the instructor and the class from among those presented by U.S. congressional staff, attorneys in the Legal Adviser's Office at the U.S. Department of State, other government agencies, or nonprofit groups working on issues relating to international and foreign relations law. Research projects may also be generated by the class itself. In past years, the seminar has researched a variety of topics including the law governing humanitarian intervention, the law of cyber-attack, the scope of the treaty power under the U.S. Constitution, sovereign immunity law, the law of arms trafficking, the law governing the U.S. targeted killing program, and the legal requirements of various human rights treaties. The seminar has also drafted several amicus briefs for the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. Students will work both individually and in small groups to write reports on selected topics and, where appropriate, produce recommendations for reform. Weekly class meetings provide an opportunity for students to present and discuss their ongoing research. Students will also have the opportunity to travel to Washington, D.C. to meet with attorneys and policymakers who are directly involved in the legal debates on which the class is working. Substantial Paper writing credit is available. Enrollment limited to eight. O. Hathaway.",
