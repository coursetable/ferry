    "description": "2 credit hours. Taken concurrently with 963b, this leadership practicum offers a faculty-mentored teaching experience designed to enable the student to translate evidence-based principles and practices of education content into best practices with diverse populations outside, within, and/or across a variety of local, national, and/or international health care systems or organizations. In this leadership practicum and seminar, students apply knowledge and skills learned in 963b to a teaching/learning experience mentored by D.N.P. faculty. The seminar acts as a forum for students to discuss and present their educational dilemma, design a teaching plan that is aimed at creative problem solving, and present the evaluation of the class they teach. Students select a topic related to a current issue in professional education. The topic includes a chosen teaching modality using current technology to demonstrate strategies available to educators as they consider the needs of &quot;students&quot; (target group) in various learning environments. There are two presentations, one at midterm to introduce the topic and one at the end of the teaching practicum. The final presentation occurs on-site at the end of the term. The group is expected to demonstrate their teaching practicum and their chosen modality (i.e., Skype, WEBX, Prezi, etc.). The last part of the practicum is a five-page paper that describes the chosen educational dilemma and audience, the plan for approach (description and objectives), and &quot;student&quot; evaluations as well as a critique of the chosen modality and its perceived effectiveness.",
