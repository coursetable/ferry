    "description": "\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0International Law and Foreign Relations: Seminar (20545). 4 units. This course will offer an opportunity to study, research, and participate in current legal debates over international law and foreign relations. Students will work on research topics selected by the instructor and the class from among those presented by U.S. congressional staff, executive branch lawyers, or nonprofit groups working on issues relating to international law or foreign relations. Research projects may also be generated by the class itself. In past years, the seminar has researched topics including the law of cyber-attack, the power of the U.S. government to detain terrorism suspects, the scope of the Treaty Power, the relationship between human rights law and the law of armed conflict, extraterritorial application of human rights obligations, the law governing the U.S. targeted killing program, and the legal requirements of various human rights treaties. The seminar has also submitted amicus briefs to the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. Students will work both individually and in small groups to write reports on selected topics and, as appropriate, produce recommendations for reform. Weekly class meetings provide an opportunity for students to present and discuss their ongoing research. Students will also have an opportunity to meet with attorneys and policymakers who are directly involved in the legal debates on which the class is working. Substantial Paper credit is available. Enrollment limited to eight. O.
