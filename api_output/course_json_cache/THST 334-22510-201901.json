    "description": "<p>For the actor, the call to perform alone onstage happens in many different dramaturgical contexts. Solo performance is at once an old and new art form: Homer sang the Odyssey by himself; Hamlet stands alone onstage questioning his own ontology and the nature of being in general. Priests, stand-up comedians, monologuists, TED-talkers: all solo artists. These instances demand of the actor the very specific and unusual kind of presentness that characterizes solo performance. And for the director of solo performance, the challenges are also very particular: how to establish the actor\u2019s relationship to the audience, and how to direct the audience to the actor, be it as scene partner, as confidante, as eavesdropper, as a body of concerned witnesses. This course examines all dramatic modes of aloneness onstage, all the way through from the thinking-aloud of the soliloquy, the\u00a0<em>in-medias-res</em>\u00a0monologue, the stand-up comedy routine. Text analysis is followed by the study of acting techniques in best accordance with any given text. Students have the opportunity to perform classic monologues, as well as to explore modern performance texts and comedic performance. Students are also required to take on responsibilities for directing others in focusing and shaping solo work, and therefore thinking about the way aloneness on stage signifies, in ways that are both similar and very different to traditional, multicharacter scene work.</p>",
