    "description": "City Policing: Examining Policies and Practices (21733). 2 or 3 units. This class will reflect the access to ongoing policing in New Haven provided through partnership between Yale Law School and the New Haven Police Department. Students will propose and conduct projects that involve them in the activities of the New Haven Police Department. The projects will be supervised by Dean Esserman and Professors Tracey Meares and Tom Tyler. Students interested in conducting a research project that involves policing activities should submit a proposal concerning their project and the type of access to the police department that they would like to have to conduct those projects. Past projects have included making a film about community policing; interviewing officers about disciplinary policing in different policing departments; and other projects that benefit from having cooperation with the New Haven Police Department. Students accepted for the class will work with the instructors to make a plan for their project and its final product. Professors Meares and Tyler will provide academic guidance as appropriate. Enrollment limited to five. Permission of the instructors required. T. Meares, T. Tyler, and D.
