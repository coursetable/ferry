    "description": "Advocacy for Children and Youth Clinic: Seminar (30101) and Fieldwork (30137). 2 units, credit/fail, for each part (4 units total). Students in this clinic will represent children and youth in abuse, neglect, uncared for, potentially termination of parental rights cases in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters and certain related matters. Class sessions will focus on substantive law, ethical issues arising from the representation of children and youth in the relevant contexts, interviewing and lawyering competencies, case discussions, and background materials relating to state intervention into the family. The seminar will meet weekly with occasional supplemental sessions to be arranged. Additionally, students will attend weekly case supervision sessions. Casework will require, on average, ten to twelve hours weekly, but time demands will fluctuate over the course of the term; class time will be concentrated in the first half of the term. Open only to J.D. students. Enrollment limited to four. J.K. Peters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Bidding:</i> In addition to listing this clinic among experiential course selections, interested students must submit a signed statement of understanding the commitment to continued case work until graduation by the close of early registration on December 8, at 4:30 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Due to our immediate commitments to our clients, Professor Peters will finalize the roster by email before the first class, after which the clinic cannot be dropped. Because classes prepare students for client work, attendance at all classes is mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and either of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance: Prosecution Externship.<br/>\n<br/>",
