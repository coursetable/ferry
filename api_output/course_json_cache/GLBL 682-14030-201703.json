    "description": "For the purposes of this seminar, the Arab Spring is defined as the period from December 2010 to August 2013\u2014from the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Sidi Bouzid to the violent clearing by Egyptian security forces of the Cairo squares. This period saw mass protest movements emerging in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, and Syria, with very mixed outcomes. There were popular protests and disturbances elsewhere\u2014Jordan, Bahrain, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, and Turkey. Other countries\u2014Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait\u2014were relatively unaffected domestically but remain threatened by the forces unleashed and growing regional disorder. The causes of these events, their impact, and violent aftermath have been compared to the European revolutions of 1848: profound but often unpredictable and highly differentiated. What were the structural drivers of unrest? Why did the uprisings happen where and how they did? How do they relate to previous insurgent moments in the Middle East and North Africa, and to wider global discontents? How have they changed the political landscape? What are the implications for regional security, global order, and Western policy in and toward the Arab world? Students gain a deeper understanding of this critical period in modern MENA history, structural continuities and contingent differentiation, the implications for regional and international order, the risks of political and economic failure, and a framework for thinking about the future of the region at a time when international policy engagement is perhaps weaker than it has been for decades.",
