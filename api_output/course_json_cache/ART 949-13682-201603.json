    "description": "This course borrows its title from Adrienne Rich\u2019s poem written in 1973 at the beginning of the second wave of feminism, in the wake of the civil rights movement, amid the student protests against the Vietnam War, and in reflection of the author\u2019s own process of self-discovery and personal emancipation. As a work that focuses on the isolation of life as it does on a sense of shared community, Rich\u2019s poem brings forth a perspective that there can be no understanding of the \u201cwreck\u201d without becoming one with the wreck. It is possible to see how this self-motivated, even self-legislated, impulse toward autonomy is mirrored within the very constitution of a work of art that is bound by the dialectic between autonomy and dependence, individuality and collectivity, randomness and resoluteness (Jacqueline Rose), expression and rationality (Adorno). Taking Diving into the Wreck as a point of departure, the course aims toward a cultivation of consciousness that extends self-knowledge into a sense of a community through the act of criticism. It will aspire to promote a larger collective and longer conversation around the consideration of \u201ccritical relevance\u201d with respect to and outside one\u2019s studio practice (critical practice/critical engagement) given the widened field of \u201crage\u201d and a largely dehumanizing backdrop \u2013 with a staggering increase in social and economic inequality as well as a rise in and support for authoritarian populist political movements, in the ease with which a vocabulary of narrow ethno-nationalisms is applied, with the emergence of what Adorno foresaw as \u201cauthoritarian personalities\u201d who, in turn, expound on racist and xenophobic agendas, with continued violent oppression that calls for a new language in feminism, with the proliferation of racially motivated police violence and incarceration, state violence, and among others prescient issues, the question of human sexuality no longer located, according to the writer and activist Jennifer Finney Boylan, \u201cabout who you want to go to bed with, but it\u2019s who you want to go to bed as.\u201d Wednesdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm 204 EDG36 First Class: September 7, 2016 Required for First Year Graduate Students Yale School of Art",
