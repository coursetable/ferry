    "description": "<p>An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, <a href=\"/search/?p=THST%20491\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:THST 491\" >THST 491</a>, even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before\u2014not after\u2014the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period.</p>\n<p>An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work.</p>\n<p>Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Juniors may use one term of these courses to prepare for their senior projects.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Open to juniors and seniors.
