    "description": "Criminal Law Theory: Directed Research (21467). 1 to 3 units. This seminar will help students develop research papers in criminal law theory or the philosophy of criminal law, while enjoying input from peers with similar interests. Any paper topic in these areas is welcome. Paper required. Enrollment limited to eight. Permission of the instructor required. G. Yaffe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students will meet individually with the instructor but also will meet as a group several times to present their work to each other. The group meeting dates and times will be arranged to accommodate students' schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Bidding:</i> In addition to listing this course among permission-of-instructor selections, students should submit a description of a topic in criminal law theory or the philosophy of criminal law that they are interested in spending the semester researching. A successful proposal might identify a specific thesis for which the student wishes to argue, or a specific hypothesis the student wishes to explore, but it might also identify a relatively circumscribed set of issues about which the student hopes to read with the aim of developing a narrower paper topic. Professor Yaffe will select students based on how promising he thinks the topic is, and how likely he is to be able to help the student to write a paper about it. Students should submit their statements/descriptions by June 20 at 4:30 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>",
