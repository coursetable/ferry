    "description": "The United Nations is the world\u2019s preeminent organization for maintaining international peace and security and for responding to international crises. Since the end of the Cold War, the world has increasingly turned to the UN to deploy operations into some of the most difficult and dangerous conflicts, sometimes to keep the peace but often to manage ongoing conflicts. There are currently twenty-nine UN peace operations, costing the world more than $8 billion per year. Given the importance of this UN role, one must ask if the UN is performing it well. This course takes an in-depth and behind-the-scenes look at how the UN designs, deploys, manages, and measures the performance of its peace operations. The course considers the nature of conflict, the degree to which UN operations are tailored to specific circumstances, and the implied assumptions embedded in the UN\u2019s approach, particularly around the issue of social contracts. We delve into such practical issues as strategy setting, planning and mission design, and the role of and relationship between key stakeholders\u2014notably the Security Council, the UN Secretariat, and major troop-contributing countries. Throughout the course we look at the real-world experience of different UN peace operations, including those in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, and South Sudan, as well as two unique missions: the OPCW-UN Syrian Chemical Weapons Mission and the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. We end with an assessment of the reform proposals put forward by the UN Secretary-General and seek to elucidate what other measures might better equip the UN to fulfill its vital role in the maintenance of international peace and security.",
