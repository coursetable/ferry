    "description": "The course rereads the lyric poetry of Dante as a sort of diary of the intellectual and creative history of the poet beginning from his early youth to his maturity. We will examine the texts by looking at the relationships and exchanges between Dante and the poets of his circle, together with the poetic, rhetorical, and philosophical problems that such poetry faced. We will also read texts of the Italian lyrical tradition from the poets of the Sicilian school to Petrarch, Boccaccio and the Platonic Academy of Florence. Our choice includes texts of Italian poetry mostly written in the 13th ,14th, 15 th and 16th centuries and explores at first the role that poetry has played in medieval Italy evaluating the contribution given by the Arabic culture in establishing such a role. Looking at the reshaping of the curricula studiorum as it took place in the European Universities beginning from the 13th century, the course explores the new idea of learning and its organization focusing on the notion of poetry as it is derived from the appearance of new translations from the Arabic and from the Aristotelian encyclopedia. The interaction between the old learning and the new learning will be one of the foci of the course. The relationship between multiculturalism and intellectual history as well as that between poetry, poetics and politics are among the topics that will be discussed. Imagination, its definition and function, passions, emotions in light of Aristotle and Aristotelianism and the theory of internal senses, will be the core of the course. The medieval Neoplatonism and the Platonism of the Quattrocento, and Petrarchism will be part of what will be discussed during the semester. In Italian",
