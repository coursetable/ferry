    "description": "<p>Preparation of a yearlong senior project under the supervision of a member of the faculty. There will be a mandatory meeting at the beginning of the term for students who have chosen the yearlong senior project; students will be notified of the time and location by e-mail before classes begin. Majors planning to begin their projects who do not receive this notice should contact the senior project director.</p>\n<p>Students expecting to graduate in May enroll in HSHM 490 during the fall term and complete their projects in <a href=\"/search/?p=HSHM%20491\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HSHM 491\" >HSHM 491</a> in the spring term.

Majors planning to begin their projects in the spring term should notify the senior project director by the last day of classes in the fall term. Students must meet progress requirements by specific deadlines throughout the first term to receive a temporary grade of SAT for HSHM 490, which will be changed to the grade received by the project upon the project's completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student's being asked to withdraw from HSHM 490.
