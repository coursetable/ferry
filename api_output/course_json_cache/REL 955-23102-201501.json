    "description": "The seminar examines modern concepts of Jewish space, concentrating on how people have imagined, constructed, or enacted space in Jewish life from the nineteenth century to the present. The course is structured around three themes: the characteristic blend of the secular and sacred; the relation between space and time; and the relation between Jews and others. The types of spaces considered range from the secular to the ritual, memorial, and spiritual. Thus, ways in which spaces are constructed or conceived to include or exclude Jews are considered, as are spaces where people mingle with one another in imagination or reality. The themes overlap, particularly in cases where concepts of time merge with concepts of space, as in spaces, such as the <i>Eruv,</i> that are activated only at certain times. Examples of spaces treated include synagogues (modern buildings and ancient objects of modern scholarship), <i>Eruvim,</i> prison (or concentration) camps, baseball fields, Jewish museums, and Eretz Israel. Readings include theorists of space such as Henri Lefebvre or Michel de Certeau as well as writers associated (as primary or secondary sources) with the particular case studies. Area V.",
