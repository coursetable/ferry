May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Engineering and Applied Science; Geology and Geophysics; Chemistry; Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry; Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; Physics; or any other science department sponsoring such programs. These programs are especially useful for juniors in providing them with actual research experience prior to application to graduate or professional schools. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty sponsor, who should also supply a l- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. Students taking Independent Research for 1 credit must work 35 hours a week for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students must work 35 hours a week for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,600. Session A: June 1 - July 3.",
