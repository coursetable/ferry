    "description": "Work and Gender (21577). 5 units. This course will examine how workplaces, jobs, and workers come to be structured along gendered lines. The class will read theoretical accounts, empirical studies, ethnographies, and legal cases to obtain an understanding of the mechanisms through which work becomes gendered. Among the questions the course will address are: Does the workplace reflect or rather actively reproduce gendered social relations and identities? What is the relationship among wage work, citizenship, and gender? How do structural features of organizations tend to reproduce sex segregation and gender harassment? How should we understand the relationship between gender and sexuality at work? Which theories ground past and present interpretations of the law's ban on sex discrimination? Which theories should do so? The representation of gender and work in the popular media will also be explored, through an accompanying, required in-class film series. Scheduled examination (web). V. Schultz. Please note: The regular class meetings will be on Monday and Tuesday, 4:10-6 p.m., but films related to the class will be shown between 6 and 9 p.m. on either Monday or Tuesday. Students interested in this course should plan their class schedules accordingly so that they are available between 4 and 9 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays.",
