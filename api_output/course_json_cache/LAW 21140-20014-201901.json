    "description": "Advanced Procedure: Conflict of Laws (21140). 3 or 4 units. This class is designed for people who want to expand upon what they learned in <i>Civil Procedure.</i> It will address issues that most Civil Procedure courses don\u2019t have enough time to consider fully and that are also not covered in Federal Courts or Complex Litigation. Personal jurisdiction, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the doctrine of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, and multidistrict litigation are therefore <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">not</span> covered.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a large degree the subject matter is the same as the course usually called \u201cConflict of Laws\u201d; the course thus includes the constitutional law and the common law limits on the reach of state legislative authority (\u201cchoice of law\u201d) as well as interstate judgments enforcement. But there are additional topics, such as the reach of federal statutory law overseas; choice of law questions arising from splits in the circuits; and the choice of law implications of venue transfer and forum non conveniens. The material is a mix of the intensely practical and the absurdly theoretical. The assigned readings are in Brilmayer, Goldsmith, and O\u2019Hara O\u2019Connor, <i>Cases and Materials on the Conflicts of Laws</i> (7th ed.) plus some supplementary materials that will be distributed. The course is offered for three units (by examination or paper) or for four units (by long research paper, such as an SAW). Self-scheduled examination or paper option. L. Brilmayer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Although not formally calculated into the grade, class participation is considered by the instructor to be an important element of this class. Students will be asked to sign up for being \u201con call\u201d at least once in the semester, and for being a \u201cdiscussant\u201d at least one additional time. (A discussant signs up for a particular class meeting and then is expected to have observations, questions, etc., to volunteer at some point of his or her choosing.)<br/>\n<br/>",
