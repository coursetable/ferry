    "description": "4 credits. NP. Group B. This course in the analysis of contemporary repertoire focuses on helping students gain a thorough understanding of certain pieces written by living or recently deceased composers, ranging from Sofia Gubaidulina's <i>Feast during a Plague</i> and Mauricio Kagel's <i>Les id\u00e9es fixes</i> and <i>Musik f\u00fcr Renaissance-Instrumente,</i> to selected piano pieces of Frederic Rzewski. The goal is to become flexible using analytical tools that are fluid enough to be sensitive to each work, in order to arrive at a deep and thorough understanding of each piece. It is impossible to use only one analytical method when considering contemporary music, because there is no common syntax among pieces that would allow for a descriptive theory. It is therefore my goal to present various ways of analyzing non-tonal music. I talk about a range of tools, from a modified post-Schenkerian theory of linearity and directionality, to various strands of neo-Riemannian theory as presented by David Lewin, Richard Cohn, and others. Recent work by Alexander Rehding is touched upon, and we visit selections from <i>The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Riemannian Music Theories</i>. We also read, among other analyses, David Lewin's <i>Musical Form and Transformation</i>. The main goal of the course, however, is to develop our own ways of thinking about and understanding contemporary music. So while readings of existing analyses and methods for analysis prove useful in promoting fluency with critical and connective thinking, students are challenged to be adaptive in their methods to respond to specific contexts and syntaxes, which can change not only piece to piece, but within a single work.",
