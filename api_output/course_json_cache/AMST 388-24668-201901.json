    "description": "<p>The course explores Baldwin\u2019s oeuvre since 1964 until his death in 1987. As critics have noted, there has been a renaissance regarding the work of James Baldwin since 1999, with scholarly publications devoted to his work, public tributes, films, and publications of previously uncollected or out of print works. Critics had hailed Baldwin\u2019s earlier works\u2014<em>Go Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni\u2019s Room, Notes of a Native Son</em>\u2014as his greatest literary accomplishments. After Baldwin\u2019s most celebrated work\u2014<em>The Fire Next Time\u2014</em>Baldwin appeared on the cover of\u00a0<em>Time\u00a0</em>magazine in 1963, under the heading \u201cBirmingham and Beyond: The Negro\u2019s Push for Equality.\u201d In this moment, Baldwin became a celebrated public figure in the U.S. and beyond. Our class investigates the period after this height of celebrity, when critics lambasted him for being too political, too angry, too bitter, and losing narrative control and rigor. This two-decade span is significant because Baldwin was witness to the deaths and incarceration of Civil Rights leaders (whom he mourned as friends), the increased surveillance and incarceration of black activists, the Vietnam war, the emergence of Black Power, feminist movements, and gay and queer liberations. During this time, Baldwin lived primarily in Turkey and France, and continued to travel globally. Baldwin\u2019s essays, novels, speeches, and poetry wrestled with how to formally capture and witness the violences of imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Since his death, Baldwin\u2019s work has continued to influence and inform theoretical insights in American studies, literary studies, Black studies, and queer studies. Our class engages with Baldwin\u2019s formal practices, political contexts, and critical interpretations across these fields.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Preference given to students with a background in African American Studies, WGGS, ERM, and American Studies. Previous readings of James Baldwin's works recommended but not required.\u00a0</p>",
