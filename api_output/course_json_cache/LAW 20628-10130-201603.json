    "description": "Strategic Impact Litigation: Constitutional and Civil Rights Issues (20628). 2 units. This seminar will explore strategic and doctrinal issues related to the role of impact litigation to advance civil and constitutional rights in today's legal environment. The course will draw on the instructor's decades of experience litigating immigration and civil rights law reform and class action cases in federal courts nationwide as founder and director of the ACLU's national Immigrants Rights' Project, as well as recent service in the federal government as a senior advisor and legal counsel defending litigation brought against the government. The course will explore the intersection of theory and practice in the context of various civil rights issues, such as LGBT equality, police practices, immigrants' rights and other social justice matters. Topics will include ethical considerations, bringing test cases, contemporary doctrinal restrictions on standing and class actions, strategic pleading, structural reform litigation, the role of amicus briefs; suits for damages versus injunctive relief; settlement strategies and issues; coalition litigation; public advocacy and media, and the perspective of government lawyers.
