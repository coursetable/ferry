    "description": "What is the role of art in a capitalist society? How does the artistic production of an era reflect its social, economic, and moral conditions? What is the relationship between mankind and nature or the environment? How does the workman relate to the products of his labor? How can beauty be defined and understood? What is the place of religion in social and aesthetic thought? What do we mean by truth in relation to visual representation? These are among the questions that preoccupied John Ruskin, one of the protean figures of the nineteenth century, yet one whose work raises significant issues for our own time. The course aims to provide a full overview of Ruskin's significance, across a wide disciplinary and historical terrain, in the light of recent critical responses to his work. Far from being merely an art critic, Ruskin was a figure whose impact was felt across the fields of art history, aesthetic theory, museology, theology, architectural history and practice, literature, social criticism, politics, economics, geology, botany, climatology, and every aspect of Victorian life. His prose works run to thirty-nine large volumes, and his voluminous correspondence and diaries fill many more. Gifted as a draftsman, he produced a large corpus of watercolors and drawings. The class examines the many facets of Ruskin's work, aiming to place each in historical context while also exploring the relevance of his ideas for our contemporary world. The class concludes with a study trip to the UK and Venice. Enrollment limited.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: permission of the instructor.</p>",
