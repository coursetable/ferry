    "description": "The MD/PhD Program is developing a compact ethics refresher course which will satisfy the NIH requirement that graduate students who are supported on training grants and who have been enrolled full-time for longer than 4 years receive a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009crefresher\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d course in the responsible conduct of research. This pertains to MD-PhD students, who are typically enrolled in the Program for up to 8 years, and who are working in PhD labs beginning in year 4 of their enrollment. The NIH has specifically informed the MD/PhD Program that it needs to administer its own \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009crefresher\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d course. In addition to subject matter requirements, it is essential that accurate attendance records are maintained for each source of funding. The course will be perceived as an elective, but in essence is mandatory for all MD/PhD students. The grading will be Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. Members of the MD/PhD Program\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Faculty Committee will lead the discussions. The proposed course is anticipated to be held in a one-half day workshop beginning in the Spring 2014 semester, with the participation of Yale faculty members. The course format will be lecture with group discussion and case studies. It will also be co-listed with the Graduate School to ensure application to the transcripts of the MD/PhD students. The topics to be covered are: Topic Conflict of Interest Policies Regarding Human Subjects, Live Vertebrate Animal Subjects in Research and Laboratory Practice Mentor/Mentee Responsibilities and Relationships &amp; Research Misconduct and Policies for Handling Misconduct Collaborative Research Including Collaborations with Industry &amp; Data Acquisition and Laboratory Tools; Management, Sharing and Ownership Peer Review &amp; Responsible Authorship and Publication The Scientist as a Responsible Member of Society, Contemporary Ethical Issues In Biomedical Research, and the Environmental and Social Impacts of Scientific Research We are looking at the current schedule to determine a date/time for this refresher course.",
