    "description": "<p>In this course, we discuss the interconnection between several important subjects in mathematics, including moduli theory, integrable hierarchies, graphs on surfaces, complex geometry, and singularity theory, using certain ideas from theoretical physics as a main thread.\u00a0The first part of the course is mainly devoted to studying moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, which are fundamental objects in complex analysis, geometric topology, algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and mathematical physics. We introduce their Deligne-Mumford compactifications, consider some of their natural cohomology classes, and study the intersection numbers between them. This part culminates with discussion of Witten\u2019s conjecture on a two-dimensional quantum gravity model that a certain generating function of the intersection numbers should satisfy the differential equations of the KdV hierarchy. For this, we provide a quick overview of integrable hierarchies and then sketch Kontsevich\u2019s proof of the conjecture.\u00a0In the second part of the course, we discuss mathematics of topological string theory, especially of what is usually referred to as the B-model in the subject. Mathematically speaking, this amounts to the study of complex algebraic geometry and Hodge theory of Calabi-Yau manifolds on the one hand and singularity theory on the other. Our aim is to understand both subjects in a uniform and coherent way, as motivated by ideas of topological string theory. Our treatment is built on the rigorous mathematical frameworks developed by several people in and around the subject of mirror symmetry, including Barannikov, Dubrovin, Givental, Kontsevich, and K. Saito. Class material is entirely mathematical and in particular does not assume any background on physics; physics will be used only as a guiding principle for the choice of topics and a presentation. On the other hand, the course assumes basic knowledge of complex analysis, algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry; references are provided for those who are less prepared but willing to spend extra time to follow the course.</p>",
