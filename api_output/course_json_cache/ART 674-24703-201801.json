    "description": "This course will be centered on the nature of what could be termed \u201cprocess\u201d in art-making practice and problem solving. It will involve examination and discussion of said process as it relates to time, speed, access, and subverting the role of expectation and \u201cexecution\u201d in making and thinking.The nature of speed with regards to technology is a known and traveled path. The tools surrounding this phenomenon include prostheses ranging from improved tools, machinery, and casting methods, to digital scanning and production technologies, and even remote imaging and satellite navigation. The promise of this speed as it relates to efficiency in the name of progress could be said to be increasing at an alarming rate. With these enhanced tools for art-making and art-thinking, however, might it be possible to imagine an increase in opportunities to consider alternative outcomes and follow innovative and unexamined combinations and pathways towards problem solving? What does this mean to us and where do we situate our own practices (art and otherwise) with regards to expectation and initially charted routes? Using a backdrop of geologic deep-time to both locate us and serve as a foil to this illusion of speed and access, our group will meet in and (primarily) outside of the studio/classroom to see a variety and range of unconventional makers and problem solvers. Involving field trips and two presentations, the atmosphere of this course will be discursive with attention paid to research and observation. Primarily aimed at Sculpture and MFA graduate students, emphasis will be placed upon developing in-studio (and extra-studio) strategies for observing and improving non-linearity in art-making and problem solving in the individuals\u2019 practices through active engagement with their own processes. We will meet seven times through the course of the semester, culminating with a final presentation developed in conjunction with myself. Tuesdays (1/23, 2/6, 2/20, 3/27, 4/10, 4/24), 2 pm to 5 pm 1.5 Credits Please note: at least one of our meetings will take place outside of the scheduled Tuesday class time.",
