    "description": "Political and Civil Rights in Canada and the United States (21211). 2 units. Canada and the United States share more than an international border: both were colonies of Great Britain; both are federal systems; both countries' legal systems reflect an English common law heritage; and both are modern, industrialized societies. Canada did not, however, adopt a written bill of rights or institute the practice of judicial review until 1982. Prior to that time, its legal system operated according to principles of parliamentary supremacy. This comparative constitutional law seminar will explore the similarities and differences, both before and after Canada's 1982 constitutional change, between the two legal systems with respect to protection of individual rights. Attention will be given to the issues of hate speech, language rights, abortion, pornography and obscenity, religious liberty, affirmative action, criminal justice, press freedom, and the impact of international human rights norms on domestic decision-making. Paper required. Enrollment limited to fifteen. Permission of the instructor required. D.S. Days, III.
