    "description": "<p>Economists usually praise free trade as a desirable policy. Although it has been understood for many years that trade can lead to winners and losers, the inequality effects of trade have typically been dismissed because they were thought to be small or unimportant. Recent evidence on the labor market effects of globalization has shown that increases in trade exposure can lead to substantial disruption in the labor market, which can last for decades and lead to persistent distributional effects. Since the benefits from trade are not equally shared, skepticism toward globalization has soared. This sentiment has led to a recent anti-globalization wave, with important political consequences.\u00a0In this seminar, we discuss the theory behind the labor market effects of trade, and, more importantly, what we know about how labor markets have responded to trade shocks, such as the emergence of China as a major international player, and trade liberalization episodes in developing countries over the past thirty years.\u00a0The seminar is based on discussion of recent academic papers on the topic, which is experiencing an explosion of interest and research. We make heavy use of microeconomics and econometrics. Key concepts in these disciplines are refreshed throughout the course.</p>",
