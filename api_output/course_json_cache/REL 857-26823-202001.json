    "description": "<p>This course explores the experience of contemporary spiritual direction from the standpoint of both the director and the one directed. It situates the contemporary ministry of spiritual direction within the history of the Christian tradition and explores the theology, focus, process, and current models of spiritual direction. Spiritual direction has long been considered a charismatic gift of the Spirit. The course promotes reflection on the student\u2019s prior experience of spiritual direction as a way of making explicit the model(s) of spiritual direction one may have experienced and their effect on spiritual growth. <em>This course does not qualify a student to offer spiritual direction,</em> but it will facilitate discernment about whether seeking further cultivation/refinement of a charism (a practicum) in spiritual direction is indicated. In addition to studying the history and models of spiritual direction, the course gives considerable attention to the importance and meaning-making aspects of the narrative process inherent in spiritual direction. It also explores a theology of religious experience, including the key theological themes of sin, conversion, and discipleship of Jesus that are central to this process for Christians. Additionally, students consider how spiritual direction supports the development of prayer as well as briefly treat discernment of spirits and the qualities and competencies desired in a spiritual director/guide/companion. Finally, the course gives attention to how the societal and environmental context of a directee\u2019s life situation can be explored so that spiritual direction supports action toward social justice as it emerges from the directee\u2019s own experience.
