    "description": "This program is open to students returning for a second supervised ministry internship. This internship can be arranged as a second year at the same site or at a different site to provide another type of contextual experience. Like the first supervised ministry, the second internship, under the mentorship of a trained supervisor, is combined with a peer reflection group (Practicum) facilitated by a practitioner, for a total of four hundred hours over the two terms. The internship is guided by a learning covenant that is developed by the student in collaboration with the supervisor. In some cases where a site does not have a theologically trained supervisor, the student may also receive supervision from a theological mentor assigned by the director of the OSM. In addition to performing typical internship responsibilities, each intern creates a unique major project that involves substantive research and is presented to other students in the advanced practicum. The Part-time Internship with Advanced Practicum carries three credits each term. Completion of both terms is required before credit is granted.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Successful completion of one supervised ministry internship is a prerequisite.</p>",
