    "description": "4 credits. NP. Group B. This class focuses on the extraordinary music written by Franz Schubert in his last year of life. We analyze and discuss this music in great depth, with the goal of arriving at a thorough and sensitive understanding of it from an analytical and historical perspective. Pieces include the Quintet in C Major, the last three Piano Sonatas, the Mass in E-flat Major, and several of the late songs. The primary purpose of the class is to gain an intimate and firsthand knowledge and understanding of Schubert's late music, so while some reading is assigned, the main emphasis is on doing our own analyses of this music. Readings are drawn from various sources, including Susan Wollenberg's <i>Schubert's Fingerprints: Studies in the Instrumental Works,</i> Leo Black's <i>Franz Schubert: Music and Belief,</i> Otto Erich Deutsch's <i>Schubert: A Documentary Biography</i> (trans. Eric Blom), and Suzannah Clark's article &quot;Schubert, Theory and Analysis.&quot; Analytical methods used draw upon (but are not limited to) some aspects of Schenker's theory. As a reference point, we also review concepts of classical form, which help elucidate some of Schubert's innovations and specific proportional features in the music. Course requirements include two substantive (20 pages) papers, one due at midterm, the other at the end of the term, detailing the student's analyses of late Schubert; students choose which piece(s) to analyze, with approval of the instructor. Students are expected to participate fully in class discussions and to have prepared for each class by listening to and studying the score to each piece to be discussed.",
