    "description": "<p>This course is about the strategies and tactics used by successful environmental campaigns, taught\u00a0from a practitioner\u2019s perspective. It is also a course about environmental policy making. Policy\u00a0doesn\u2019t just happen the way it\u2019s described in grade school civics textbooks. And it isn\u2019t just\u00a0policy makers who make it. Corporate and civic interests play an influential role at all levels of\u00a0policy making. As future participants in the policy process, whether you come from a perch in government or business, as an advocate, or as a private citizen, you can jump-start your ability to\u00a0participate and respond by understanding how policy campaign advocacy impacts policy making. Though this topic is neither well documented nor regularly taught, there is a toolkit that can be\u00a0learned. Most environmental campaigners and policy makers learn about policy campaigning on the job. This course attempts to advance understanding of the policy-making process by exposing students to case examples from the environmental policy-making world of the past decade. The\u00a0course examines selected case examples of successful policy campaigns and seeks to tease out\u00a0lessons and best practice. No single environmental campaign is the same, and strategies and\u00a0tactics are always evolving, but there are key lessons about campaign practices that can be learned. Case studies we examine include campaigns enacting anti-toxic legislation in\u00a0Washington State; stopping the Keystone XL Pipeline; retiring coal-fired power plants in the United States; protecting the Great Bear Rainforest and the boreal forest in Canada; banning the use of high-sulphur fuels in the Arctic; securing an international ban on Arctic ocean fishing; catalyzing the decarbonization of supply chain emissions at Levi\u2019s; pushing Starbucks to adopt a recyclable,\u00a0compostable coffee cup; and encouraging banks and insurers to commit to Paris-aligned lending\u00a0and financing. Campaigners who played leadership roles in these efforts join us for class. We examine each case, seek a practical understanding of strategies and tactics used by each\u00a0campaign, and attempt to synthesize lessons and best practice.</p>",
