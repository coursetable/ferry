    "description": "Classical literature has bequeathed us the names of many celebrated Greek artists, from Pheidias, who made the colossal statue of Olympian Zeus, to Apelles, the court painter of Alexander the Great. Strikingly, very few works by these &quot;Old Masters&quot; survive in the archaeological record. This course tackles the problems that arise from the gap that exists between famous artists known to us from the ancient textual tradition and the mass of objects that survive by lesser-known, often anonymous makers. Is it appropriate to apply the concept of the &quot;artist&quot; (rather than &quot;craftsman&quot;) to ancient material culture? What evidence is there for actual artistic production in the Greek and Roman world, and what can this tell us about ancient artists? What light does antiquity throw on the modern category of the &quot;artist&quot;? How useful is literary evidence for traditional art historical practices of attribution and connoisseurship, in the case of antiquity? Covering the period from Archaic Greece until the early Roman Empire, we explore the role, status, agency, and identity of the ancient artist across a variety of media, including vase painting, metal work, marble and bronze sculpture, and engraved gems. This course is taught as part of the Yale-Cornell Consortium for the Study of Ancient Art, in conjunction with a course at Cornell University taught by Verity Platt. In March 2016, we will meet our Cornell colleagues in Washington, D.C., where we will attend the exhibition <i>Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World,</i> and students will present their work to each other in an informal workshop.",
