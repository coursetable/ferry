    "description": "<p>Science and technology make progress possible at a speed and scale that were unimaginable even ten years ago. New sophistication in advanced computing, the\u00a0availability of data, growing interconnectedness of systems and society, and the rise of cross-disciplinary fields of study each could create opportunity and improve quality of life for billions of people. Some authoritarian societies such as China have already used these techniques as a launching pad for economic development and global influence. How can free societies respond at a time when their own economic models are under threat? What will it take for liberal democracies to develop a true strategy on AI; import and preserve a truly global network of talent; transform institutions of higher learning; and restore faith in the economic models at a time of great disruption? This seminar explores how liberal democracies can use science and technology to compete to win. In addition to participating in the general discussion, each student prepares and leads a class discussion on a topic the student proposed during the application period. At the end of term, the class develops a series of recommendations on research questions to explore further and meets with\u00a0leaders seeking advice on potential paths forward for their societies. Permission of the instructor required. <em>Application deadline: Friday, January 4, at midnight.</em></p>",
