    "description": "<p>This seminar, which takes its title from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy\u2019s 1925 book, treats the concept of medium-specificity as it applies to painting, photography, film, and related media. It centers on photography and its historically vexed relationship to painting and the modernist discourses of medium purity, autonomy, and self-reflexivity, but it also takes up the history of those discourses as they relate to other media and as they are troubled by the hybridity of the photograph. Beginning with the philosophical origins of the distinction between literature and the visual arts, the seminar considers Clement Greenberg\u2019s polemics on painting, sculpture, and collage and his occasional forays into photographic criticism. It addresses attempts at developing an ontology of the photograph (Roland Barthes\u2019s <em>Camera Lucida</em> most particularly), as well as criticisms of those attempts. It also addresses revisions of the definition of photography, as well as multimedia, inter-media, post-medium, and new media discourses. Finally, it looks at declarations and predictions of the death of painting, the end of photography, and the mutation of film into a digital medium. Readings in key theoretical and critical texts set in relation to particular practices in painting, drawing, and photography; discussions, oral presentations, and final papers.</p>",
