    "description": "Like the Part-time Internship with Practicum, the Specialized Internship in Youth Ministry is taken for two consecutive terms starting in September and requires a total of four hundred hours over the two terms. Internship sites are churches with youth programs approved by the Youth Ministry Institute of YDS and OSM. The internship is undertaken by students working in pairs and is under the mentorship of a trained youth ministry leader, with additional theological mentoring provided by the senior pastoral staff of the host site. The weekly peer reflection group (Practicum) is composed of students in youth ministry internships and is facilitated by Youth Ministry Institute professionals. The internship is guided by a learning covenant that is developed by the student in collaboration with the supervisor and theological mentor. In addition, this specialized internship includes a pre-internship team orientation, on-site team coaching, monthly meetings with youth ministry professionals, and a midyear retreat. The Specialized Internship in Youth Ministry carries three credits each term. Completion of both terms is required before credit is granted. Placements are selected during the preceding spring term.",
