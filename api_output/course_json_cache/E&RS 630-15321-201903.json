    "description": "<p>Central Eastern European performance and theater artists were subjected to the permanent surveillance of the dictatorial regimes\u2019 secret police and informant networks during the decades of communism and state socialism. Art events, as nests of revolutionary ideas and active resistance, were considered especially threatening for the repressive ideological state. State security networks infiltrated the art world through their often violently recruited secret informants, who were obligated to inform the state about every detail of the art events and the community\u2014from the most mundane, everyday interactions to the more suspicious oppositional actions and utterances. This course focuses on the last two decades of the cold war and analyzes the ways in which performance and theater artists from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and East Germany navigated the permanent surveillance of the state security networks. After the introduction of foundational texts on the theory and history of surveillance, including Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, and Gilles Deleuze, readings and discussions focus on the specificities of Soviet-type surveillance within the art world. We analyze both the strategies with which the repressive state apparatus aimed to discipline and control artistic expression, and the tactics with which artists subverted the policing gaze. Then we turn our focus to the present and study recent artworks that\u2014through the recontextualization of the files excavated in the historical archives of the state security\u2014either reconstruct the often invisible operations of the state security network or commemorate the enduring experience of living under such violently devious state control. We conclude by considering contemporary artists\u2019 works that expose and critique the neoliberal, postcapitalist surveillance practices that threaten privacy rights globally. Although the main focus of the course is Central and Eastern Europe, we discuss the tactics of surveillance and the subversive artistic practices in a transnational, comparative context, studying artworks and surveillance files that originated in either the post-dictatorial Latin American states or the U.S. Civil Rights movement.</p>",
