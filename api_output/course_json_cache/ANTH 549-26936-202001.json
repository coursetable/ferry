    "description": "<p style=\"margin-left:.5in\">Who and what counts as a person? How do we know? When and how is personhood attributed? To what extent does place, and the hemispheric formation that is the Americas, shape personhood? Can personhood be \u201clost\u201d? Is personhood only for the living, or is it a question for the dead too? What forms of self-fashioning does personhood require, and how have these changed across space and time? How do individuals construct selves and public personas according to socially accepted standards? This course is designed to offer a broad and historically grounded understanding of key interdisciplinary debates and themes associated with understandings of personhood, its social implications, and the relationship between the embodied self and collective identities. Topics include the role of the nation state, the law, and science in defining persons; rites of passage in the life cycle of persons, particularly at the beginning and end of life; the legibility and performance of personhood and self through language, cultivation, and person-person or person-nonperson relationships; \u201cdegrees\u201d of personhood in relation to gender, race, class, and illness; incarceration and confinement and their relation to a \u201closs\u201d of personhood; and transnational, institutional, and psychoanalytic productions of the person. Approaching the Americas from a hemispheric perspective, the course also aims to help students identify the methodological, ethical, and theoretical questions that come with using concepts such as person, individual, self, and subject and to assess the methodological and analytical advantages and/or disadvantages of one term over the other for specific research projects in specific fieldwork sites. Whom we consider a person, whom we label less than fully endowed, and the roles history, culture, and context play in the process are questions that inform some of the most urgent legal and political issues of our time. We look at texts in philosophy, anthropology, history, psychology, law, and popular culture.</p>",
