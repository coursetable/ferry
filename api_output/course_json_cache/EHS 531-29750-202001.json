    "description": "<p class=\"BodyA\">Over the past few years, there have been growing concerns about a possible \u201creproducibility crisis\u201d in research. Every year, several million new research papers are published, and in biomedicine alone, the number has been increasing exponentially. The rapid accumulation of scientific studies provides an opportunity to conduct meta-research, which is the field that focuses on performing research on existing research. Meta-research, which cuts across all disciplines and relies on a wide range of methodological approaches, involves studying the methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives related to research. While individual meta-analyses, which generally involve combining data from multiple studies for specific exposure-outcome relationships, fall under the umbrella of \u201cmeta-research,\u201d this course is focused on the methods used to evaluate multiple studies (or meta-analyses) across multiple topics. The overall goals of meta-research are to assess key research characteristics and to determine how to improve research practices and evidentiary standards. This course covers some meta-analytical methodology, similar to <a href=\"/search/?p=CDE%20650\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:CDE 650\"  class=\"notoffered\">CDE 650</a>. However, unlike a traditional \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d course, where students complete a systematic review/meta-analysis, this course is designed to accommodate diverse student projects that deal with research methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Overall, the course provides students with the tools to (1) evaluate the quality, validity, and reproducibility of research; and (2) preregister, design, conduct, and publish a theoretical or empirical meta-research study, following the best open-science practices. Meta-research studies can be conducted across all scientific fields, from preclinical/animal research to the social sciences. Key topics include the philosophy of science; scientific biases and bias assessment; designing and conducting a meta-research project; meta-analytical methodology; database searches; and open-science practices. The class consists of lectures and labs/discussions. Students design a meta-research project in their own field. The goal is to have students work on a project that will be suitable for a thesis and/or eventual publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\"></p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">Prerequisite: one graduate-level biostatistics (e.g., <a href=\"/search/?p=BIS%20505\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:BIS 505\" >BIS 505</a>) or epidemiology (e.g., <a href=\"/search/?p=EPH%20508\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:EPH 508\"  class=\"notoffered\">EPH 508</a>) course.</p>",
