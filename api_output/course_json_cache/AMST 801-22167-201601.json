    "description": "This seminar introduces students to recent works on some of the more important intellectual movements in twentieth-century U.S. history and explores the widely different contextualist approaches that historians have taken toward them. Our first set of questions focuses on the intellectuals as a social type or formation: How did they mobilize themselves and others differently over the course of the century as the institutional ground shifted beneath their feet, the culture industries multiplied, and the communication revolution unfolded? How should we understand the real and imagined spaces that intellectuals fashioned for themselves and the impact of those geographies upon their identities and ideas? What effects have the changing forms of intellectual collaboration had on the genesis, refinement, and articulation of ideas in this country? Our second set of questions focuses on some of the ideas, ideologies, paradigms, &quot;imaginaries,&quot; and intellectual identities that took hold over the course of the century, with a view toward comparing the different visions in relation to one another and against the circumstances of their efflorescence. One short and one long paper.",
