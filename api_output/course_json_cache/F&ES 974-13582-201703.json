    "description": "4 credits. Students have the opportunity to help launch Yale Law School\u2019s new environmental justice clinic, which will be in its second term, and to develop a docket to improve environmental quality and public health in communities of color and low-income communities. In the wake of a national conversation about the water crisis in Flint and lead poisoning across the country, students will be in on the ground floor as the clinic takes on cases to address inequality in the distribution of health hazards as well as procedural inequities they face as they try to assert their own vision for the future of their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. The clinic\u2019s work includes cases and advocacy projects to enforce civil rights in the environmental context, and, in the new political climate, work with clients to develop legal and advocacy strategies to address issues of environmental injustice in particular communities. In addition to civil rights compliance and enforcement in the environmental context, the clinic evaluates potential litigation and advocacy to address the sources and impacts of air and water contamination in disproportionately affected communities, with a focus on communities in Connecticut. Students also participate in a seminar intended to explore issues raised by the clinical practice, including both substantive issues of environmental and civil rights law, as well as questions related to practice, including ethical and social dimensions of lawyering in this context. The seminar meets approximately two hours per week. In addition to class meetings and preparation, students must complete and document approximately fifteen hours of clinical work per week. They are also expected to participate in two weekly one-half-hour team meetings. While there is no prerequisite for the clinic, participants should have a strong interest in working on behalf of environmentally overburdened communities\u2014often communities of color and low-income communities. Limited enrollment.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Permission of the instructor required. Non-Law students interested in the clinic should send a CV and one-page statement of interest to marianne.engleman-lado@yale.edu.</p>",
