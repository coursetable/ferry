    "description": "During the second half of the long nineteenth century, Russia experienced an unprecedented flourishing of the arts, evolving rapidly from a country with a relatively young literary tradition and few cultural institutions to one that witnessed the likes of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, the Mighty Five, the Peredvizhniki, and the Ballets Russes. Imperial Russian culture, and especially from the era of reform to the revolution (1855\u20131917), has served as the foundation for a national canon and a global artistic reputation, its legacy felt in the Russian avant-garde and official Soviet culture alike, and even in the recent recasting of a twenty-first-century national identity. This seminar considers Russian literature, visual arts, music, and drama in their social, historical, and political contexts, and also across a broad historical scope and alongside criticism with a range of disciplinary perspectives. Russia's conflicted position between East and West, as both part of and apart from Western culture, motivates a number of the course's driving questions. How does Russia's particular experience of modernity impact cultural forms and institutions, and what distinguishes Russia's national manifestations of realism, modernism, and symbolism? How do the arts balance a commitment to pan-European culture with the often self-conscious project of developing a robust national tradition? How is Russian culture introduced to the West, and to what end? How do the various arts experience the transition from the <i>fin de si\u00e8cle</i> to the Soviet period, and how is this transition represented in Soviet and Western historiography? What constitutes the legacy of &quot;the Russians&quot; in the twentieth century and today? Special attention is also given to questions of aesthetics, form, and genre, as well as to the uneven development and different roles of literature, long considered the dominant art in Russia, and the nonverbal arts. The course concludes with a study trip to Russia after the end of the term. Enrollment limited.\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites: HSAR 221a/RUSS 220a and permission of the instructors.</p>",
