    "description": "We arguably live in the age of \u201calternative facts\u201d and \u201cpost-truths\u201d\u2014or, as philosopher Harry Frankfurt presciently theorized it, \u201cbullshit.\u201d By contrast, this course aims to explore the new and burgeoning field of \u201cpolitical epistemology,\u201d for which the concepts of knowledge and even truth\u2014both factual and moral\u2014are central to politics. Political epistemology can be described as a branch of philosophy inquiring into how to acquire knowledge and into what we ought to believe in the political realm. It deals with the ways societies generate, process, and diffuse knowledge and beliefs. Typical questions in political epistemology relate to whether we can know anything in politics and to the epistemic status of political beliefs in general. Between the Charybdis of moral relativism and the Scylla of authoritarian dogmatism, is there any room for something like \u201cpolitical truths\u201d? How would we best attain them and how would we know that we have? Political epistemologists are also concerned with the question of \u201cpeer-disagreement\u201d and the proper epistemic stance to hold with respect to peers, typically other citizens, with whom we disagree. In this course we thus seek to understand better the ways in which political institutions and procedures (somewhat broadly construed, such as national assemblies, electoral rules, parties, the media, courts, etc., but including also social norms) generate and process knowledge. We also study the ways in which certain social, economic, and political arrangements may generate what has been diagnosed as \u201cepistemic injustice\u201d and how this specific type of injustice may be redressed and should be dealt with by both political theorists and political actors.",
