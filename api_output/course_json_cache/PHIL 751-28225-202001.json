    "description": "<p>Hume wrote that \u201cthere are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more obscure and uncertain, than those of <em>power</em>, <em>force</em>, <em>energy</em> or <em>necessary connexion</em>.\u201d This is a very discouraging observation, if true, because as Hume also observed, in metaphysics it is \u201cevery moment necessary\u201d to treat of them. This seminar examines how causation (and the closely related notions of natural law, nature, explanation, intelligibility, and miracle) figure in the thinking of several early modern philosophers, chosen from among Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Shepherd. Each week we look closely at a range of primary texts, usually with the guidance of some recent secondary literature, chosen to exhibit a variety of approaches to the primary material. Although we are seeking to understand each of the philosophers on their own terms, we expect to be thinking as well about the relationships among them. Each was closely attentive to at least some who came before: Malebranche and Spinoza responded to Descartes; Leibniz to Descartes and Malebranche; Berkeley and Hume to Malebranche; and Shepherd to Berkeley and Hume. We also examine more general questions. Was there, for example, a gradual but remorseless shift from a \u201cdemanding\u201d conception of causation, according to which genuine causes should render their effects intelligible, to a more relaxed and distinctively modern conception, according to which a causal explanation need do no more than fit events into familiar patterns\u2014patterns that the mind may find utterly opaque, however familiar experience has made them? If so, was this a good thing or a bad thing: a clarifying advance or an unfortunate loss? Are there good reasons for viewing ordinary causes as mere \u201coccasions,\u201d upon which God exerts a uniquely efficacious will? Can we say that God \u201cconcurs\u201d with the operation of so-called secondary causes without suggesting that those causes have no power of their own? Do bodies and finite minds incorporate \u201cnatures\u201d that are responsible, at least in part, for what they do (or seem to do)? Or are the effects we ascribe to them the work of laws that in some way lie beyond them? What exactly are the \u201claws of nature\u201d? Are they the arbitrary decrees of the author of nature, or inescapable rational necessities? If bodies and minds differ as radically as Descartes (for example) contended, how (if at all) do they interact? Can bodies be the causes of our sensations and ideas? What is an explanation? How do scientific explanations differ from the ones that might be offered in metaphysics? Are miracles best understood as violations of the laws of nature? If so, how are they possible? The seminar begins with a brief study of Francisco Su\u00e1rez\u2019s early modern reworking of the Aristotelian or Thomistic theory of causation\u2014a theory that our philosophers thought they had surpassed.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: prior study of the history of philosophy.</p>",
