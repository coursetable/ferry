    "description": "Technology Law and Policy: Fieldwork (21427). 2 units, credit/fail or graded at student option. This course must be taken in conjunction with the clinic seminar. Approximately one-third of the students in the clinic will work with the teachers of the clinic and the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy &amp; Technology Project on issues or cases currently on the Project\u2019s docket. Representative matters include:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Challenging suspicionless searches of laptops at the international border. The ACLU has been involved in two lawsuits, House v. Napolitano and Abidor v. Napolitano, arguing that the government\u2019s policy of conducting purely suspicionless searches and seizures of laptops and other electronic devices of travelers at the international border violates both the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.<br/>\n\u2022 Filing public records lawsuits to inform the public about government surveillance programs. For example, the ACLU has litigated Freedom of Information Act requests to force the disclosure of records regarding the warrantless tracking of the location of people\u2019s cell phones.<br/>\n\u2022 Challenging unconstitutional Internet filtering. The ACLU has been involved in a challenge to a library system\u2019s refusal to disable its Internet filters to allow adults patrons to engage in uncensored sessions of reading and research, and has also challenged public high school filtering policies that block access to pro-gay speech while allowing access to websites that condemn homosexuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other two-thirds will work with Prof. Schultz in representing clients on additional public interest issues primarily focused on intellectual property topics. Past representative matters include:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Filing briefs in important copyright cases such as Viacom v. YouTube (arguing that overzealous enforcement of copyright will censor independent and experimental video artists), Authors Guide v. Google (arguing that courts should protect the privacy of online book readers), UMG v. Augusto (arguing in favor of consumers\u2019 rights to resell CDs on eBay), Eldred v. Ashcroft (arguing for First Amendment limits on the term of copyright protection), and Coupons, Inc. v. Stottlemire (arguing that the First Amendment protects posting information online concerning computer security issues).<br/>\n\u2022 Counseling open source software, open science, and DIY makers to develop appropriate licensing mechanisms that allow for creative and scientific advances to remain publicly and globally available for research and educational use.<br/>\n\u2022 Filing patent oppositions on behalf of non-profit and public health groups to stop pharmaceutical companies from artificially inflating the price of life saving HIV drugs in poor countries.<br/>\n\u2022 Filing comments and testifying before the U.S. Copyright Office in favor of exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to allow for non-commercial remixing of DVD content and \u201cjailbreaking\u201d of smart phones, tablets, e-book readers, and videogame consoles in order to facilitate scientific research, competition, and access to amateur \u201chomebrew\u201d computer programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnrollment limited to eight. Permission of the instructor required. J.M. Schultz.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork-only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise:Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance; Prosecution Externship; SFALP (New Haven Corp Counsel section only).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students who are accepted in the clinical seminar will be enrolled in the fieldwork section.<br/>\n<br/>",
