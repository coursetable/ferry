    "description": "<p>The political, economic, and philosophical figure of the \u201cdeath sentence,\u201d although it has archaic roots, continues to haunt the 21st century. \u201cCapital punishment,\u201d often understood as the paradigmatic, final, and ultimate form of sovereign power, forms only the starting point of our inquiry. If it is the case that, as John Locke writes quoting Cicero, salus populi suprema lex esto (the safety of the people should be the supreme law), and if, furthermore, this maxim extends in the name of national security up to and including the point where the lives of certain people and populations are thrown into question, then all instances where the state kills, sanctions killing, or benefits directly or indirectly from the killing of its own citizens must be in question in the course. It may seem strange\u2014modern politics, economics, and philosophy all begin from death sentences. The French revolution depended on bloody executions that were \u201cnecessary\u201d for founding a new polity. The Atlantic slave trade condemned millions of Africans to death, under economic reasoning, for the benefit of world capitalism. Athens killed the philosopher Socrates because he was dangerous to the polis, and philosophy has enshrined this death sentence as its mythical origin and its most modern moment. We investigate the stories and logics these events have in common.\u00a0Why does the state kill its own? Why are death sentences necessary for the current complex of state-nation-capital? Why did \u201cbarbaric\u201d practices not end with enlightenment, the critique of religion, scientific rationalism, modernization, capitalism? Answers to these questions come from texts in political theory, philosophy, history, and the social sciences.</p>",
