    "description": "<p>Students deciding to write one-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON 491, or two-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON 491 and <a href=\"/search/?p=ECON%20492\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ECON 492\"  class=\"notoffered\">492</a>, must choose their topics and advisers by Monday, October 3, <a href=\"/search/?p=ECON%202016\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ECON 2016\"  class=\"notoffered\">2016</a>. One-term senior essays are due at the end of the last week of classes in the fall term. Two-term senior essays are due by 4:30 p.m. on Monday, April 3, 2017. Students writing senior essays who would like to be considered for Distinction in the Major must submit three copies of their essay to the Economics department office by 4:30 p.m. on Monday, April 3, 2017. Advisers are chosen with the assistance of the director of undergraduate studies. The format and character of the departmental senior essay may vary to suit the interest of the student and the demands of the topic, but it is expected that the tools and concepts of economic analysis will be employed and that the essay will contain original research. Paper lengths may vary; the normal expectation is thirty pages. Students may receive up to two credits for the senior essay, though it counts as only one departmental seminar whether one or two terms are taken. Meetings for seniors to discuss the senior essay will be held on Wednesday, August 31, at 4:30 p.m. and Thursday, September 1, at 1:30 p.m. in Room 106, 28 Hillhouse Avenue. Seniors planning to write either a one-term or a two-term senior essay should attend one of these meetings. Details regarding calculation of Distinction will be discussed and senior essay guidelines will be distributed.</p>",
