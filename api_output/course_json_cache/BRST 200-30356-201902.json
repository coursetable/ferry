    "description": "<p>This course will focus on the history of gardens, landscape parks, and the architecture of country houses in Great Britain from 1500 to 1750. During this period Britain experienced significant political, economic, and social change. Absolutist monarchical rule gave way after the English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) and the Glorious Revolution,</p>\n<p>\u00c2\u00a0( 1668 ), to a constitutional monarchy subordinate to parliamentary government controlled in large part by the landed gentry. Centuries-old customs of landowners sharing common ground for grazing rights with local farmers, known as the open-field system, and respecting the boundaries of contiguous small farms gave way with the implementation of the Enclosure Acts, which allowed the landed gentry and landed aristocracy to remove villages, buy out contiguous farms, and annex commons to empark their estates. And the landed aristocracy in their country estates established seats of power which they made manifest in the design, scale, and expense of their gardens and the architecture of their houses.</p>\n<p>After nearly two centuries (1500 to 1700) of adopting Italian, French, and Dutch principles of landscape design in garden design, Britain, emerging in the late seventeenth century as the leading imperial power in Europe, gradually developed its own ideas of what a garden or park could be, how it should be laid out architecturally, and what its relationship to the country house would be. In the process Britain transformed landscape and country house architectural history and established itself as the preeminent force of design in Western Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">No prerequisites</p>",
