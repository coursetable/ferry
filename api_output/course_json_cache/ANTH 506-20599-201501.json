    "description": "This graduate-only seminar investigates &quot;state-society&quot; relations from a range of scholarly perspectives. We consider the diverse processes through which political consciousness may be produced, both in relation to the state and in opposition to it. We approach this question from a range of analytical perspectives, including classical sociological approaches to state formation, recent ethnographic work that seeks to understand the micro-politics of mobilization, and journalistic writing that addresses specific contemporary insurgencies. Over the course of the term, each class member develops his or her own theoretical position in conversation with the group, and applies this systematically to an ethnographic case in a final project. The seminar focuses on exploring anthropological approaches to insurgency, the state, and the production of political consciousness, but graduate students from related fields who wish to engage with these questions are also welcome.",
