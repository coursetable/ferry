    "description": "2 credits. The 2015 Conference of the Parties (COP-21) in Paris was a watershed moment in global efforts to address climate change. Over 180 countries committed to emission reduction goals, and several major economies like China agreed to significantly increase their level of ambition. Now, however, we face the challenge of ensuring that the COP-21 pledges are achieved on schedule and that countries are willing and able to agree to deeper reductions in later years. Maintaining and accelerating this progress is critical to provide any hope that global emissions will decline to the level necessary to limit planetary warming to 2o C, the target affirmed in the Paris agreement. As the world\u2019s second biggest emitter, the U.S. played a critical role in shaping the architecture of the Paris agreement. Seeking to lead by example, the Obama Administration pledged to reduce US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. This represents a significant strengthening of the 17 percent 2020 reduction target which the US adopted at the 2009 Copenhagen COP \u2013 a goal that has not yet been achieved -- and will require a major transition to low-carbon technologies and fuels within the next decade. Failure by the US to meet its Paris commitments would be a blow to future global action on climate and would likely result in a weakening of resolve by China and other major emitters. Yet some have underscored the difficult challenges the US will face in reducing emissions by the magnitude required, the divisive political environment in which reduction efforts will occur, and the paucity of effective policy tools under existing law. Even supporters of bold action on climate recognize that whether the US will meet its goals, and by what path, is uncertain. Much of the Obama Administration\u2019s success on climate policy has been accomplished under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). However, with the Supreme Court stay of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the lynchpin of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce GHG emissions from power plants, the efficacy the CAA as a reduction tool has been called into question. Moreover, even if the CPP is ultimately affirmed by the Supreme Court, the reach and effectiveness of the CAA in other areas of the economy remain uncertain. A new US president committed to meeting the Paris goals will need to take decisive and comprehensive action early in his or her Administration. This will require a deep understanding of the potential benefits and limits of existing authorities implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE) and other federal agencies; the speed, cost and feasibility of scaling up new energy sources and technologies across the economy; the contributions of motivated states to reducing the national emission profile; the role of tax and other incentives in stimulating greater low-carbon investments; and whether federal legislation to authorize a carbon tax, cap and trade program or some other policy innovation is possible or necessary",
