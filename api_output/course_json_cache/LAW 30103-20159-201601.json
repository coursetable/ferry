    "description": "*\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0Community and Economic Development Clinic (30103) and Fieldwork (30131). 2 units, credit/fail or graded at student option, for each section (4 units total). Students must be enrolled in the seminar and fieldwork sections simultaneously. CED explores the role of lawyers and the law in building wealth and opportunity in low-income communities. The clinic focuses on issues of neighborhood revitalization, social entrepreneurship, sustainable development and financial inclusion as they relate to community and economic development. Students in CED represent and partner with community organizations, nonprofits, community development financial institutions, neighborhood associations, and small foundations. These client organizations share an interest in promoting economic opportunity and socioeconomic mobility among low- and moderate-income people.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents will represent clients in a range of legal matters including formation and governance of for-profit, not-for-profit and hybrid entities, negotiating and drafting contracts, developing employment and other policies, structuring real estate transactions, resolving zoning and environmental issues, providing tax advice, drafting and advocating for legislation and appearing before administrative agencies. CED engages students in local work which can then be used to inform policy development at the local, state and federal levels. Students will gain skills in client contact, contract drafting, transactional lawyering, legal research and writing, regulatory and legislative advocacy, administrative agency contact and negotiation. The class seminar will meet once a week for two hours and once a week for one hour and will cover federal, state and local policies affecting urban and suburban places; substantive law in tax, real estate development, and corporate governance; and transactional and regulatory lawyering skills, such as negotiating and drafting contracts. Each student will meet with faculty once a week for fieldwork supervision. The clinic is open to students from the Schools of Law, Management, Divinity, Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies, Public Health, and Architecture with prior approval from a faculty member.
