    "description": "To many commentators, conflict seems endemic in the Middle East and North Africa. Since 1945 an enormous amount of international and regional diplomatic effort\u2014and blood and treasure\u2014has been expended on prevention, resolution, state building, and the establishment of mechanisms for collective security and the peaceful conduct of interstate relations. The returns have been poor. Non-state actors have become a complicating factor, acting transnationally in the region\u2019s many current wars and seeking through often covert activities to compromise stability more widely: this issue too has become the subject of much international regulatory, military, intelligence, and diplomatic activity. How can we identify patterns in these conflicts\u2014and international and regional efforts to resolve them\u2014that might enable us to diagnose and address the underlying causes more effectively and shape the application of international soft and hard power more sensibly? How far is the problem of conflict resolution as a matter for the region itself or for an international community perhaps more fractured now than at any time since the Cold War? Do we collectively make things better or worse? And what does the future hold? Students gain a deeper understanding of conflict and diplomacy in the modern MENA region and a framework for creative thinking about the future of both at a time when conflict is greater, the risks higher, and diplomatic engagement more needed yet problematic than it has been for decades.",
