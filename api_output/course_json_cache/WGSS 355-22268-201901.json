    "description": "<p>Will technology lift all boats? Can it help address global inequalities and solve social and environmental problems? From solar power in Puerto Rico, to biometric ID cards believed to efficiently deliver welfare, to new cookstoves in India that promise to help women, how is technology imagined to furthering the project of \u2018development\u2019 that is often seen as synonymous with progress and economic growth? This course surveys a wide range of perspectives, histories, and dilemmas with the goal of understanding how to think of \u2018development\u2019 and \u2018technology for development\u2019 as subjects of study. We examine the gendered targets of development projects, as well as those who create and imagine these projects. We are especially interested in examining relations between development and economy, development and politics, development and technology. In addition to examining gender (often understood to mean just women) as a key aspect of development, this course uses a critical feminist lens to explore a range of issues, including discourses and practices of development within struggles over power, history and culture, the relation between development projects of today in relation to colonial projects and ideologies of \u2018improvement\u2019 and \u2018the civilizing mission\u2019 that were built on particularly racialized, sexualized, and gendered ideas.\u00a0We also consider how the issue of gender and development has changed over time to include questions of gay rights, disability, and protections for children. In this way, we explore how \u2018macro\u2019 agendas have shaped the lives of millions of men and women living across the globe.</p>",
