    "description": "*\u2020Transnational Development Clinic (21650). 3 units, credit/fail, with a graded option. Students who enroll in the spring semester will have the option to continue the fieldwork component in the fall semester. Enrollment limited. Permission of instructor required. M.I. Ahmad.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents in the Transnational Development Clinic work on a range of litigation and non-litigation projects designed to explore the sites for productive intervention of U.S.-based lawyers in development work. With a focus on global poverty, students in the Clinic will identify models of what could be termed &quot;development lawyering.&quot; The Clinic takes a critical perspective on development, interrogating its troubled histories, ideologies, and institutions, and considering shifts in development theory and practice away from an exclusive focus on economic growth and toward equitable distribution of growth, accountable and effective institutions, and capacities-based approaches and understandings. Rather than work with traditional international development institutions, such as the World Bank or U.N. bodies, the Clinic partners with community-based clients, membership-based organizations, and non-governmental organizations and provides them with legal advice, counseling, and representation in order to promote models of inclusive development. With these collaborative partners, the Clinic uses a range of domestic and international mechanisms to either affirmatively promote inclusive development projects or to mount resistance to traditional, institutional approaches to development. The projects are transnational in that they involve mechanisms, strategies, and partnerships both situated in the U.S. and spanning national boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nA seminar accompanying the fieldwork in the provides readings and structured discussion to explore the relationships among law, development and advocacy. In addition, the seminar examines practice-based advocacy skills, including brief writing, oral advocacy, and policy advocacy, and considers professional responsibility as applied to transnational development practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork-only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance; Prosecution Externship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Selection:</i> In addition to listing this course among experiential permission selections, students should also submit a statement of interest and a CV by December 10 at 4:30 p.m. Listing this course among experiential permission selections constitutes authorization for the Registrar's Office to release a copy of the student's YLS transcript to the instructor.<br/>\n<br/>",
