    "description": "<p>The study of late antiquity has, from its very inception, been preoccupied with bodies, injecting questions about physicality and materiality into fields previously preoccupied predominantly with intellectual or spiritual matters. This seminar aims to provide an introduction to the \u201cbodily\u201d considerations that have preoccupied and continue to preoccupy students of late antiquity, including matters of sex, gender, and sexuality; race and ethnicity; health, illness, and death; bodily abjection, including that of slavery or asceticism; etc. In the process, connections emerge between bodily and spiritual <em>topoi:</em> human bodies could, for example, serve as <em>loci</em> of sin or salvation, or become signifiers of religious identity (for better or for worse), while the \u201cspecial\u201d bodies ascribed to angelic and demonic beings, to Jesus and the Virgin Mary, or to humanity in its paradisiacal and eschatological manifestations similarly preoccupied late ancient thinkers. The sources considered in this seminar focus on the period from roughly the second through the sixth century, and range primarily across the Latin, Greek, and Syriac-speaking realms. Most of the primary sources under consideration originate in Christian communities (broadly defined), although engagement with \u201cpagan\u201d and Jewish interlocutors features prominently in both sources and scholarship. In the same vein, this course focuses predominantly on textual matters; students interested in material culture are nevertheless very welcome and warmly encouraged to bring to bear their expertise on both conversations and final projects.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\"><em>EMWAR area of concentration designations: EarXty, LateXty, ScrInterp.</em> The course also provides important historical context for students concentrating in Rabbinic Judaism, Christianity and Judaism in the Hellenistic East, and West Asian Religions of the Sasanian and Early Islamic Eras.</p>",
