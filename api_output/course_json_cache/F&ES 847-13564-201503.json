    "description": "This is a course about the strategies and tactics used in successful environmental campaigns, taught from a practitioner\u2019s perspective. Though this topic is neither well documented nor regularly taught, there is a tactical toolkit that can be learned. Many environmental campaigners learn on the job. For those students interested in pursuing careers in environmental policy making and advocacy, this course is designed to be one that can jumpstart professional development. In a fashion comparable to the case study method offered in business schools, this course examines six cases, all from the past five years, and seeks to discern lessons for best practice. No single environmental campaign is the same, and strategies and tactics are always evolving, but there are several key lessons that can be drawn from such campaigns and there is also value in understanding current best practice even if it is constantly evolving. The six case topics examined in class are the Kyoto Protocol, protecting Alaska\u2019s old growth rainforests, conserving the Pine Barrens Watershed in Eastern Long Island, Home Depot\u2019s decision to preference sustainably managed forest products, the Give Swordfish A Break Campaign, and the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Treaty. Resource people who have played leadership roles in each of these efforts join us for class. The class examines each case, synthesizes lessons learned, and seeks to formulate a practical understanding of key strategies and tactics used to affect positive outcomes.",
