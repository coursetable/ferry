    "description": "3 credits. A Small Network Online Course (SNOC) through the Global Network for Advanced Management (GNAM). The world continues to urbanize. In the one hundred years since 1913, the proportion of the world\u2019s population that lives in cities grew fivefold from 10 to 50 percent, and estimates suggest that 75 percent of the world\u2019s population will do so in 2050. Though history reveals that urbanization has always been an accelerator of growth and development, it also poses profound challenges for residents, communities, corporations, cities, regions, and countries. <a href=\"/search/?p=A%202015\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:A 2015\"  class=\"notoffered\">A 2015</a> McKinsey report succinctly notes: \u201cCities are where most of the world\u2019s population live, work, and play, and they are important to everyone else, too. They are the world\u2019s economic engine, consuming the majority of global power and resources, while generating 80 percent of GDP and 70 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions. Making cities great is the critical infrastructure challenge of this century.\u201d\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">This online course is a collaborative offering to students across the GNAM network schools. It brings together the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) network, the Rockefeller Foundation, schools across the GNAM (with faculty from Yale, as well as the University of British Columbia, EGADE Business School, Ghana Business School, and the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore), and practitioners from business, government, and civil society to engage with the topic of urban resilience. For the purposes of this course, we draw on the view of urban resilience articulated by 100RC as the ability of individuals, communities, businesses, institutions, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and thrive in response to the acute shocks and chronic stresses they may experience. The purposes of the course are to help students: (1) articulate resilience challenges and opportunities facing global cities; (2) describe the holistic and integrated nature of resiliency and its key drivers; and (3) work in virtual global teams to design collaborative approaches to addressing urban resilience challenges involving business, government, and civil society.</p>",
