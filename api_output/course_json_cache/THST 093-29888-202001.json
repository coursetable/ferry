    "description": "<p>Within theater, there is always an initial spark of creation, whether it initiates from the playwright, a group of improvisers, or a combination of playwright and a troupe of actors. This course focuses on how to investigate, analyze, replicate and catalyze that impulse.\u00a0It sources many art forms as a window into how we create, and attempts to address how artists begin to move from idea to execution. What is creativity? Is it innate? Is it a skill that can be developed? How? What happens when two or more people are involved in that pursuit of creation? Which techniques are common across disciplines? And how might a theater artist learn about creative pursuits from artists in other disciplines including music, design, and fiction as well as theater? Students from all backgrounds and interests will delve into techniques, identifying and integrating\u00a0habits that foster creativity, creating their own works over the semester, both in small and larger groups, in solo and group projects.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Enrollment limited to first year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.\u00a0</p>",
