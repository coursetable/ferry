    "description": "The course focuses on the new theorizations of what is called &quot;mobility theory,&quot; which has been a strong area of research in studies of culture and globalization. This is not a course on technology but on cultures of technologies of mobility, as well as on ideas of movement, displacement, and travel. From understanding &quot;mobile subjects&quot; to addressing the agency of technologies of mobility within transnational networks, the course brings together a broad area of research that looks at the ways in which modernity has included conceptualizations of movement and speed and subjects have seen themselves as modern through notions of mobility and movement. We investigate these mobile modernities to understand what is seen as outside such modernity, or what are seen as problems of modernity (such as refugee movements). In doing so, the course brings an interdisciplinary feminist cultural analysis to theories of multiple and different mobilities.",
