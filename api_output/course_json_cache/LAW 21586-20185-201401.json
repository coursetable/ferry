    "description": "Law and the American Health Care System (21586). 3 units. What is &quot;health law&quot;? This course will use the field's most important books, articles, statutes, and cases to get to the bottom of that question. Beginning with the study of the field's overarching normative debates (what should the role of a health care system be?), we will move through topics ranging from Medicaid, to bioethics, to drug research, to the role of insurance, to get the &quot;big picture&quot; view of the field, the stakes and the role that legal theory scholarship and doctrine can and do play. Our focus will be both doctrinal -- what are the major principles and doctrines of health law? -- and normative -- what role should law play in this critical area of our national economy and welfare? Along the way, we will welcome guest speakers from legal and medical practice to share the &quot;on the ground&quot; view. Students will write a research paper on the health-related topic of their choice, and be responsible for a brief presentation of their work to the rest of the class. Substantial Paper or Supervised Analytic Writing credit may be available with the permission of the instructor. Students from the Schools of Management, Medicine, and Public Health are also welcome. Paper required. Enrollment limited to twenty. Permission of the instructor required. A. Gluck.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse Bidding: In addition to listing this course among permission-of-the-instructor selections, students should submit a one-paragraph statement of interest, which should include a list of any previous health law courses or health policy related experience, to the Registrar\u2019s Office or to registrar.law@yale.edu by 4:30 pm on December 11.
