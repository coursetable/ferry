    "description": "4 credits. NP. Group B. Central to the mission of the Yale School of Music and the activities of its students is engagement with the classical canon, a closely interrelated body of prestigious musical works spanning several centuries of Western European history, from the eighteenth century through the twentieth. Within the academy and among devotees of classical music, the canon is often treated as transcendently valuable, essentially closed, and increasingly under threat\u2014a fixed tradition to be defended against the forces of change. This class invites students to devise alternative approaches to the canon by exploring the implications of difference, both in and around the works they have already heard and played. Difference in race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, national and political affiliation, disability, and educational access: despite the canon\u2019s well-deserved reputation for cultural homogeneity, all these types of difference have found eloquent expression in the standard repertoire and in the compositional practices of long-famous composers. This class attunes our ears and music-analytic approaches to the implications of difference in works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Dvor\u00e1k, Puccini, Ives, Stravinsky, and others at the heart of the classical canon, providing new insights into music we thought we knew. At the same time, we also venture outside the confines of the canon as it is typically construed. Across three centuries, we explore music written by women, people of color, and others traditionally excluded from the canon, from female Europeans to enslaved Africans and their descendants in America; and we investigate historical perspectives that complement the canon\u2019s traditional emphasis on the compositional act by examining the accounts of performers, patrons, suffragists, novelists, and poets. Along the way, we are guided by concise readings in recent musicological scholarship as well as race theory, feminist theory, queer theory, disability studies, communication theory, and other disciplines. The goal of the course is neither to defend the canon nor to debunk it, but rather to reimagine its boundaries and reassess its implications for the musicians who will carry it forward. Repertoire and directions of study are chosen in significant part according to students\u2019 interests and current performance or compositional projects. Class sessions are discussion-driven, and open, respectful dialogue is encouraged. Course requirements include daily listening and score study, brief readings from both historical and scholarly sources, three brief response papers (1\u20134 pages), occasional oral presentations (3\u20135 minutes), and a final oral examination on topics selected by the student.",
