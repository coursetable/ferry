    "description": "<p>Aging individuals throughout the world suffer debilitating mental incapacities collectively known as dementia. Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease (AD), the most prevalent form, was first described more than one hundred years ago and remains an enigma despite several decades of intensive scientific research. AD is now the costliest chronic disease in the United States and will bankrupt the health care system if solutions are not discovered. This course explores what we know about its causes, its complications, and the rationale behind the treatments that are now available. Toxic protein deposits predicted by the amyloid hypothesis are widely regarded as primary causes, but our inability to design effective anti-amyloid treatments has turned our attention to many other contributing pathogenic factors, including blood vessel damage and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of dementia is declining, testimony to the idea that effective preventive measures could rescue large numbers of vulnerable people. The course explores in depth what these might be. It focuses on the analysis of primary research data and is geared to the interests of students planning a career in brain-related research in academics or industry. Two-hour weekly sessions involve student presentations of critical publications, followed by discussion. Topics covered include amyloid hypothesis; toxic mutations; animal models; immune therapy; ApoE4; small blood vessel damage; inflammation; memory; brain training; protective lifestyles; false alarms and uncertain claims; and economics of dementia.</p>\n<p class=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisite: students interested in this course should e-mail a brief description of their background and future goals to vincent.marchesi@yale.edu.
