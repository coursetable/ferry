    "description": "Feminist Theory and the Law: Seminar (21437). 2 units. This seminar will critically examine some major intellectual traditions in second-wave American feminist theory and explore their relevance to the law. Radical feminism identifies sexuality as the crucible of gender inequality, for example, while cultural feminism points to mothering and kinship. Socialist feminists are concerned with the gender-based distribution of labor, and liberal feminists worry about gender-based exclusion from &quot;public&quot; spheres more broadly. Feminists of color challenge the validity of isolating gender from other categories of social existence, while feminist post-structuralists question the existence of the stable identity categories upon which some other approaches depend. Each of these traditions has found expression in legal scholarship, with authors championing distinctive (though sometimes overlapping) approaches to various areas of law. The class will examine one or more current debates within feminist legal theory to consider how the various traditions have influenced, and might still influence, the debate and the relevant law.
