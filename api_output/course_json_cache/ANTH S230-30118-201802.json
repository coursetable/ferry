    "description": "Offered in Singapore. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. This course provides a broad introductory overview of contemporary Southeast Asia, surveying the region\u2019s extraordinary diversity and ongoing sociocultural, economic, and political transformations. Focusing on the nation-states that have emerged following the second World War, the module offers an historical and anthropological perspective on the ways Southeast Asian societies have changed over time in response to the pressures of colonialism, nationalism and globalization. Students will remain particularly attentive to the ways these issues shape the everyday lives and identities of Southeast Asians. This course features a 7 to 9-day field trip to various religious and cultural sites in Indonesia. Participants study a second module along with Southeast Asia in Context. Stuents choose either, \u201cMS2210: Malay Culture and Society&quot; or \u201cSE2218: Changing Economic Landscape of Southeast Asia.&quot; All three modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. <b>Application Deadline: February 15</b>. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Singapore and any other expenses beyond tuition. Enrollment limited to Yale and other IARU partner students.For further details visit the <a href=\"https://studyabroad.yale.edu/programs/yale-summer-session-singapore-southeast\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">program page</span></a> on the Study Abroad website.
