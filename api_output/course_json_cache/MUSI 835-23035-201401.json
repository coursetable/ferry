    "description": "Diversity is desired in most biological evolutionary contexts but eschewed in many canon-based music cultures. This course begins by asking whether ideas about the diversity of species in various locations and evolutionary trends can be usefully compared to the diversity of music cultures in particular locations. Do similar kinds of cultures develop parallel relationships to their music cultures (do cultural homologies exist)? What are the ramifications\u2014local and global\u2014of the extinction of species/music cultures? What are the effects and results of various attempts to preserve/sustain particular species and music cultures? What are the ethics and aesthetics of promoting preservation and sustainability of musical and biological species? What is the role of ecocriticism in the sustenance of music cultures? Are these the right questions to ask about these issues? Musical materials, cultures, and topics may include Kaluli aesthetics; the landmark Mabo case and Aboriginal Australian music cultures; the effects of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designations (Chinese kunqu and Javanese wayang as case studies); the potential and problems of (as well as some reasons behind) canon formation; an exploration of whether the heterogeneity associated with globalization is like biological diversity. This course is decidedly exploratory since the course materials draw on ideas, concepts, and case studies from several generally nonrelated disciplines.",
