    "description": "Juvenile Justice Clinic (30133) and Fieldwork (30134). 2 units, credit/fail, with a graded option, for each part (4 units total). The clinic and fieldwork must be taken simultaneously. Students represent children and youth in juvenile cases in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters courthouse on Whalley Avenue in New Haven. Students handle all aspects of their clients' cases under the direct supervision of clinical faculty. Students learn how to build relationships with clients and their families, investigate and develop their cases, construct persuasive case theories, negotiate with opposing counsel, prepare motions and briefs, and advocate for youth in court. Students also explore the legal framework governing the representation of youth in juvenile delinquency cases, including the rules of professional responsibility. Throughout, students are encouraged to think critically about the operation of the juvenile justice system and to reflect on opportunities for reform. Class will meet weekly with occasional supplemental sessions to be arranged. Additionally, students will attend weekly case supervision sessions. Because of the frequency of court appearances, students must keep two days each week (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, 9 a.m\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 p.m. and 2 - 4 p.m.) free from other obligations. Open only to JD students. Enrollment limited. Permission of the instructor required. T.R. Birckhead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> New students who are accepted into this clinic must attend a one-day intensive session to prepare for their first client meetings and court appearances. For the Spring 2017 clinic, this all-day session will be held on Friday, January 13 from 9:30 a.m. until 5 p.m. Attendance is required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Course Bidding:</i> In addition to listing this clinic among experiential course selections, interested students must submit a statement of interest, a CV, and a signed statement of understanding the commitment to continued case work until graduation by the close of the bidding period on December 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Due to our immediate commitments to our clients, Professor Birckhead will finalize the roster by email before the first class, after which the clinic cannot be dropped. Because classes prepare students for client work, attendance at all classes is mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note:</b> Students may not be enrolled in an LSO clinic and any of the following non-LSO clinics in the same semester, whether as a student director, fieldwork only returning student, continuing student, or otherwise: Education Adequacy Project; Legal Assistance: Prosecution Externship.<br/>\n<br/>",
