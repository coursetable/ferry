    "description": "Research Methods in Regulatory and Administrative Law (21493). 1 unit, credit/fail. This course will examine federal, state, and local sources of administrative law and will teach students to research agency regulations, agency cases, and other sources of administrative law, using a variety of print and online sources. The goal of the course is to give students an understanding of the sophisticated research skills required for finding administrative authority in its various forms, including: enabling statutes, proposed and final agency regulations, decisions, opinions and policy, and executive orders. Topics covered include federal and state legislative and administrative history, increasing efficiency through the use of secondary sources, research in specialized fields, and the use of a variety of legal and non-legal online resources, such as agency websites. Emphasis will be on researching using free, government resources, but students will also learn how to conduct regulatory research using Lexis and Westlaw, and other databases. Although the primary focus of this course will be on researching federal administrative law, one class session will be devoted to researching state and local administrative law. Students will be evaluated based on class participation and on a final research project focused on a regulatory issue and agency of their choosing. The skills requirement (\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0) may be satisfied by taking this course with another 1-unit legal research course. This course will meet in the first half of the terjm. S. B. Kauffman, J. Graves-Krishnaswami, and M. VanderHeijden.",
