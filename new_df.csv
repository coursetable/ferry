38,202401,1,Black Modernisms,"Artists and Thinkers thus created their articulations and complications of Modernity. Because the discourse on ways Western Modernism was influenced by African Art is well-established; the main focus of this lecture course lies on the ways Black Artists and Thinkers participated in cultural, formal, and creative innovations. This demands a transdisciplinary approach that is informed by theoretical tools provided by Black Studies and Queer of Color Feminisms as well as a constant reading of texts and artworks against their grain. Particularly in example when we look at the close entanglement of early 20th-century Black Aesthetics and the History of Primitivism. We look with a trans-chronological lens at paintings, sculptures, photography as well as film/installation to explore the aesthetics and queries that Black Modernisms pose to us today and retroactively to their histories.",,LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259,MW 11:35am-12:50pm,"{""Monday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]],""Wednesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95670/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,"Monday, May 6, 2024 at 2pm",False,False,False,,4.0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,7,7,,,,

Food serves as a useful entry point to interdisciplinary American and Ethnic Studies because centering food requires that we think across history, cultural studies, anthropology, science, ecology, aesthetics, embodiment, and more. Through food studies we gain a unique understanding of the peoples, cultures, plants, animals, mobilities, and flavors that shape societies, communities, and individuals. With a focus on Caribbean, Black, Latinx, and indigenous perspectives, we use critical food studies to examine questions about place, history, racial formations, migration, and above all, different approaches to writing, drafting, editing, and re-writing.",,WLH 001 - William L.

We look closely at some of the main musical genres that originated in Africa during the colonial period, as well as those that have emerged in Portugal in recent times within African and Afro-Portuguese communities, such as Kuduro Progressivo, Kizomba, and Rap Kriolu, drawing comparisons with African American and other diasporic African popular music.

44,202401,1,Black Sound & the Archive: the Musician as Historian,"This course begins with the recognition that Black sonic expression is perhaps the most potent and longstanding historical archive devised by African Americans across the stretch of captivity in the Americas and into the realm of modern life. It takes seriously the concept of sound and musical performance as forms of recourse for the dispossessed, those who were, in the time of slavery, historically denied access to literacy, and, in the time of emancipation, denied the ability to freely and widely build edifices of institutional power that might preserve and sustain African American cultural memory. In the face of such seemingly insurmountable circumstances and conditions, Black musicians have consistently excavated the past of a people, reframing lost and overlooked lives and narratives that widen and deepen our engagement with history. This class examines the work of a diverse array of historical and literary texts in relation to the repertoires of contemporary musicians whose intellectual radicalism enlivens our modern culture. This semester’s iteration of Black Sound & the Archive will pay specific attention to the Black feminist critical tradition in literature and music across the centuries. The first half of the class will lay the foundations of the Black feminist literary tradition, and the second half will showcase modern day musicians who are engaging with pioneering 19th and 20thcentury Black feminist writers and artists.",,WALL81 201 - 81 Wall Street 201,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""WALL81 201 - 81 Wall Street 201"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559926""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95902/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,0.5,4.291666666666666,4.5,1,4.0,1,4.5,1,4.0,1,,13,13,,,,

47,202401,1,Jazz and African-American Historical Representations in American Films,"This course deals with the presence of jazz music in American cinema, mainly in Hollywood films. Beyond considering the role of major jazzmen and jazzwomen in films such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Benny Goodman, Thelonious Monks, Lena Horne, etc., we also analyze how jazz and African Americans are represented in Hollywood films featuring this music as a focal point or as musical accompaniment. Jazz music has served historically as a medium for early African-American presence in Hollywood films, via musical numbers and performances (Duke Ellington orchestra, the Nicholas Brothers, etc.), all while conforming to the demands of major film companies. During WWII, wartime films saw in jazz the opportunity to convey consent and support for the war (Birth of the Blues, Blues in the Night, Syncopation). By exploring films from the 1930s to the 1970s, and cross-examining essays by Paul Gilroy, Krin Gabbard, and others, this course calls into question these attempts and investigates the early silencing, instrumentalization, and reappropriation processes commonly characteristics of Hollywood. We contextualize this filmography by comparing it with films made by African-American film directors and analyzing their use of jazz music. The course illustrates how jazz music embodies a formal and political counter-power, evident through its themes and compositions, and demonstrates how films such as The Cry of Jazz, or The Connection capture this spirit.",,WLH 204 - William L.

There is no better site to look at in the History of Art than Exhibitions. Those sites of public display are particularly charged when it comes to Black Artists. Not only is Black Exhibition Histories an emerging field in the field of Exhibition Histories itself it is also a missing piece in understanding the complexities of Black Art. This seminar explores how Black Artists have been exhibited, organized exhibitions, and created their own spaces as well as the ways in which the discourses around Blackness have shifted over time in tandem with the ways in which Black Artists works have been framed. When we look at the history of Black exhibitions, we look at more than just the intricacies of artistic display and inclusion or exclusion. The reason why Black art exhibitions are a tremendously rich resource to understand artistic movements, political shifts and aesthetic developments is that Black exhibitions tell cultural histories and allow for revelatory debates to emerge about our current moment and potentially moments to come.",,LORIA 258 - Loria Center 258,Th 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Thursday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""LORIA 258 - Loria Center 258"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95661/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.1428571428571428,4.0,4.0,1,2.857142857142857,1,4.0,1,2.857142857142857,1,,19,19,,,,

But, we also look closely at the richness of love and intimacy, the radical roots of self-fashioning, and the insurgent potentiality of mobility and aesthetic creativity coursing through the lives of her protagonists who cut a fugitive path out of slavery, ride the waves of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, Civil Rights era hope and organizing, and post-Soul searching.

68,202401,1,The Native American Renaissance,"In 1983, Kenneth Lincoln described the flowering of Native literatures in the years after N. Scott Momaday's publication of House Made of Dawn (1968) as the ""Native American Renaissance."" This course goes through many of the most important literary works in the decades after 1968 and studies their themes in relation to other salient qualities of Native life. Namely, we examine those works' investments in ecology, sovereignty, and politics (especially the Red Power movement). We explore how this period led to a revitalization of traditional storytelling and the emergence of new forms of expression that reflected the changing realities of Native American life. Readings may include works by Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, Joy Harjo, Louise Erdrich, Simon Ortiz, Gerald Vizenor, and Vine Deloria. We also evaluate how Native literature transformed from this literary period into more recent works by Native creators like Tanya Tagaq, Tommy Orange, Sterlin Harjo, Cherie Dimaline, and Deborah Miranda.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

69,202401,1,Foreign in a Domestic Sense: Latinx Literature Aside the Law,"How has Latinx identity emerged through and against the law? From the suspension of Puerto Rican sovereignty to the contemporary proliferation of ethnic studies bans, the state has used the law to delimit Latinx to transparent or static categories of irregular ""citizen,"" ""refugee,"" and ""migrant.""  If conventional thinking assumes that art only responds to the law in protest or affirmation of the status quo, this seminar introduces students to the ways Latinx literature engages, resists, and disidentifies with the law as it delineates national belonging. We ask how do Latinx creative expressions expand the notions of citizenship, nation, and family beyond their raced, classed, and gendered origins to imagine new futures. Through attention to contemporary tv, film, novels, and poetry, we examine how Latinx artists build alternative forms of thriving collective life in forms of mutual aid, queer kinship, party, and protest. Works up for discussion include those by Justin Torres, Raquel Salas Rivera, and the television show Vida. Drawing inspiration from these texts, students collaborate on podcasts, write analytical essays, and complete other critical and creative projects.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

70,202401,1,The Road in Literature and Film,"Stories about journeys are at the heart of some of the most powerful works of art and literature that humankind has produced, from the time of Homer’s Odyssey onward, and the trope of the journey has played an especially prominent role in American literature and film. In this course, we look at modern and contemporary examples of books and films that explore ""the road"" both as a path to freedom and discovery and as a site of hardship and precarity. Along the way, we examine quests for personal enlightenment, flights from economic and political oppression, and attempts to locate some ""elsewhere"" that’s more exciting than home. Works of literature are likely to include Walt Whitman’s ""Song of the Open Road,"" Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, Muriel Rukeyser’s U.S. 1, Jesmyn Ward’s Sing, Unburied, Sing, and Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad.

How does disability impact well-being? What are the implications of clinical efforts to prevent or reduce disability, such as through gene-editing and abortion? How do the social justice issues attending disability interact with the ideologies of anthropocentrism, white supremacy, homophobia, and sexism?

88,202401,1,"Information, Ethics, and Society","Information Science is a multidisciplinary field that examines information systems in a broad array of social contexts, encompassing historical, cultural, economic, legal, and political perspectives. This introductory seminar provides in-depth study of contemporary information technologies, emphasizing their relationship with power dynamics and ethical considerations.

107,202401,1,Bob Dylan,"An intensive exploration of the music of Bob Dylan as life philosophy and great art. Through close attention to his major songs and albums, we track him across his sixty-year odyssey of self-fashioning, from folk revivalist to protest singer, rock ‘n’ roll surrealist to country crooner, loving husband to lovesick drifter, secular Jew to born-again Christian to worldly skeptic, honest outlaw to Nobel Prize-winning chronicler of modern times and philosopher of song. We also study Dylan’s borrowings from key musical and literary influences (Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, Robert Johnson, Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music, Arthur Rimbaud, T. S. Eliot, Allen Ginsberg) to understand the relation between tradition and the individual talent. Ongoing discussion topics include: the elusiveness of identity and the need for selfhood; virtue and vice; freedom and servitude; reverence and irreverence; love, desire, and betrayal; faith and unbelief; aging, death, and the possibility of immortality; the authentic and the counterfeit; the nature of beauty and artistic genius; the meaning of personal integrity in a political world.",This course is not open to students previously enrolled in HUMS 040.,LC 206 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 206,T 6pm-9pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""18:00"",""21:00"",""LC 206 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 206"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95938/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.485576923076923,4.326704545454545,4.5625,1,3.076923076923077,1,4.5625,1,3.076923076923077,1,,47,47,,,,

This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.",none,WALL81 301 - 81 Wall Street 301,Th 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""WALL81 301 - 81 Wall Street 301"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559926""]]}",[],"[""Hu"",""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93190/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.75,4.708333333333334,4.75,1,3.0,1,4.75,1,3.0,1,,52,52,,,,

163,202401,1,Understanding Human Origins,"This course deals with scientific questions of what we know about human origins and human evolution. It presents evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. It also tackles the issue of how we know what we think we know of our own ancestry over the past 6 million years. In other words, what constitutes evidence for human evolution and how is that evidence interpreted? Students are introduced to basic milestones in human evolution and learn how they have shaped us into the species we are today, using diverse lines of evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. We critically examine key debates that have taken place over the last century of exploration in human evolutionary research, learning how unconventional thinking and spectacular discoveries have shaped current knowledge of our origins. Students meet strange and fascinating historical characters, and then meet our fossil ancestors via the cast collection. Students also receive hands-on and interactive learning about the morphology, life history patterns, locomotion, social behavior, and diet of our nearest fossil relatives; observe living primates to assess what they can tell us about our own deep past; dive into data collection by locating real archaeological and fossil sites; and learn how molecular techniques such as ancient DNA have transformed understanding of the origins of our own species. By formally debating controversial issues with classmates, students learn what a surprising amount of information scientists can discern from fragmentary fossils, and are brought up to date with the most current discoveries in human evolution.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

Is it in your cells, memories, past experiences, and past generations? And if your body can hold trauma in all these ways, what does healing look like? What kinds of somatic-or body focused- therapies are emerging to respond to embodied trauma? This course focuses on the topics of trauma, bodies, and healing to explore theoretical and methodological approaches to studying bodies across medicine, media, science, and society. First, we draw on anthropological and feminist orientations that ground conceptual approaches to understanding the body within social theory. We focus specifically on how Black, Indigenous, and postcolonial feminist epistemologies narrate the entanglements of bodies across nature-culture and biosocial environments. In addition, we engage with creative nonfiction memoirs that tell stories about bodies, trauma, and healing. Then, we triangulate social theory and creative nonfiction with emergent literature in medicine, science, and public health to critically interrogate biomedical processes of diagnosing, treating, and standardizing trauma and bodies. Finally, we explore a variety of somatic healing approaches aimed at addressing embodied trauma through body work and storytelling.",,WLH 202 - William L.

188,202401,1,"Reparation, Repair, Reconciliation: Reckoning with Slavery and Colonialism in Global Perspective","Imperial reckoning for slavery, imperialism, and colonialism has gained new momentum in recent years, from official apologies for colonial violence to reparations lawsuits filed in Asia, Europe, and the US for slavery, genocide, and massacres, to demands for the return of bodily remains and cultural artifacts from established cultural institutions. This seminar explores how these new attempts for belated imperial reckoning are reshaping relations between former empires and their ex-colonies. It approaches imperial reckoning as a site for redressing not only the original violence but also the transitional injustice incurred in the process of the unmaking of empire, which calls for post-imperial reckoning. Drawing on examples from recent cases, this course explores what it means to belatedly reckon with imperial violence today. What does it mean to reckon with imperial violence through legal means, decades after the dissolution of empires? What is the role of law in belated redress? How is historical responsibility articulated and by whom? Who is responsible for what, then and now? What are the stakes in reckoning with distant, yet still alive, pasts? Why and how does it matter today for those of us who have no direct experience of imperial violence?

190,202401,1,Anthropology of Design,"To design is to devise courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones – Herbert Simon, The Sciences of the Artificial. In its modern usage, the term design implies planning and intentional intervention as well the act of drawing out forms. Design is understood as ""what lifts making from using"" (Gatt and Ingold 2013). Connected with order and improvement, designing is an intentional activity that is seemingly a universal human practice. Designing happens at different scales and in multiple contexts–from the design of functional objects to buildings, cities, infrastructural systems and services, games and software to improvisatory designing that takes place in grey zones and precarious environments involving hacking, pirating, counterfeiting and guerilla tactics of surviving through poverty and lack. In this course, we explore design, conceived broadly as the human capacity of engaging through creation as well as a specialized field of professional activity. We study how design is both ubiquitous and invisible and how acts of design have cultural and political implications for the world we live in and for those that we wish to inhabit collectively through specific ethnographic cases. Alongside, we also explore the influence of design as a field of knowledge and a method for connecting with the world through making upon the discipline of anthropology. ""Anthropology-by-way-of-design"" (Gatt and Ingold 2013) offers a distinct way of understanding the influence of politics on epistemology re-engaging feminist, anticolonial, black and indigenous ways of knowing and intervening in the world through the lens of re-making the world. Our readings weave these approaches to investigate how concepts are formed not just from analyzing the world but from desiring to change it.",This course is suited for juniors and seniors with some design or anthropology studies but prior experience in these fields is not required.,LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358,T 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95897/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.8888888888888888,4.222222222222222,4.222222222222222,1,2.3333333333333335,1,4.222222222222222,1,2.3333333333333335,1,,105,106,,,,

Why is blood so often used in cultural narratives of national belonging, fear and desire, purity and impurity? This cross-divisional seminar explores the complexity of blood from the disciplinary angles of medical anthropology and the humanities. We study how cultural narratives have informed scientific research about blood and how scientific research has influenced cultural beliefs surrounding blood. Blood is a biological substance bearing a host of social meanings. It can keep communities together and tear them apart. The course establishes a transdisciplinary dialogue in order to study the complexity of blood in different cultures.

Indigenous peoples always fare far worse than non-indigenous ones in terms of health status. No matter where one looks, there are substantial health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations in the form of mortality and morbidity gaps. We go over the epidemiological landscape of indigenous populations and discuss causes of death and sickness, which vary from population to population. We then expand on some of the possible interactive causes of these disparities, particularly the role that globalization and market integration is having in shaping the health situation of indigenous peoples. Finally, we discuss the current surge of Global Health Programs, mainly at academic or research institutions in the northern hemisphere and the contribution of anthropology to those programs.",,SA10 105 - 10 Sachem Street 105,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""SA10 105 - 10 Sachem Street 105"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559538""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93322/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,There are no prerequisites for this course. ,No regular final examination,False,False,False,2.053571428571429,4.333333333333334,4.428571428571429,1,2.375,1,4.428571428571429,1,2.375,1,,124,125,,,,

246,202401,1,"Revolutionary Cities:  Protest, Rebellion and Representation in Modern Urban Space","Cities have always been hotbeds of radical ideas and actions. Their cafes and taverns, drawing rooms and universities have been incubators of new ideas, revolutionary ideologies and debate, while their streets and public spaces have been the sites of demonstrations, protests, and uprisings. Since cities are key nodes in larger networks of trade and cultural exchange, these local events have often had a global audience and impact. This seminar explores the interaction of urban space and event, and the media and technologies of revolutionary representation, through case studies of particular cities at transformational moments in their development.

247,202401,1,"Creativity, Innovation, and “The New”","This seminar explores the role of ""The New"" in the design of our world. Through exploring the history of newness as an idea, its current understanding within philosophy, and examining its understanding in multiple creative fields today including art, architecture, product design, social microcultures, cars, food, fashion, and toys, students gain both knowledge about the role of ""The New"" in human society and are exposed to cutting-edge ideas in multiple disciplines. Through the study of emerging creative trends, detailed historic case studies, both philosophical and popular readings, and engaged group discussion we examine the very concept of ""The New"" from all possible angles—what it is, its history, why it is desired, the motivations of those that produce and promote it, who profits from it, and the morality of its continued rehearsal in a world with evolving ethics regarding the use of human labor and natural resources in the production of things. This course encourages students to consider these positions through not only research, presentations and discussion, but also speculative ‘making’ that challenges students to address the subject of ""The New"" themselves—through the very process of design. No particular skills or previous exposure to the design world is required.",,RDH 212 - Rudolph Hall 212,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""RDH 212 - Rudolph Hall 212"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559534""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93179/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,2.5892857142857144,4.875,4.875,1,2.2857142857142856,1,4.875,1,2.2857142857142856,1,,155,159,,,,
248,202401,1,In Ruins: Cultural Dimensions of the Climate Crisis,"How are unpredictable weather events, extreme socio-economic inequality and political instability connected and interpreted in the everyday lives of ordinary citizens across the globe? What forms of collective value and imaginaries of the future are emerging from this moment of planetary-scale danger and crisis? The hope of a progressive future of endless growth and prosperity, promised by technology and modernization is no longer viewed as sustainable for most of the world’s population. Nevertheless, the climate crisis is motivating new forms of collective action grounded in new, cross-cultural understandings of the interconnections between beings and their environments under the sign of climate change. This course explores the role of cultural and historical specificity in perceptions and experiences of climate change across the globe and the challenges of operating in a world of unknown risks, hidden dangers and unprecedented uncertainty. Drawing on works by anthropologists, architects, literary critics, historians as well as fictional accounts, we explore and foreground culturally situated accounts, speaking to the possibilities of life on a ruined planet. These accounts offer students a transdisciplinary history of the present, expanding upon the technical and policy-oriented literature that dominates debates about climate change.",This course gives priority to juniors and seniors.  ,TBA,TBA,{},[],"[""So""]",1.0,,,,CANCELLED,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,156,160,,,,
249,202401,1,"Cultural AI: Machine Vision, Art, and Design","More than any other technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to transform the fields of art and design over the next decade. In addition to its economic impact as it replaces and alters human labor, machine vision and cognition will alter and displace human creativity. Already, AI has added a series of invisible layers–filters and lenses–to how we see and create our environment. Understanding this new machine-mediated visual culture is critical to addressing its growth, finding potentials and opportunities for intervention, and identifying avenues for critique and resistance. Readings and discussion trace the historical role of algorithms in human culture and the understanding of creation and design as an algorithmic–even machinic–process. They chart the shift from the explicit code of software to the black box of machine learning and the birth of what Lev Manovich calls ‘cultural AI’–a filter over our collective imagination as technology is incorporated into image-making, -selection, and -viewing platforms. Students also work with AI platforms such as Runway ML to develop design proposals that take a critical and aesthetically specific stance on the current and impending impact of AI on cultural production.",,LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358,Th 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93183/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.25,4.25,4.25,1,3.0,1,4.25,1,3.0,1,,157,161,,,,

Students assess the influence of Black people in the early modern period and their crucial role in aiding slavery’s abolition in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They also explore race tensions during the First World War, inter-war relationships, and Second World War actions, including racial rioting born out of social reasons, and explore contemporary debates about growing immigration into the country. In particular, the course explores how Black British history does not just begin with the Windrush Generation in 1947, and assesses longer legacies of civil rights, interracial relations, and racial and ethnic relations with other communities (including British Asians). Students consider social and political tensions, Race Relation Acts, rioting, and relationships between Black communities and British policing. There are interdisciplinary elements to this course, as students study art history, contemporary primary source documents, film, and literature alongside political, social, and cultural sources. This course brings together themes of empire, decolonizing curricula, and comparative history of global migration and racial civil rights to bring Black British history to the fore.",,TBA,TBA,{},[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,,,,ACTIVE,,This course is only open to students participating in the Yale in London program.,HTBA,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,249,264,,,,

432,202401,1,The Cognitive Science of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are among the most striking pieces of technology to have been developed in recent memory. The ability of these artificial intelligence models to quickly generate human-like text raises pressing questions for the study of cognition. To wit: are LLMs mere ""stochastic parrots,"" or statistical models that produce human-like text despite not being capable of understanding what they are saying or making reference to objects? Or, are they silicon implementations of the algorithms used by humans for linguistic cognition? Do they falsify the thesis that the grammatical structure of human language is innate? Or, do they provide a new model for human language acquisition? Can they be used to replace human participants in psychological studies? Do they entrench and reproduce harmful biases inherent in our social psychology? Are they, all things considered, a force for good or for ill? This course explores all of these questions and more. Students develop a high-level understanding of how LLMs work, in part by playing around with some relatively simple coding notebooks.","Prerequisite: One course in either Philosophy or Psychology, and one course in either Mathematics or Computer Science. ",LC 211 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 211,MW 1pm-2:15pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""LC 211 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 211"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]],""Wednesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""LC 211 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 211"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95914/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.5631578947368423,4.214912280701755,4.2631578947368425,1,2.7,1,4.2631578947368425,1,2.7,1,,266,281,,,,

We consider wonder as the joy of exploration and discovery. Preschoolers and even infants are driven to learn not just facts and statistics, but also underlying causal patterns that are at the heart of many sciences. They learn not just as individual but also as members of knowledge communities and, early on, they sense how to ""harvest"" knowledge from these communities. Yet, those joyous moments of discovery and exploration often fade as children grow older and cease to wonder. We explore how this decline occurs and its consequences.  When people stop wondering, they fail to expand their grasps of the world and become ever more vulnerable to misunderstanding and manipulation by others. We examine possible ways to reverse the decline.",Prerequisite: PSYC 110 or CGSC 110. ,CO100 180B - 100 College Street 180B,M 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""CO100 180B - 100 College Street 180B"",""""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94784/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,2.607142857142857,4.75,4.75,1,2.142857142857143,1,4.75,1,2.142857142857143,1,,271,286,,,,

A major part of each topic presentation will be a discussion of the role that play has in the curriculum in enhancing these developmental areas. There is a widespread consensus that play is an essential component of a developmentally appropriate early childhood curriculum. Research indicates that play enhances a child’s creativity, intellectual development and social emotional development. Because learning to play, learning language and learning literacy skills are all part of the process of thinking and communication, the course will provide a view which attempts to demonstrate the integration of language, literacy and play in an early childhood education curriculum. Theoretical aspects of each of these developmental areas will be examined first, and it will be that theoretical understanding which will be the basis upon which ideas about curriculum will be explored, experienced and discussed.

622,202401,1,Imagining the Invisible in the Roman World,"Ancient Mediterranean people were surrounded by images of ‘invisible’ things—the gods, the dead, and even a few ghosts. Seeing the gods themselves ‘in the flesh’ happened only rarely for the Romans, but images of those same divinities were everywhere—at home, in the marketplace, and at colossal scale in temples and sanctuaries. This course analyzes the ways in which Romans imagined these ‘invisible’ beings, excavating their imaginings through texts and objects. The material covered traces ancient imagination of invisible beings from Celtic cauldrons to Roman poets, and marble statues to painted synagogues. By looking at how the ‘invisible’ was represented we may discover much about how these unseen beings were understood, but also something about how Roman art worked as a representational system.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

649,202401,1,Is Rhetoric a Good Thing? The Debate Between Rhetoric and Philosophy,"This course introduces students to the Greek and Roman sources of a tension that has shaped the contemporary humanities: the debate between philosophy and rhetoric, between ideals of truth and powers of persuasion. Beginning with an in-depth study of Plato’s attack on rhetoric in the Gorgias, a deeply ambiguous text in which Socrates’ championing of philosophy actually seems to fail, we examine Plato’s rehabilitation of rhetoric in the Phaedrus as a means of leading souls towards truth; Cicero’s attempt to combine rhetoric and philosophy in Book III of his dialogue On the Orator; and Quintilian’s effort to inspire moral commitment in the readers of his rhetorical treatise On the Education of the Orator.  In the latter part of the course, we encounter new voices entering the debate and adding their own unique concerns: Augustine’s conflicted feelings towards his rhetorical education in the Confessions; Isotta Nogarola’s spirited entrance into a tradition of rhetorical and philosophical debate defined and dominated by men; and Petrus Ramus’ attack on the unity of rhetoric and morality that dramatically altered the shape of humanistic studies. We conclude the course with Danielle Allen’s chapter ""Rhetoric, a Good Thing"" in Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship since Brown v. Board of Education, which frames rhetoric as a useful tool for forging civic bonds in troubled political times.",,HQ 209 - Humanities Quadrangle 209,TTh 9am-10:15am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""9:00"",""10:15"",""HQ 209 - Humanities Quadrangle 209"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]],""Thursday"":[[""9:00"",""10:15"",""HQ 209 - Humanities Quadrangle 209"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93512/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.833333333333333,4.6893939393939394,4.833333333333333,1,3.0,1,4.833333333333333,1,3.0,1,,327,359,,,,

We reflect on the function of sympotic gatherings in Athens, read and interpret sympotic poetry, and reflect on the themes it addresses and on what it can tell us about the symposium-event itself. We study the pictorial record and ask whether it depicts actual sympotic contexts or rather sets up the symposium as a place of the imagination.

Students learn about the history of the discipline, terminology, and numismatic methodology, as well as museum aspects and approaches to the field. Students handle objects from the Yale University Art Gallery’s Numismatic Collection, the largest university collection in North America. This course aims to provide a chronological and geographical overview from the birth and development of coinage in the 7th century B.C. to the 20th century. The course takes an empirical approach to numismatics based on the study of the objects themselves.

683,202401,1,Introduction to Machine Learning,"This course focuses on fundamental topics in machine learning. We begin with an overview of different components of machine learning and types of learning paradigms. We introduce a linear function, discuss how one can train a linear function on a given dataset, and utilize it to tackle classification and regression problems. We then consider kernel methods to enable us to solve nonlinear problems. Additionally, we introduce the concept of generalization error and overfitting. We discuss the role of regularization and extend linear regression to ridge regression. We also cover optimization, beginning from gradient descent and extending it to stochastic gradient descent and its momentum variant; the concept of alternating optimization; the curse of dimensionality; and topics on dimensionality reduction. We conclude the course with neural networks: how to build them using the topics discussed, how to optimize them, and how to apply them to solve a range of machine learning tasks.","Students should have passed courses in data structures and object-oriented programming (e.g. CPSC 223a or equivalent courses), foundational mathematical tools such as discrete math and linear algebra (e.g. CPSC 202 or equivalent courses), calculus (e.g. MATH 112, MATH 115, MATH 120, or equivalent courses), linear algebra (e.g. MATH 225, or equivalent courses), and artificial intelligence (e.g. CPSC 370/570).

702,202401,1,Trustworthy Deep Learning,"In recent years, deep learning has seen applications in many fields, from science and technology, to finance, humanity, and businesses. However, real-world, high-impact machine learning applications demand more than just model performance. In particular, deep learning models are often required to be ""trustworthy,"" so that domain experts can trust that the models consistently behave in a way that corresponds to their domain knowledge. For example, medical experts would expect a deep learning diagnosis model to be able to explicitly utilize medical domain knowledge in its prediction; an insurance company would expect a decision on insurance price to be explainable in terms of risk factors; a financial company would expect its fraud detection model to be robust to adversarial attacks; a physicist would expect models to provide consistency with the underlying laws. This course introduces various fields of trustworthy deep learning, including model robustness, defenses for adversarial attacks, interpretability, explainability, fairness, privacy, domain adaptation, rules, and constraints. The course covers some of these aspects in the context of graph neural networks but also covers many other ML models in general deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.","Prerequisites: a course in linear algebra and multi-variable calculus.

713,202401,1,"Contemporary Pilgrimages–or, Thinking on Your Feet","In recent years, the number of people walking traditional pilgrimage routes around the globe has increased notably. Most exist because of the importance of their destinations to organized religions, yet many contemporary pilgrims identify their reasons for walking—often hundreds of miles—as secular. Several long hiking trails, although they have no religious origin, offer similar experiences and might be considered secular pilgrimage routes. This course asks if it is meaningful to speak of secular pilgrimages, and if such journeys share any of the purposes of religious ones? These include enlightenment/liberation, penance/atonement, and healing. Must a pilgrimage have a pre-established destination or route? Must it be walked, or can it be covered by other means? Can one set one’s own destination and route, and one’s own goal(s)? One author we read crossed much of North America, on foot or by human-powered means, from Florida to Quebec’s Gaspe peninsula, to see if a Florida panther could find its way across its historic range and to advocate for ""rewilding"" the landscape. Another retraced sections of the Underground Railroad, photographing sites associated with it. Is pilgrimage a useful term/practice to address the challenges of contemporary life?

Or a piece might be structured around the experiences of its subjects and the feelings those experiences engendered. The whole conception can grow from an emotion: anger, sadness, perhaps love.

In many traditions worldwide, it is considered a foundational feature of representative democracy and a guarantee against arbitrariness and domination. In this course, we critically review this principle. We reconsider the NTWR principle historically, analyzing its shortcomings in a world with limited citizenship and democracy. In many instances, the NTWR principle helped (and keeps helping) a powerful minority to protect their wealth against democratic redistribution instead of expanding citizenship and strengthening democracy. The NTWR principle also tends to legitimize a very narrow approach to democracy, which requires citizens to pay taxes in exchange for political rights and overlooks other social contributions. It is also an approach that highlights the shortcomings of democracy in addressing the challenges of intergenerational justice, corporative citizenship, and the international order, among others. Considering its limitations, this course presents alternatives to rethink the interaction between democracy, citizenship, and taxation beyond the NTWR principle.",Students may enroll in no more than 1 RCS for credit in a given term. ,HQ 317 - Humanities Quadrangle 317,T 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""HQ 317 - Humanities Quadrangle 317"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95840/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Please state briefly (under 1000 characters) your interest in this course and any relevant experience.

727,202401,1,Game Theory in Action: From Poker to Business Negotiations,"Negotiation is essential: it is only the alternative to violence and coercion in public policy and a prerequisite to all economic activity. The food on your table and the music in your ears could not exist without a long, complex series of negotiations. Professionals negotiate with clients and counterparties, colleagues, suppliers, friends, and family.  Yet, few of us consider ourselves confident, expert negotiators. We fear that we will be exploited and deceived (leaving money on the table) or that others will see us as too demanding or too greedy (and therefore untrustworthy). Game Theory in Action brings math and logic to the bargaining table. Students compete in seven simulated negotiations, beginning with poker and toy games and progressing to business situations drawn from the sports and entertainment industry. Poker is our entry point to game theory, teaching us to estimate the expected value of each potential gambit, detect patterns in opponents’ behavior, and bluff selectively to avoid being exploited. We then apply these principles to business situations, building our negotiation skills via role plays. Each negotiation is scored based on the value captured by each student relative to the rest of the class, with coaching, in-class post-mortems, and peer feedback.",Prerequisites: High school algebra and statistics.,LC 211 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 211,Th 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""LC 211 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 211"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95844/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,Please state briefly (under 1000 characters) your interest in this course and any relevant experience.,No regular final examination,False,False,True,1.5263157894736845,4.7894736842105265,4.7894736842105265,1,3.263157894736842,1,4.7894736842105265,1,3.263157894736842,1,,399,432,,,,

786,202401,1,"What Happened to Socialism-Chinese Cinema and Society, 1905-2015","What happened to socialism? This course offers an in-depth exploration of this question through the lens of Chinese cinema, from its early days in the early 20th century to the contemporary era. Students examine China's social, political, and cultural transformations, from heteronomy to autonomy, and the ideological transition from socialism to postsocialism. Is socialism with Chinese characteristics interchangeable with capitalism with Chinese characteristics? What impact has revolutionary politics had on Chinese cinema? What is feminism with Chinese characteristics? How do the radical transformations that occurred in China during the 1980s and 1990s manifest in the aesthetics and narratives of Chinese films? How have spatial consciousness and construction of images informed filmmaking in China? How are the sentiments of alienation, disconnection, and displacement depicted in Chinese films? Does globalization bring us closer together or push us towards solitude? The course explores these questions by delving into the cultural dynamics of China's changing identities and ideologies in response to its integration into capitalist globalization. Topics include the evolution of Chinese film generations, cultural politics, postsocialist decay, aesthetics and method of seeing, kinship and love, violence and solitude, fragmentation and disconnection, and feminism with Chinese characteristics in Chinese films.

We read poetry and prose featuring mothers, daughters, and lovers, novels that follow convenience and thrift store workers, and poetry about factory girls. Our reading takes us from the daily grind of contemporary Tokyo to dystopian futures, from 1970s suburbia to surreal dreamscapes. We attend carefully to the ways in which different writers craft their works and, in particular, to their representation of feelings and affects. Whether the dull ache of loneliness, the oppression of boredom or the heavy weight of fatigue, it is often something about the mood of a work–rather than its narrative–that leaves a distinct impression. We develop the tools to analyze and discuss this sense of distinctness, as well as discover ways to stage connections and comparisons between the works we read.",,HQ C07 - Humanities Quadrangle C07,M 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""HQ C07 - Humanities Quadrangle C07"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93652/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.6000000000000005,4.7,4.4,1,2.8,1,4.4,1,2.8,1,,431,481,,,,

We then move onto stories of how women and men survived the Cold War, developmentalist, and dictatorial regimes of South Korea from 1945 to 87.

What is the ideological, economic, and socio-political function of popular culture in South Korea today? What makes Korean popular culture attractive to a global audience who are not necessarily familiar with the Korean language and culture? How do they embrace and smooth over linguistic and cultural differences in the process of consuming Korean cultural content?

Joining techniques of historical and literary analysis, it examines how Chinese and Russian political and cultural developments mutually shaped the two countries’ ideologies, cultures, and social movements.

The legacy of this early Sino-Russian contact remains with us in the twenty-first century, as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping evoke memories of early alliances, while Russian and Chinese dissidents appeal to Western liberal powers to support their resistance to authoritarian rule.

In implementing the governance blueprints of rulers and thinkers, law formulated the operations of East Asian empires and kingdoms, as well as their people's life in nearly all aspects.

Starting with early legal theories, it explores the traditional East Asian ideas of 'justice' and how the law attempted to achieve them under imperial rule and major religious beliefs.

834,202401,1,Ethnic Art and Contemporary China,"For thousands of years, imperial China found its deepest expression in a tradition of literary art—a tradition so potent that frontier and conquered peoples who learned to use it might, by conventional wisdom of the day, become Chinese. Today, the Chinese nation claims many such groups as ""minority ethnicities,"" and a tradition of Chinese language and literature remains the crucial conduit through which all residents of the nation must seek education and employment. At the same time, state policies increasingly codify and regulate the ""different"" artistic practices identified with minority ethnic groups. Running through this history is a common thread: aesthetic production, whether imperial, national, or culturally ""other,"" has been and remains a site of symbolic struggle over the terms of Chinese-ness. We trace such struggles from two angles, first considering the ways that ethnic art is (mis)interpreted in contemporary mainstream Chinese culture, and second, seeking an understanding of ethnic art practices in their own terms, with attention to how they comment on their popular representations. The course offers an introduction to ethnicity in China and to the sociality and politics of artistic production.

It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans—""Southern Barbarians,"" i.e. Europeans—began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as baroque, rococo, mestizo, and even global modernity are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan’s great military hegemons.",,LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LORIA 358 - Loria Center 358"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94520/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,2.0,4.291666666666666,4.25,1,2.25,1,4.25,1,2.25,1,,457,507,,,,

1042,202401,1,History of the English Language,"The story of the English language is a remarkable one. During its 1,500-year history, English has gone through striking changes. For example, in the early Middle Ages, the word take did not exist in English; it was later borrowed from the language of the Vikings. When a person in the 16th century claimed that someone was nice, they meant that the person was foolish. In the 17th century, her could be spelled har, her, hor, hur, and hyr by people living in the same community. And more recently we see how like has taken on new functions, especially in quotations. We will explore how and why these, and other developments took place. We look at how major historical events have spurred changes in the English language, and how people from all walks of life (from well-known authors like Shakespeare and Austen to anonymous scribes and letter writers) influence the path of change.

1060,202401,1,Laboring through the Middle Ages,"Society is stratified, and the Haves seem to inhabit a different world than the Have-Nots. The work you do—or don’t do—determines not just the way you live, but your value as a human being. And then a pandemic arrives, and in its aftermath society and its rules for work don’t seem so natural after all...This is the 2020s, but it’s also the 1350s, when the Black Death laid waste to Europe’s population and caused both revolt and retrenchment. In the generation after the plague, society both changed and didn’t; and those who survived produced some of the greatest literary art of the Middle Ages. In this junior seminar, we explore the ideology of work (and its opposite, idleness) across the Middle Ages in England. We consider big questions, like: are you different from what you do? Is art work? Is prayer? Should you have to work to get into heaven? And why does anyone have to work at all? This course covers a time period that is both very different from and eerily similar to our own. Students experience some great works of visual and verbal art, and the manuscripts and artifacts in which they’re embodied—the visible, tangible result of medieval labor. Students develop perspective on what labor meant in the Middle Ages, and means to us today.",,LC 203 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 203,MW 1pm-2:15pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""LC 203 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 203"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]],""Wednesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""LC 203 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 203"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93685/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.5714285714285712,4.642857142857142,4.285714285714286,1,2.7142857142857144,1,4.285714285714286,1,2.7142857142857144,1,,556,638,,,,

How do poets hear echoes from the past and amplify, distort, and transform what they hear into their own unique voices in the present? And what’s really at stake in such transformations? (Why write a poem, after all?)

Along the way, we explore a variety of approaches to making the past come alive in the present; through the ""what if"" posed by alternate history speculations, through didactic history in fact and fiction imagined for children, the use of the past as a site of romance, and through visual media like paintings and cinema. Throughout the course, we address questions like: how does fiction work to interpret the past? How does our interpretation of the past reflect and help us process present day concerns?

1073,202401,1,"Global Encounters on the English Stage, 1650-1800","In the aftermath of the English Civil War, when England began heavily prioritizing its imperial ambitions, the theater responded with an expanding repertoire of plays set in world empires: the Ottoman and Chinese Empires; the Aztec and Incan Empires; the empires of Morocco and Russia and India. This theatrical fascination with global empires, and with England’s own imperial expansions in North America, dominated the stage deep into the eighteenth century. In this course, we analyze this repertoire to interrogate the role of the stage in establishing and promoting—as well as questioning and problematizing—the categories of cultural and racial difference used to justify and determine England’s expanding, and often violent, global mercantile empire. In addition to close-reading of the play-texts, particular emphasis is placed on stagecraft and spectacle (including music, costumes, and scenery); on actor/actress studies; and on performance and adaptation history. We also look at how the English theater’s history of racial and cultural categorization still persists in Anglo-American theater today and ask how knowledge of this history can inform current conversations on the moral complexities of staging pre-modern plays.",,LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319,MW 11:35am-12:50pm,"{""Monday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]],""Wednesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93717/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.875,4.625,4.5,1,2.625,1,4.5,1,2.625,1,,569,651,,,,

1079,202401,1,The Badness of Victorian Poetry,"This course studies Victorian poetry and its fraught reception in twentieth- and twenty-first-century literary criticism. As we examine how the modern discipline of literary studies developed out of, and often against, Victorian poetics and aesthetics, we attend to key concepts like form, method, judgment, pedagogy, value, period, and canon. We begin by considering Victorian poetry’s implication in the modernist aesthetic category of ""badness,"" and the status of Victorian poems as negative examples in the early theorization of classroom close-reading practices. After establishing the conflict between literary method and the Victorian poem, we turn to Victorian poetry itself. What were its characteristic features? How did it come to be seen as both too simple and too ornate, both too constrained and too maudlin, both too juvenile and too sensual, both too moralizing and too preoccupied with beauty? How did the Victorians understand the aesthetic and ideological work of poetry, and how did later poets and critics misunderstand what the Victorians were trying to do? And what happens when we return to nineteenth-century theories of art and poetry or apply new interpretive methods to Victorian poems?",Prerequisite: ENGL 125 or 126 (or equivalent),LC 203 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 203,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 203 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 203"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93732/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,575,657,,,,
1080,202401,1,What is Criticism For?,"Literary and art criticism sometimes seem a bit hard to justify. Why spend so much time discussing books and artworks? What does it achieve? The same is sometimes said of literary and artistic education. What use is an English major? Do artsy types perform any useful social function? Many sophisticated thinkers have tried to answer these questions, and in this course we read some of the most interesting of them. We focus on thinkers who were writing between 1850 and 1950, and on two traditions of thought in particular: an English Liberal tradition (represented by figures such as John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, Virginia Woolf, and E.M. Forster), and a European Marxist one (represented by figures such as Karl Marx, Alexandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Trotsky, and Antonio Gramsci). Their answers are often surprising. Judging by these thinkers, it seems that if you want to understand what criticism is good for, then you need to develop nothing less than a thoroughgoing account of the whole of human life–a big ask! By the end of the course, we should be in a better position to think seriously about the social function of literary criticism, art criticism, and aesthetic education.",,LC 104 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 104,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 104 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 104"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93738/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,2.0000000000000004,4.476190476190476,4.666666666666667,1,2.6666666666666665,1,4.666666666666667,1,2.6666666666666665,1,,576,658,,,,

A warning: this is a course about fantasy, but it is also very much a course about genre, so please don’t sign up unless you are really committed to undertaking a rigorous literary-critical investigation of that concept. The problems of genre are many and vexing, and we grapple with them in a serious manner by asking questions such as: what are genres? What kinds of factors lead to new genres arising, and old ones transforming or dying away? When genres change, are these changes primarily due to factors internal to the genre itself, such as the presence of unexplored possibilities inherent in its existing formal structures, or are they primarily due to external factors such as economic, political, and/or cultural upheavals in the society at large? What are ‘genre systems,’ and what conditions lead to changes in them? And so on. My point: by all means come for the dragons, but please be prepared to stay for the genre.

They’ll emerge from it equipped with a new set of skills, making them sharper readers, bolder creative writers, and better editors. Reading as an editor offers students a unique perspective on today’s literary landscape, deepens their understanding of style, form, and genre—and gives them practical skills involved in 21st-century publishing. Students are introduced to the concept of assigning pieces and thinking about what kind of magazine stories can add value to an ever-more fast-paced and reactive media landscape.

1086,202401,1,Writing from the Archive: Imagining the Real,"Where do the dry, who-what-which details set down on a census form meet the far messier and richer reality of the people whose names are scrawled there? And how might a writer bring that meeting about? What can a shoebox of doodle-filled letters tell us about the ways that friendship, art, war, sex, and politics struck a couple of New York novelists, c. 1941? How do we respond as writers and as a culture when faced with the lack of such inky particulars? Blending seminar and workshop, this class explores in an intensive, hands-on fashion multiple approaches to writing about archival materials—outside the realm of scholarship and theory. We dig into documents of all sorts as we also read essays, biographies, and other literary works that wrestle with the complex, sometimes slippery fact of the archive. Weekly prose experiments that draw from various Yale collections and beyond encourage students to see and respond to archival discoveries freshly and for themselves.",,HQ 123 - Humanities Quadrangle 123,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""HQ 123 - Humanities Quadrangle 123"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94131/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,0.5,4.375,4.375,1,3.875,1,4.375,1,3.875,1,,582,664,,,,

In this writing intensive course, we reimagine and employ fiction’s tools through a speculative lens to render a realistic experience. What is the difference between building an entirely fabricated world and placing one discreet supernatural element into an otherwise realistic story? How can we manipulate time on the page to most effectively express life’s most extraordinary experiences? Our focus is on peer review of student stories produced in tandem with craft lessons that address the concerns of the uncanny and speculative-based writing prompts.

Does it mean equality of condition? Equality of result? Equality of opportunity? Equality in the eyes of God? Is inequality always harmful? The purpose of this course is to critically examine various conceptions of the term that have emerged throughout history in order to inform our understanding of contemporary debates over political, social, and economic equality in Western and non-Western contexts. In the first half of the course, we scrutinize premodern defenses and criticisms of equality in the thought of Plato and Aristotle and in Christian, Islamic, and Confucian traditions. We then investigate modern thinkers’ conceptions of the idea of equality, spanning from John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Karl Marx to advocates of the French Revolution, and probe the connection between equality and the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. In the second half of the course we use this intellectual framework to address more recent debates over the meaning of equality regarding luck egalitarianism; the limits of egalitarianism; distributive justice; equality versus equity; and racial equality. Additional themes include equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome; the relation between equality and justice; the tension between equality and liberty; the relation between equality and democracy; non-Western conceptions of equality; and global efforts to reduce socioeconomic disparities.",,HLH31 108 - 31 Hillhouse Avenue 108,T 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""HLH31 108 - 31 Hillhouse Avenue 108"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559990""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95680/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,0.833333333333333,4.184523809523809,4.583333333333333,1,3.75,1,4.583333333333333,1,3.75,1,,615,702,,,,

Our discussions look at the characteristics of democratic leaders and debate whether America, the bulwark of liberal democracy in the 20th century, is still an exporter of democracy and how that matters in today’s world. We then look at how to protect and adapt democratic institutions such as free elections, civil society, dissent, and the free press in the face of a rising wave of populism and nationalism. The course examines how refugee crises from conflict regions and immigration impact democracies and debate the accelerating paradigm shifts of income inequality and technology on democratic institutions.  We conclude the course with a discussion of the forms of democratic governance that are meaningful in the 21st century and the practicalities of designing or reforming democratic institutions to confront current challenges.",,RKZ 05 - Rosenkranz Hall 05,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""RKZ 05 - Rosenkranz Hall 05"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559923""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94962/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.8888888888888888,4.777777777777778,4.777777777777778,1,2.888888888888889,1,4.777777777777778,1,2.888888888888889,1,,620,707,,,,

Hobbes was a liberal absolutist or an absolutist liberal. Can we make sense of this strange combination? Does the modern state still embody such tensions? Our text is Leviathan in its entirety. After finishing Leviathan, we turn, at the end of the semester, to Hobbes’ students, heirs, and critics in the twentieth century: Hannah Arendt, C.B.

Can work be a source of meaning in our lives? Is there anything inherently bad about working or are the ways work is currently structured bad? Do we have a right to work? Do we have a duty to work? Should power structures at workplaces match those of a country (e.g., be democratic)? Would it be preferable to severely reduce work hours or completely eliminate work? Should we use technology to automate not only jobs but also housework and errands?

Interpersonal relationships are a central part of our lives. As social creatures, they are essential for our well-being and the meaningfulness of our lives. But they raise important moral questions. For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person? We also explore psychological and moral aspects of these relationships, e.g., what does loving a person consist of? What reasons do we have to love others?

1179,202401,1,Latinx Activism in the United States,"This course examines the history of political mobilization among Latinx populations from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. As the students learn about different case studies of activism, the class introduces them to basic concepts and historical debates about human rights, social justice, cultural hegemony, decoloniality, and epistemologies of the global south. Each case study challenges the image of a passive Latinx population, and illustrates the continuing struggles for social change, social justice, and equality. Finally, the class materials discuss how the diverse Latinx experience have shaped the types of political mobilization, and how these movements have also helped to transform the American political landscape that we have today. Class readings include case studies in labor and education activism, women’s political mobilization, transnational political movements, migration justice movements, and countercultural movements.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

1201,202401,1,Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures,"The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?

1202,202401,2,"Reading Environments: Nature, Culture, and Agency","Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America.

1216,202401,1,World Literature: Problems and Case Studies,"The idea of ""world literature"" seems self-evident, despite numerous divergences and transformations since Goethe put the weight of his authority behind it in the middle the 19th Century. World literature, according to the standard view, is an international canon of ""great books"" that traveled between languages and survived as enduring cultural milestones. The frequently untransparent processes that lie behind such transformations are, however, also an enduring problem, as is the question of disciplinary competency for multiple languages, histories, conceptions and traditions. How can anyone speak for ""world literature""? Where does literary history and interpretation intersect with anthropology? It is also easy to argue that the urge toward inclusive universalism is self-contradictory. The cosmopolitan concept of world literature is itself under suspicion of being Eurocentric, colonialist, touristic and ideological. World literature may also refer to the equally capacious concept of myth; to imaginative works of world-building; to works in which the concept of world is itself transformed; to works in which ""the world"" is at stake.",,HQ 123 - Humanities Quadrangle 123,Th 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""HQ 123 - Humanities Quadrangle 123"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95629/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,677,765,,,,

1234,202401,1,Chornobyl: A History of Energy and the Environment,"Chornobyl often serves as a universal symbol of nuclear, ecological, and cultural catastrophe in modern history, comparable to only a handful of other watershed disasters such as the 1984 Bhopal pesticide plant gas leak in India or the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in Japan. Did the Chornobyl reactor explosion simply reveal the fundamental weaknesses of the planned economy and the socialist state, or was it the first major challenge to the post-Cold-War order of global capitalism and atomic modernity? By exploring the moments of energy transitions from organic economy to fossil fuel (coal, oil, and natural gas) to atom, we consider how different energy regimes shaped our visions of the modern future. Under both capitalism and socialism, the construction of nuclear power plants and adjacent atomic towns exemplified the attempts to create utopian spaces, prototypes of either the free world or the communist society. This initial nuclear optimism regarding ""peaceful atom"" and the subsequent post-Chornobyl catastrophism and apocalyptic ""post-progress"" leads us to the discussion on how atomic energy modified the relations between humanity and the environment established during the nineteenth-century industrialization and whether we need a new environmental history of toxicity to grasp these shifts. We therefore engage with oral histories of refugees from the Chornobyl exclusion zone and the remaining residents, reporting on disaster tourism, stalker mass culture, and biomedical investigations to understand life in people-less wastelands and on the edges of ""catastrophe"" zones, to examine nuclear waste management, to track the migration of Chornobyl-produced radioactive elements through global chains of food and commodity supply, and to explore the political consequences of post-Chornobyl environmentalism for Ukraine, other Eastern and Central European states, and the world.",,HQ C15 - Humanities Quadrangle C15,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""HQ C15 - Humanities Quadrangle C15"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95869/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.5384615384615379,4.615384615384615,4.615384615384615,1,3.076923076923077,1,4.615384615384615,1,3.076923076923077,1,,685,773,,,,

We explore the shifting significance of ""atmosphere"" through historical episodes including seventeenth-century matter theory, eighteenth-century medical climatology, nineteenth-century landscape painting, and twentieth-century atmospheric science. We analyze atmospheric texts and images (including paintings in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art) using methods from history of science, art history, affect theory, and critical race, disability, and queer studies. These tools help us understand how the impacts of climate change are compounding the historical injustices of racism and colonialism. The course includes a three-day field trip to the Gull Island Institute.

Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees. Some organisms adapt to extremes, while others cannot. Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms―from microbes to plants and animals―respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of ""one health"" for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world.

1258,202401,1,"Scared to Death: Fear, Threats, and Media","Fear is a dominant political, cultural, social, and economic force today. However, its importance is often overlooked, especially in film and media studies. While recent work has looked at our positive affective relationships with media, including fandom and cinephilia, the fear of media has been largely ignored. Yet, media are deeply accomplice of social anxieties. On the one hand, as they try to respond to and to resist these anxieties, they register and disseminate them. Media are often amplifiers of social distress. On the other hand, their action raises fears, either because they display aggressive behavior, or because they produce addiction – not to say the cases in which media break moral norms, make us to lose our sense of reality, or are instrumental of forms of bullying. Media can be improper weapons. This lecture course considers how media and fear intersect, asking both how technology mediates fear and how fear shapes our engagement with media. To this end, the course is broken into two main units. In the first, ""Fearing Media,"" we look at media as objects of fear, due to their nature as technological, modern, ephemeral, unfamiliar, attractive, and pervasive objects. In the second, ""Fears in the Age of Medias,"" we analyze how fear has historically circulated and how media have conveyed and transformed this emotion. In order to better explore fear as a concept and as an object of experience, every week we present both a theoretical framework and a case study. At the same time, we discuss forms of protection–including those provided by the so-called protective media–against the threats that media intercept and amplify. Readings include not only academic papers but also op-eds and articles in both print and digital publications.",,WLH 117 - William L.

How does literary criticism complement the work of translation? In what ways is the current mode of approaching translations in reviews lacking? How can we develop criteria to evaluate works in translation that acknowledge the role of the translator ? How do these activities – both translating and reviewing – enrich scholarly communities, webs of thought, networks of writers, students’ own ways of approaching and understanding a text?

1303,202401,1,Play: Theories and Practices,"Play has long been understood as an activity that is central to human life. Children learn through it, art and literature are created through and incite it, humans as social animals unite and clash through it. But for as important as play can seem, it is equally difficult to understand. What is play and what is not? What does play accomplish? What are its dangers? This seminar explores modern theories and practices of play with an emphasis on the German tradition. A main goal of the seminar is to build a solid foundation for our discussions of play through readings of influential theories by authors such as Schiller, Wittgenstein, Freud, Klein, and Caillois. In doing so, we engage a wide range of theoretical discourses including aesthetics, poetics, philosophy, sociology, psychology, and anthropology. These theories are complemented by studies of various practices of play, from drama by the avid gambler G.E. Lessing, to aleatoric compositional methods used by the poetic, visual, and musical avant-gardes of the 20th century, to contemporary uses of simulation and virtual worlds. Most importantly, we challenge ourselves to incorporate play into our own thought and work, setting out from the assumption that in order to approach play seriously, we must ourselves adopt a playful attitude. Critical and reflective writing assignments are complemented by creative assignments relying on elements of play such as randomness and collaboration.",,HQ 309 - Humanities Quadrangle 309,T 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""HQ 309 - Humanities Quadrangle 309"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95600/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.333333333333333,4.638888888888889,4.555555555555555,1,3.2222222222222223,1,4.555555555555555,1,3.2222222222222223,1,,727,829,,,,

Gargantua, the life-story of a giant born from his mother's ear, published two years after Pantagruel in 1534, has surprising answers to these questions and more.

1338,202401,1,East Asia's Engagement in Afro-Asian Solidarity,"This course studies the political, diplomatic, ideological, economic, and cultural interactions between post-World War II East Asian states and the Third World (primarily the continents of Afro-Asia) in the process of post-colonial national development. It raises two key questions: What were the East Asian perceptions of and reactions to Third World decolonization, in particular the movement of Afro-Asian solidarity? How was their engagement with Afro-Asian solidarity related to their own trajectory of post-war reconstruction, national liberation, state building, and cultivation of developmental model? By addressing these questions, this seminar examines the development of Afro-Asian solidarity and discusses the involvement of various East Asian states, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan), Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea), the Republic of Vietnam (ROV), and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). These discussions compare the East Asian states regarding their similarities and differences in interactions with the Third World. In the cases of ‘divided states’ in East Asia (i.e., China, Taiwan, North-South Koreas, and North-South Vietnams), this course also emphasizes how one’s relationship with Afro-Asian solidarity affected that of the other side, and vice versa.","Suggested prerequisites: HIST 104, HIST 364, HIST 303, GLBL 207. ",HQ C65 - Humanities Quadrangle C65,W 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Wednesday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""HQ C65 - Humanities Quadrangle C65"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/96158/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.1428571428571432,4.428571428571429,4.428571428571429,1,3.2857142857142856,1,4.428571428571429,1,3.2857142857142856,1,,742,844,,,,

Topics include empire and exploitation, government regulation, matters of taste, war and famine, agriculture and nutritional science, consumer politics, industrial food production, and the globalization of food systems.

How did the vernacular of Eastern European Jewry shape the making of the modern Jewish self? We consider this development through the metaphor of ""the golden chain""—Yiddish as both a guarantor of continuity across diasporic time and space and as the medium through which the yoke of tradition could be loosened and broken. Topics and media include: translations/rewritings of the Bible, liturgy, rabbinic canon, and pan-European epic; Hasidic tales and the rise of modern Jewish fantasy; dramas, short stories, and novels set in the archetypical (Jewish) town known as the shtetl; popular theater and song; the daily newspaper; high modernist poetry; the golden era of cinema; wartime documentation and postwar memorialization; and the contemporary multimedia scene (Hasidic, left, kitsch).",,WLH 202 - William L.

The course challenges the traditional view that religion (especially Christianity and Judaism) is an ally of capitalism and explores alternatives to this natural bond. Among these alternatives, we observe some socialist, anarchist, and Marxist thinkers and theologians who draw on religious sources to support their activism or use religion as a source to develop critiques of capitalism. Through reading texts by authors such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, and Gorgio Agamben, Saidiya Hartman, Gustav Landauer, Hermann Cohen, Erich Fromm, José Miranda, and Gustavo Gutiérrez, among others, we learn about how religion and capitalism are intertwined and how they shape the world in which we live.",,WLH 202 - William L.

1382,202401,1,Politics of Performance,"The stage is, and always has been, a political space. Ever since its beginnings, theatre has offered ways to rethink and criticize political systems, with the stage serving as a ""moral institution"" (Schiller) but also as a laboratory for models of representation. The stage also delineates the limits of representation for democratic societies (Rousseau), as it offers the space for experimentation and new modes of being together, being ensemble. The stage also raises the question of its own condition of possibility and the networks it depends on (Jackson). This course revisits the history of German and German speaking theatre since the Enlightenment, and discusses the stage in its relationship to war, the nation state, the social question, femicide and gender politics, the Holocaust, globalization, and 21st century migration.

Time and Space in the Telling of History,"This course introduces first-year Yale College students to the fundamental considerations of representing time and space in historical writing. Non-historians often imagine that historical time and geographical space are too fixed and large for humans to modify for their analytical purposes. To many, the vast expanse of the earth and the deep time of human experience seem so unwieldy that they operate silently as constants in the imagination, seeming to move slowly or imperceptibly in contrast to an immediate and urgent present. Considerations of the time and space within which the present exists may be contemplated or understood but they are rarely woven articulately or explicitly into daily human experiences of the current moment. And yet no matter how remote or disjointed the past seems from the present to most, historians must reckon with the problem of orienting human experience in both time and space. In this seminar, students are introduced to a series of both foundational and controversial methods of understanding how to place historical events in global and word-historical contexts.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

We study past forms of inequality and importantly, how societies explained and justified the existence of often pronounced inequality, and then turn to the question what sustains inequality today. Topics covered are inequalities of income, of banking and money, housing, health, education, opportunity, among others. Each of these topics have readings that allow us to trace back the history of such issues as well as readings that deal with contemporary expressions of the same problem.

Somewhat deftly we replaced one Hegelian narrative with another, now with a telos of peacefully coexistent liberal democracies bound together by free trade. February 24th, 2022 brought an end to the postcommunist narrative arc. ""The world is experiencing a turning point,"" German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced. This turning point is the end of the ""the end of History."" We now know that there is no such thing as a liberal teleology of progress. Fascism and totalitarianism are no less real today for taking on a postmodern form than they were nearly a century ago. The fall of what Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire—the most far-reaching social engineering experiment ever performed on mankind—has not brought about the dissolution of evil. This seminar examines the war in Ukraine largely from an intellectual history perspective, with attention to the meaning of the Soviet experiment; the rise of new regimes of tyranny drawing upon post-truth; what Hannah Arendt calls ""natality"" and the uniquely human capacity for action; and the problem of evil in a postmodern world.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

What does it mean to be a health ""activist"" and to demand change of medicine? Health care in America has always been political. In this seminar students explore the rich history of health activism and health advocacy in the modern United States, focusing primarily on the postwar period through the present day. Each week we encounter new varieties of grassroots organizing, individual activists, and advocacy organizations that have made political claims about health care and pushed for its reform. We examine how health activism shapes broader cultural conversations about health and the practice of medicine itself. This course does not aim to provide a comprehensive history of health activism in modern America, but rather takes a case study approach, for critical analysis of themes and tactics. For each session, students read a selection of essays, book chapters, or primary source materials about a particular variety of health activism. Through these readings, we discuss how the critiques of activists and the responses by medical practitioners reveal the significant impact of race, gender, class, and sexuality on the provision of health care in this country. We also consider how historians have approached this subject, both as scholars and participant-observers.

First, we consider the uneven chronological development of printing to better understand when and why print technologies were adopted. Second, we consider convergences, divergences, and circulations between Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and China to think about how recent transnational and global turns should shape the history of the book in East Asia.

1459,202401,1,Revolutionary Mexico,"The Mexican revolution erupted as a rebellion to overthrow president Porfirio Diaz after thirty years of oppressive rule, but it soon grew into a fierce conflict between warring factions to define the country's future. For certain revolutionaries, like Emiliano Zapata, this was a battle for the survival of their villages and the recovery of ancestral lands claimed by wealthy elites. For urban liberals, it was a fight to establish a democratic and secular state. Others yet- including industrial laborers, Indigenous leaders, and feminist activists-understood the revolution as a struggle against global capitalism and structures of power, like those of race and gender. As the defining event of modern Mexican history, the revolution casts a long shadow. Engaging in our own process of historical investigation, we ask: How did the revolution transform Mexican society? How do we make sense of the multiplicity of revolutionary experiences?

The class examines the transformative impact of fossil fuels in the nineteenth century, alongside widening global inequality. Moving into the twentieth century, we explore the push and pull between growing environmental consciousness and accelerating environmental harm. What was the relationship between decolonization and environmental awareness? How have environmental movements around the world learned from and been inspired by one another?

Students study the historical relationship between the ""mind sciences"" and the intertwined systems of capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy from the 17th century to the present. Students also examine the role some psychologists and related scientists and scholars have played in challenging and resisting those same intertwined systems and institutions.

1467,202401,1,"Money and Its Crimes: Forgers, Schemers, and Conmen","For as long as it has existed, people spending, producing, earning, legislating, or saving money have been confronted with its potential for deception. We look at the evolution of money through different forms (credit systems; coins, paper money) in the pre-modern era and then move forward from the 19th century, when arguably the wider availability of paper money, now firmly established financial markets, central banking, joint stock companies, and the principle of limited liability ushered in distinctly new and modern ways of understanding and encountering money. This new landscape of money also opened the doors to new criminal enterprises: Forgers who used the advent of paper money as an opportunity to produce counterfeit bills; conmen who lured gullible fellow citizens into their get-rich-quick schemes; dubious entrepreneurs who praised endless opportunities in the emerging markets of that time and age, in Latin America and the colonial world; and men like Charles Ponzi, after whom the notorious pyramid investment fraud is named, among other examples. How did societies historically view those engaging in such criminal activity, and what kind of laws, safeguards, and investigative tools were put in place to protect people from money crimes? How did understandings of what constituted such crimes, and what, accordingly, should be made illegal, change over time? How do we view what is now often referred to as ""white collar crime"" today, and what does the future of money crimes look like in the age of cryptocurrencies? Over the course of the semester, we combine different historical perspectives on these topics and questions.",,HQ 225 - Humanities Quadrangle 225,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""HQ 225 - Humanities Quadrangle 225"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94259/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.4166666666666665,3.9038461538461537,4.5,1,3.0833333333333335,1,4.5,1,3.0833333333333335,1,,836,944,,,,

1477,202401,1,Gender Expression Before Modernity,"What are the historical forms of gender non-conformity? This course investigates expressions of gender that were considered non-conforming within their historical contexts. Our point of departure is the idea that gender constitutes a ""useful category of historical analysis"" (Joan Scott). In this course we ask how deviant gender expression can be a category of historical analysis. How do we write history from the perspective of gender fluidity, non-binarism, and gender transgression? How can this history give us the tools to critique regnant norms of gender expression, then and now? How does this historical approach relate to trans* and non-binary people & movements today? The course is historically wide-ranging, from Antiquity to the Early Modern period, and geographically diverse, including Europe, the Middle East, and the colonial Americas. The breath of contexts enable us to consider broad patterns, continuities, and discontinuities. At the same time, we discuss the specificities of particular contexts, emphasizing the connection between gender fluidity/non-conformity, on the one hand, and local cultural norms around gender and sex, on the other. We investigate intellectual and cultural trends, as well as the lives of gender fluid/non-conforming individuals. We analyze sources drawn from law, medicine, religion, philosophy, visual arts & literature, biographies, and memoirs. All readings are in English translation.","No prior background is required.

Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495 during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495 in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December.

Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student’s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes.

Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student’s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes.

1484,202401,1,One-Term Senior Essay,"All senior History majors should attend the mandatory senior essay meeting in early September at a time and location to be announced in the online Senior Essay Handbook.
The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser. As a significant work of primary-source research, it serves as the capstone project of the History major. Seniors writing a two-term senior essay do not register for HIST 497; instead, they register for HIST 495 and HIST 496 (see description). History majors may choose to write a one-term independent senior essay in the first term of their senior year and register for HIST 497; however, students who choose the one-term senior essay option are not eligible for Distinction in the Major. The one-term essay must include a substantial research paper of no more than 6,250 words (approximately twenty-five pages) based on primary sources, along with a bibliographic essay and bibliography. Seniors enroll during the fall term of senior year; only History majors graduating in December may enroll during the spring term (or seventh term of enrollment). In rare circumstances, with the permission of the adviser and the Senior Essay Director, a student enrolled in HIST 497 during the fall term may withdraw from the course according to Yale College regulations on course withdrawal and enroll in the spring term. Each student enrolled in HIST 497 must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook.

We study violence in the Global North and Global South, with special attention to South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, while eschewing cultural essentialism and exploring transnational linkages. A discussion of everyday experiences of violence, including technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV), broadens into how violence is exacerbated in war and genocide, and its impact on health and well-being across the lifespan. A major focus is on violence prevention, reconciliation, and peacebuilding, including United Nations-led activities. Along with critically examining the political, cultural, legal, and discursive roles of the state, we analyze the efficacy of preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping operations. Assessing the extent to which survivor well-being and psycho-social support have been centered in processes of transitional justice and socioeconomic reconstruction, and unpacking the politics of representation, we advocate for trauma-informed policy changes and transformative healing.",,TBA,TBA,{},[],"[""So""]",1.0,,,,CANCELLED,,Course is canceled!,HTBA,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,848,956,,,,

To explore these relationships, the course takes an interdisciplinary approach—examining historical foundations of peacebuilding, theories of health as a pathway to peace, ethical considerations in conflict and health, and root cause analysis of conflict and its implications for peacebuilding. The course begins with foundational approaches to health and peacebuilding through historical and ethical perspectives, then delves into case studies of health and peace: conflict as a public health problem with determinants, prevention strategies, rehabilitation efforts, and management; mental health in conflict and post-conflict settings; epidemic surveillance in conflict zones; humanitarian ceasefires; early childhood development and intergenerational strategies for peace. We conclude with an analysis of the importance of global health diplomacy, sustainable strategies for peace, and measuring peacebuilding efforts.

Through an in-depth analysis of key historical outbreaks and biosecurity paradigms, we explore the multifaceted and often sectorized approach to biosecurity as it informed global health history and practice. We examine longstanding themes (stigma, risk, isolation, and exclusion) along with the critical links between the histories of biosecurity and global health. From plague quarantines to epidemiologic innovations in tracking disease, and from malaria eradication campaigns to climate change efforts, we consider the entangled histories of security and international health as they together produced response networks, government policies, international organizations efforts, and colonial continuities in global health practices and programs. We conclude with an analysis of pressing problems in biosecurity, including biosafety, genome mapping, and infodemics of the twenty-first century.

Bhakti and Bhakti poets have influenced Bollywood in various ways. This connection is seen through Bollywood movies that portray the life and times of saint-poets and adopt their poetry directly.

1505,202401,1,"Nature and Art, or The History of Almost Everything","This global introductory course surveys the interrelation of nature and art from antiquity to the present. Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure. We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power.

1516,202401,1,London Art Capital: Black Death to Brexit,"Today London is a great art city—a cosmopolitan center for the making, display, and collecting of works of art. How did that come to be? This course answers the question through an intense engagement with the rich collections of the Yale Center for British Art, offering an introduction to British Art across six centuries and to the lively debates it generates. The course links the development of art and the art market with the origins and progression of capitalism. It traces London’s artistic and architectural development from medieval origins through the courtly spectacle of Tudor and Stuart eras to the emergence of a recognizably modern economy and society around 1750, the time of William Hogarth. After 1800, Londoners William Blake and JMW Turner, and their Victorian successors, vividly chronicled the transformation of the industrial and imperial city. From 1910 British art entered a complex relationship with European modernism epitomized in the work of sculptor Barbara Hepworth. London was shattered by bombing during the Blitz: from the ruins emerged Pop Art, followed by Op-Art, led by Bridget Riley. By the 1990s the prominence of artists of color such as Yinka Shonibare prefigured the dynamic and cosmopolitan art scene of the present day. After Brexit, after Covid, what is the future for British art and for London?",,TBA,TBA,{},[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,,,,CANCELLED,,,HTBA,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,859,969,,,,

1525,202401,1,"Making, Picturing, and Marking Space: American Art and Material Culture in the Long 19th Century","This introductory course to American material culture and art in the long nineteenth century takes ""space"" as its defining principle. From the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 to the outbreak of the First World War, the long nineteenth century was a formative and tumultuous period during which the nation consolidated its continental control and fashioned itself as an imperial power. Manifest destiny, expansionism, revolutions in transportation, and debates over land, labor, race, and national identity are defining features of the period. Progressing thematically and chronologically, this course considers how American artists and craftspeople navigated, contributed, and responded to these spatial politics. The class explores how the study of visual and material cultures offers nuanced insight into how the space of the nation is affirmed, contested, and negotiated. How and for whom is ""space"" made, and at whose expense? How do things emerge from, travel across, and define spaces? What role do artists and craftspeople play in transforming space into place?",,LORIA 360 - Loria Center 360,T 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""LORIA 360 - Loria Center 360"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94496/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.0,4.0,4.0,1,3.0,1,4.0,1,3.0,1,,863,973,,,,
1526,202401,1,The Materiality of Time in the Medieval Mediterranean,"What did time mean within the medieval world? And how did imagery and objects orient medieval viewers in time? Drawing on the collections in the Yale University Art Gallery and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, this seminar considers how time was experienced across the Medieval Mediterranean (ca. 300-1500) through manuscripts, observational tools, relics and their reliquaries, as well as monuments and architecture. While we explore the philosophy, science, and theology involved in temporal understandings, emphasis is placed on the objects and images associated with time, narratives, and calendars, especially those that would have been encountered regularly. Over the term, we also consider the temporal relationships created by objects: how medieval cultures conceived of and pictured their present, and how objects exerted their presence to beholders to create new, and sometimes competing understandings of the present. Through seminar conversations, direct engagement with medieval objects and manuscripts, and individual research projects, this course demonstrates the centrality of imagery in medieval understandings of time.",,LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259,M 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Monday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95920/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1,3.0,1,4.666666666666667,1,3.0,1,,864,974,,,,

In this class, we approach the art of the Aztec Empire through the lens of materiality, described by scholar Ann-Sophie Lehmann as understanding ""materials as active components in the conception, production, and interpretation of artworks."" Focusing each week on a different art material in conversation with theoretical and methodological readings on materiality, we ask how artists of the Aztec Empire engaged with the sensorial and ontological dimensions of their materials and how we can understand the materials themselves as active contributors to artworks and their meaning.

1532,202401,1,Rethinking Andean Landscapes,"This seminar reflects on the diverse ways in which different groups in South America, from the pre-Hispanic to the colonial period, articulated their relationship to the landscape. Many distinct cultures adapted to lush Amazonian forests, extreme altitudes of the Andes Mountains, parched desert coasts in the Pacific, and freezing Pacific waters. In order to survive, these civilizations developed unique relationships with the landscape and its resources, such as potatoes, coca leaves, marine life, cotton, alpaca, and metals like silver, gold, and copper. These relationships were significantly transformed by the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in social upheaval, religious conversion, new economies, the development of hybrid artistic styles, and ecological catastrophes. Our goal is to think critically about the kinds of objects and discourses we have to interrogate Andean relationships to the landscape.",,LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259,W 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95795/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.7999999999999998,4.6,4.6,1,2.8,1,4.6,1,2.8,1,,870,980,,,,

If a radical decarbonization of architectural practice stands as the discipline’s central challenge today, this calls not only for new solutions, but for different engagement with architecture’s history. This discussion seminar reinterprets histories of modern architecture through the concept of ""energy cultures."" An energy culture (Sheller, 2014; Szeemann and Diamanti, 2019) can be defined as the specific assemblage of fuel, matter, practice, labor, and meaning that have informed architecture’s conceptualization and construction. In contrast to approaches that stress quantitative, technical, and instrumental approaches to energy accounting and energy efficiency, this course looks at how different representations, concepts, and behaviors emerged in response to historic shifts in energy production and consumption. The first portion of the course surveys a range of historical approaches to concepts of energy and environmental justice within and adjacent to architecture. The bulk of the course then turns to case studies, examining particular buildings and projects in order to develop new interpretations and questions about these monuments based on an energy cultures approach.",,TBA,TBA,{},[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,,,,CANCELLED,,,HTBA,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,871,981,,,,

1535,202401,1,Making Climate Knowledge,"This is a course about how scientists have come to know what they know about our impacts on the earth’s climate and our vulnerability to climate change. At what point in history did humans become the first species to consciously alter the conditions of life on earth? What evidence did their knowledge rest on? Did scientists bear responsibility to warn of these consequences? These historical questions are pivotal to thinking today about who bears moral responsibility for the climate crisis and about future courses of action. Knowledge of the causes and impacts of climate change hinges on a range of disciplines, from ecology to agriculture to public health. In this course, we attend to the multiplicity of ways of knowing climate, as well as to the challenges of integrating them. We also track the historical entanglements of climate knowledge with imperialism, racism, and extractive capitalism. The course includes visits to the Yale Farm, the Peabody Museum’s collections, and the Yale Center for British Art, and a trip to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment.",,TBA,MW 11:35a-12:25p,"{""Monday"":[[""11:35"",""12:25"","""",""""]],""Wednesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:25"","""",""""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",0.0,,,,CANCELLED,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,3484,3918,,,,

We will read texts spanning 700 years of Italian language and culture, from epic to journalism, from chivalric romance to popularized science. Our readings will guide us on a long journey through what Italo Calvino called the cosmic vocation of Italian literature, from Dante Alighieri’s journey through the Heavens up to the works of contemporary scientists such as Guido Tonelli and Carlo Rovelli. In the last part of the course, students will actively engage with Calvino’s short stories in an workshop format.

How can we position ourselves in a city? How can cities bridge social, political, cultural differences to become more inclusive? How our perception of the urban landscape has changed during the centuries? This course explores the changing of Italian urban landscape from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance from a multidisciplinary and comparative perspective, from art to economics, from literature to urban design. We go through some discourses and representations of the city; maps, views, travel and narrative literature, tourist guides, films. These sources provide different ways to tell of the experience of the Italian urban environment, the evolutions of Italian towns, the changes in size and organization, the emergence of new spaces and new functions, as well as of new challenges (public health, demographic crisis, destructions, sacks, etc.). By considering the city as both a a physical and conceptual space, we eventually relate the material covered in class with the world outside: What is an ideal city? What is an invisible city?

First, the best way to master the craft of writing fiction is through reading and writing short stories. Second, there are no orphans in literature: Every writer has been influenced by other writers. Learning from masters is fundamental in all crafts. Looking for inspiration and expertise in Italian Literature, there is no doubt that Luigi Pirandello (winner of the Nobel Prize in 1934) is one of the most original writers in the world. In this course, we read and listen to the best of Pirandello’s short stories. Also, we study both his style and world vision. In this class, we utilize a workshop setting and use these short stories as creative and linguistic models to improve our own writing and linguistic skills.",Prerequisite: ITAL 140 or equivalent.,CO493 103 - 493 College Street 103,TTh 1pm-2:15pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""CO493 103 - 493 College Street 103"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560001""]],""Thursday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""CO493 103 - 493 College Street 103"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560001""]]}","[""L5""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95386/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,,4.0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,908,1029,,,,

1635,202401,1,Classical feminist debates and its Latin American Contributions: Critical Readings and Dissent,"Gender equality has been discussed and strived for centuries but has never been achieved. Starting from a broad conceptualization of feminism and considering the persistence and pervasiveness of women’s subordination, the course undergoes a reconstruction of feminist theories, following women’s struggles for equality, their different perspectives, and critical formulations. The traditional, established narratives are considered and confronted with non-hegemonic theorizations and experiences. By discussing feminism on the level of theory, the course intends to make explicit the critiques that feminist theory poses to dominant (self-declared ""neutral"") theoretical formulations and their methodologies. Thus, we explore some of the feminist and gender studies’ critiques of scientific-theoretical methodology, as well as the postulations of theory and methodology that claim to be feminist, in their multiplicity. We start from the Western European liberal feminist perspective to discuss, throughout the course, feminist formulations that put centrality to dimensions of race, ethnicity, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, coloniality, and their multiple intersections and entanglements. By articulating these theoretical approaches with the trajectories and traditions of women’s movements–situating and contextualizing them–, the course aims to address similarities and differences of agendas and narratives between movements in the Global North and South, especially from Latin America, in similar or different time frames.",,WLH 009 - William L.

Students learn to describe the production of sounds and signs (articulatory phonetics), discuss restrictions on sound and sign distribution (morphemic alternation, phonotactics), and develop a model of the phonological grammar in terms of rules and representations.

It also probes the status of an assertion as an answer to a question and investigates whether questions under discussion can account for the norm of relevance in discourse. Some of the main approaches to the semantics of questions are introduced, with special attention on linguistic phenomena. These include the notion of maximal informativity in answers, the distinction between mention-some and mention-all answers, differences between wh, alternative and polar questions, the truth requirement in questions and mirativity effects as reflected in restrictions in indirect questions, rhetorical questions and the use of interrogatives as imperatives. We pay special attention to why-questions and their connection to philosophical theories of explanation. While the course adopts the Hamblin-Karttunen approach to questions, it also addresses problems that arise in an Inquisitive Semantics approach to questions.",Prerequisite: LING 263 or permission of instructor.,WLH 204 - William L.

Topics range from theories of translation and ekphrasis to exoticism and untranslatability. Readings include classics by critics such as Aristotle, Ibn Sina, and Kristeva, and writers such as Marie de France, Nezami, and Calvino. It also engages with the literature of our own moment: we will read a newly-translated novel by the Chilean writer Nona Fernàndez, and the Iranian poet Kayvan Tahmasebian will visit the class for a conversation.

1664,202401,1,Reimaginings: South Asian Literatures Past and Present,"Freely ranging across languages, regions, traditions, and eras, this course introduces students to some of the many rich literary traditions of South Asia by pursuing strands of conversation between authors and texts. Such conversations frequently unfold through multiple languages and reach across centuries—even millennia.  Our aim is not to be comprehensive (indeed, given the vast diversity of South Asian literary cultures, comprehensiveness is not possible). Rather, the goal is to observe how authors writing in a range of genres and traditions were inspired by their classical pasts. For instance, we see how playwrights and poets reinterpret Sanskrit epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata; how ancient Buddhist poetry influences post-Independence writers; how classical Persian literature shapes modern Urdu poetry and English prose. Tracing such reimaginings reveals how creative engagement with the past has animated—and continues to shape—South Asian literary endeavors.","This course helps students acquire critical skills in close reading, analysis, and interdisciplinary thinking, with particular emphasis on formulating academic arguments and essay-writing.",PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207,T 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559570""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94190/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.823529411764706,4.705882352941177,4.411764705882353,1,2.588235294117647,1,4.411764705882353,1,2.588235294117647,1,,963,1093,,,,

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his imperial propaganda portray Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus as the ""Three Sisters"" (to borrow from Anton Chekhov’s famous play): three comparable nations (or, perhaps, in Putin’s view, one nation, a return of the historical ""Rus,"" divided into three countries). Today they face multilayered geopolitical, mental, and human crises, including full-scale war. These roots connect to the history of the entire area, have an impact on mass psychology, depend on conceptions of national character, and expose long-standing traumas and intergroup conflicts. Indeed, these contemporary geopolitical relations resemble a Shakespearean epic drama in their depth and breadth.

Announcing itself as a ""true history,"" yet, whose fictional devices clearly shine through, Don Quixote occupies the privileged space of first modern novel where, within its literary fabric(ations), a theory of the novel is devised. Our readings of Don Quixote examine how the classic novel inserts, parodies, and transforms all previous literary and non-literary discourses to ingeniously invent a new narrative form. To contextualize Cervantes and his literary-historic tradition, this seminar also explores questions of erotic and literary desire, the role of madness and mental health, empire and the circulation of material culture and material wealth, the Edenic narrative and ecologies of the natural world, censorship and the Inquisition, the status of representation and performance, translation, as well as the constructions of class, gender, race, and nation.

1829,202401,1,Music of Protest & Propaganda,"What does music bring to politics? What makes a song effective for protest versus propaganda? In countless political and social movements the world over, music has been a primary medium (and sometimes a target) of activism. This seminar asks students to interrogate music’s oft-celebrated role in political protests and propaganda, and also to challenge common understandings of these two arenas of communication. Focusing primarily on North America and (Post)socialist Europe but also drawing comparisons between and beyond these regions, it examines musical case studies from several periods of upheaval and activism, including the late 1960s, the early 1990s, and the past few years. Students learn to draw upon the methods and scholarship of several disciplines, and particularly those that inform the interdisciplinary field of ethnomusicology, in order to understand music’s varied roles in the social lives of those caught up in campaigns for change. The seminar introduces students to accessible music terminology, but no musical background is required for the course.",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

1871,202401,1,"Introduction to Russian & Soviet Music, 1800-1950","Through a blend of immersive listening assignments and reading materials this seminar invites an exploration of the world of Russian and Soviet music, with a particular focus on the genres and forms that have left a mark on the musical landscape. We listen and analyze excerpts from operas, suites, sonatas, concertos, symphonies, and other musical pieces to learn how the historical and musical contexts have shaped the evolution of these genres and forms in Russian and Soviet music. This seminar expects to go beyond a mere historical overview; it delves into the genealogy of Russian and Soviet musical traditions, connecting them with their Western counterparts. It suggests that Russian and Soviet composers not only absorbed the influences of European music but also reimagined musical structures, and crafted original texts that seamlessly wove together established canons and innovative concepts. Additionally, this seminar aligns music with the key themes of intellectual and political history in Russia and the Soviet Union. We analyze how the multifaceted relationship between nationalism and Orientalism, the debates between Slavophiles and Westernizers, and the challenges of and responses to modernity have left their mark on the musical expressions of the time. We examine the historical context where it holds particular significance: for example, in the case of Dmitry Shostakovich's 7th Symphony.",,STOECK 312 - Stoeckel Hall (renovated) 312,T 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""STOECK 312 - Stoeckel Hall (renovated) 312"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559930""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/96224/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.6,4.205882352941177,4.0,1,2.4,1,4.0,1,2.4,1,,1095,1239,,,,

An essential objective of the course is to introduce students to some of the ways in which the premodern Persian tradition thinks about itself. To that end, primary readings are supplemented with short extracts from works by medieval and early modern theorists, critics, philosophers, and literary historians; these texts supply concepts and skills that are indispensable for reading, appreciating, and researching Persian literature. Achieving a fine-grained view of the tradition from within illuminates our discussions as we consider the highly flexible functions of premodern Persian prose. Our texts consistently blur hard divisions between history and propaganda; between ethics and aesthetics; between acts of imagination and acts of state.

We somewhat prioritize the field of scene perception, where many fundamental questions about the nature of seeing and aspects of cognition arise prominently, and much of those questions remain open to this date. We draw upon readings and classroom discussions to find out where the literature stands, including behavioral, neural, and computational studies, all in the context of searching for a mechanistic, functional account of how the brain produces percepts and thoughts about objects, scenes, and people.",,WTS B39 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street B39,M 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""WTS B39 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street B39"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559919""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94803/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.0666666666666664,3.933333333333333,3.933333333333333,1,2.8666666666666667,1,3.933333333333333,1,2.8666666666666667,1,,1126,1270,,,,

1925,202401,1,Philosophy of Data Science,"Data-based algorithmic systems are increasingly taking the helm of decision-making processes that significantly affect our lives. These tools range from affecting the mundane online advertisements we are shown to the life-altering criminal justice verdicts we receive. In the past several years, many scholars, as well as activists, journalists, and policymakers, have begun to consider the various ways that the widespread adoption of these systems can lead to prickly social problems. Some of the challenges these systems bring, you’ve likely heard of: concerns about unfairness and discrimination; about privacy and surveillance. Others have received less popular attention but still bear on the preceding moral questions: When is it permissible to use statistical inferences to make decisions about individuals? What are the benefits and dangers of using certain social categories, e.g., racial categories, in data collection and eventual model-based decision-making? This seminar focuses on the ethical questions raised by the growing domain of ""data science."" Included under the umbrella term of ""data science,"" are the closely related topics of algorithmic and machine learning decision systems. By and large, data is the lifeblood of these various systems; the tools work (if they do) because of the troves of data from which they draw inferences. There is now much popular concern over what algorithms or artificial intelligence can do. But it is the data and the statistical inference capabilities that systems have when they have access to lots of data where most of the philosophically interesting action happens.",,PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207,TTh 11:35am-12:50pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559570""]],""Thursday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559570""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94640/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.3571428571428568,4.485714285714286,4.071428571428571,1,2.7142857142857144,1,4.071428571428571,1,2.7142857142857144,1,,1135,1279,,,,
1926,202401,1,Advanced Introduction to Aesthetics,"This course offers an introduction to philosophical aesthetics through a survey of the most important texts the field’s history. We begin with ancient philosophy, in particular Plato and Aristotle. Here, we focus on the question of the nature and value of the arts; their relationship to other branches of knowledge and human activity; and, finally, their ethical and political implications. Then we read 18th c. Enlightenment authors Hume and Kant, where our focus concerns the rationality of aesthetic judgments. In particular, we consider uniquely modern anxieties concerning ""the standard of taste."" Can our attitudes towards works of art credibly claim universality and objectivity? Or are they instead reflections of our own utterly contingent historical situation? Moving forward, we turn to the 19th century and consider approaches that, in some way, break with Enlightenment rationalism. We begin with Hegel's explicitly historicist and communitarian approach to aesthetics and the philosophy of art, focusing on his conception of the role of art in society, as well as his ""end of art"" thesis. We also consider the numerous currents of thought that flow into Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy: romantic irrationalism, aestheticism, pessimism, and philhellenism. When we finally turn to the 20th century, we pursue the afterlife of some of these questions, not only in philosophy but in theory and criticism. Some attention in this final unit to phenomenology and existentialism, Marxism, pragmatism, modernism in the arts, the crisis of representation, the arts and technology, and new artistic media like photography and film.",Prerequisite: one course in philosophy or instructor permission.  ,PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207,T 7pm-8:50pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""19:00"",""20:50"",""PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559570""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94647/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.1999999999999997,4.116666666666666,4.3,1,3.1,1,4.3,1,3.1,1,,1136,1280,,,,

ASU is a brilliant and challenging defense of libertarianism−the view in political philosophy that nothing more extensive than a minimal state is morally justified−and it is filled with original, witty, and thought-provoking arguments on a wide range of topics in moral and political philosophy (to list just a few: the nature of well-being, the basis of rights, the state of nature, animal ethics, property rights, free markets, distributive justice, the nature of coercion, self-defense, and what utopia might be like). The seminar is devoted to reading ASU in its entirety and evaluating its various arguments.

1929,202401,1,Liberal Capitalism and Social Justice,"Today, the predominant economic system that reigns globally is a capitalist one: one in which most goods and services are distributed via market exchange; most people earn their means of livelihood by selling their labor for a wage to purchase what they need on the market, because they cannot produce sufficiently on their own to survive, because other people (a small minority) own the means of production. What should we think about this social order? On one hand, capitalism generates myriad social pathologies, including the impoverishment of masses of people, the entrenchment of inequalities that vitiate against democratic values, the abasement of all value by the value of capitalist accumulation, the inexorable drive of resource extraction barreling toward ecological fallout, among others. On the other hand, capitalism has proved an unparalleled engine for growth, enabled a variety of new forms of participation in social life, and embodies a coherent moral framework based around rights of private ownership. All this suggests that a society ordered by capitalism is a proper subject of questions of justice. In this class, we ask these questions. (How) can a capitalist society be just? In what ways might it fall short?

Materialism and Religion in the Ancient and Modern World,"It's often presupposed that while belief in the supernatural—Gods, souls, the afterlife, magic—might well have been reasonable before the advent of modern science, now we know better. Yet it’s quite hard to pinpoint just what it is we know now that we didn’t know then which makes the crucial difference. Moreover, even before modern science, proto-naturalist philosophers were making arguments that don’t look all that dissimilar—or all that much weaker—from what’s available today. This class is co-taught by one instructor who's very open to supernatural beliefs, and another instructor who's much less so.

1980,202401,1,Introduction to Quantum Information Processing and Communication,"This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.","Familiarity with complex numbers and the basics of linear algebra (matrices, determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues) is assumed.

The second part of the course considers the history of the American university, its present-day mission, and the concept of academic freedom. In the final part of the course, we turn to campus speech. We consider such issues as barring controversial speakers from campus; the line between appropriate and inappropriate means of protest against such speakers; sanctions on faculty and students for speech in the classroom or in open spaces on campus that some students claim interfere with their equal educational opportunities; and sanctions on faculty and students for off campus speech, especially on the internet, allegedly impairing on-campus equal educational opportunities. In doing so, we focus on the extent to which the general free speech principles we studied in the first part of the course should apply at public colleges and universities via the First Amendment, and at private institutions of higher learning through adoption of such measures as the Chicago Principles https://freeexpression.uchicago.edu/.",,WLH 113 - William L.

We approach the topic chronologically–from the institutions set up in the 1770s in the arc of American history–and thematically–drawing on such concepts as order, institutional design, functionality, and rights developed by scholars of American political development.

This can provide policymakers at both the state and national levels to learn from states about what approaches to policy solutions may work better than others. Secondly, fifty different states (some such as California, Texas, and New York have gross state products bigger than most countries–in fact the CA economy ranks 5th in the world behind Germany and India, and Texas ranks 8th in the world) comprise a natural laboratory in which to observe and test questions about political institutions, representation, political behavior, policymaking, and public opinion, among other topics.

2045,202401,1,The Ethics and Politics of Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing at a rapid pace. Consequently, debates about its impact on the economy, our society, and our politics are in full swing, with both celebratory visions of a better future and doomsday scenarios in the mix. But what exactly do we talk about when we fear—or celebrate—AI’s consequences for our lives? This course proposes to apply a political theory lens to the study of the social and political impact of artificial intelligence. How does the emergence of AI systems affect fundamental liberal democratic values such as liberty, equality, justice, and accountability? And how can we best regulate the development of AI and its uses in line with these values? Through several case studies, we will consider the ethical and political implications of increasing algorithmic control and automated decision-making. We ask questions such as: Who is responsible when AI causes suffering? How can bias in algorithms be spotted and prevented? Can we have both privacy and technological innovation? And how do AI systems impact on our democracy? In considering these issues, students learn about foundational political theory concepts and reflect on how they can be leveraged to formulate regulation that maximizes the societal benefit of AI.",,LC 206 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 206 + 1,W 1:30pm-3:20pm + 1,"{""Wednesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 206 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 206"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95939/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.3125,4.638888888888889,4.5,1,3.1875,1,4.5,1,3.1875,1,,1182,1326,,,,
2046,202401,1,The English-Speaking Enlightenment,"Beginning in the first half of the seventeenth century, and lasting until the latter part of the eighteenth, the Enlightenment brought a sweeping reassessment of age-old beliefs about morality, religion, politics and the ends of human life. But the Enlightenment was not a single event. There were different streams of thought within it. The assumptions and implications of these different Enlightenments were at points quite distinct, even conflicting. In this seminar, we examine one of these Enlightenment centered in London, Edinburgh, and Philadelphia through a close reading of selected works by its leading figures: David Hume, Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Benjamin Franklin. The goal of the seminar is to identify points of difference and commonality among these writers, to explore the contours of the English-speaking Enlightenment as a distinctive intellectual tradition, and to examine its relevance today.",,SLB 110 - Sterling Law Buildings 110,W 1:10pm-3pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""13:10"",""15:00"",""SLB 110 - Sterling Law Buildings 110"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/531532""]]}",[],"[""Hu"",""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95811/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.0,4.766666666666667,4.8,1,3.8,1,4.8,1,3.8,1,,1183,1327,,,,
2047,202401,1,Politics Without Politicians,"In this lecture we engage in an exercise of political imagination. Specifically, I ask you to imagine with me what ""politics without politicians"" would look like. If power both corrupts and attracts the wrong kind of people, what would a better system than the electoral ones we are familiar with look like? Should ""politics without politicians"" mean rule by disinterested experts or rule by caring amateurs? If we assume that all of us, rather than an elite few, should rule, then how can we empower ordinary citizens without loss of competence? Building on a rich literature in political philosophy, history, political science, and literature, we consider all the ways in which ordinary citizens could be in charge under reconfigured political institutions. The English philosopher G.K. Chesterton wrote that ""All democracy really is an attempt (like that of a jolly hostess) to bring the shy people out."" We interrogate that quote and try to envision ways to empower the shy people among us, rather than the arrogant or power-hungry. We do so treading the line between ideal theory and what the philosopher John Rawls theorized as ""realistic utopia."" We scrutinize, in particular, the ideal of ""legislature by lot"" put forward by contemporary authors and inspired by the precedent of Classical Athens. We consider objections from competence, accountability and legitimacy to the rule of non-elected amateurs. We ask whether this vision of politics without politicians can travel to the governance of institutions like firms, hospitals, and schools, as well as larger, more diverse, and less wealthy countries than the Western examples that inspire it. Finally, we also explore the potential of digital technologies and artificial intelligence in helping us structure and scale democratic deliberation to the larger public and, possibly, the world.",,WLH 120 - William L.

2053,202401,1,Ethnic Conflict,"This course provides an introduction to the politics of human conflict—both violent and nonviolent—across countries and over time. We focus on inter-ethnic conflict and explore causes and possible cures of different types of conflict ranging from civil war and genocide, to racial bias, prejudice, and discrimination in everyday life. We ask how people make decisions in conflict situations (Why do they fight? Why do they discriminate against others?), what shapes the intensity of conflict across countries, and what interventions might be effective in promoting cooperation rather than conflict. How can societies torn apart by war be put together again? Can trust be regained after ethnic violence? Can ethnic bias and prejudice be reduced and how? We review prevalent theories from political science, psychology, and economics, and explore empirical methods to address these questions drawing on examples from different countries. This course synthesizes knowledge across several disciplines and exposes students to the social-scientific study of ethnic conflict, serving as a gateway to more specialized courses in comparative politics, international relations, and political economy. The course focuses on research design as well as on developing insights that can deepen students’ understanding of ethnic conflict and cooperation.",,RKZ 05 - Rosenkranz Hall 05,TTh 9am-10:15am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""9:00"",""10:15"",""RKZ 05 - Rosenkranz Hall 05"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559923""]],""Thursday"":[[""9:00"",""10:15"",""RKZ 05 - Rosenkranz Hall 05"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559923""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/96482/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,0.5,3.4166666666666665,3.25,1,2.75,1,3.25,1,2.75,1,,1189,1333,,,,
2054,202401,1,"Religion, Politics, and Identity in Asia","Asia is the world's most religiously and ethnically diverse continent today. Whether you are religious or not, you cannot understand Asia without understanding religion and its impact on the politics of individual and communal identities. This course serves as an introduction to the topic of religion, politics, and identity in Southeast and South Asia. This course explores the role of religion in the politics of ethnic identity, minority-majority conflict, conflict among ethnic minorities, nationalism, tribalism, state-building, militarism, and war. Our approach to religion is paradoxical: the role religion plays in the complexities of conflict and the role religion plays in the moral imagination of conflict resolution, reconciliation, and resistance. We examine why and how religion serves as a source of conflict and as a potential source of conflict resolution. In doing so, we also fill in some gaps by balancing the nuanced approaches to a deeper understanding of religious doctrines and lived experiences. Looking at these dynamics in Asia can also be applied to these kinds of ethnic conflicts elsewhere in the world, including in the US.",,WLH 202 - William L.

2073,202401,1,Drama as Resistance: From Neoliberalism to the Bolsonarism Crisis,"This course analyzes how a variety of theater plays from Brazil, Angola, Guinea Bissau, and Portugal articulate sociocultural, historical, discursive, musical, and aesthetic elements to oppose, ironize, resist, or dismantle structures of power or authoritarianism that subtly or violently oppress individual or collective emancipation/ imagination. We study how a variety of authors designed different destinies for the underrepresentation of women, undocumented people, working-class, Black people, and LGBTQIA+ by subverting, disclosing or decolonizing a set of beliefs (conscious or unconscious) that are still maintained by a capitalist neoliberalism in the form of gender, racial, and class violence. The study of plays also aims at promoting cooperative and action-oriented learning while enhancing transdisciplinary, intercultural and translingual competences. Students are invited to engage in practices with theatrical readings, production of clips, and an essay or video-essay. In the end, students have the opportunity to submit their production to be published in the Yale Portuguese Students’ Digital Magazine.

We then review biological systems that have been used by psychologists to make methodological and theoretical advances that include central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine, immune, gut-brain axis, and proteomics. In the systems review, we cover how biological systems operate and the dominant psychophysiologic theories that link those systems to psychological states.

This course is not a history of the concept of human nature, but rather a seminar in which students learn to analyze how the history of science and the history of thought have worked together to shape claims about the human’s most essential nature and develop their own positions on how scientific and humanistic thought work together. We ask: In response to which questions does the concept of the human’s nature arise? Why do science, religion, and philosophy feel like good places to look for answers? How do scholars’ interpretive methods shape the concepts of history, data, mind, and freedom that arise out of their studies of human nature?

2087,202401,1,Muslim Societies in Africa,"While the Western academy has long devoted attention to Africa and Islam, it has not commonly treated the two together. Their estrangement in the literature belies the significance of Islam in Africa and conversely of Africa within the wider Islamic World. Indeed, today Africans constitute nearly a third of the global Muslim community. Islam enjoys a rich history on the continent, stretching from the migration of Muslims to seventh-century Abyssinia to the Islamic kingdoms of nineteenth-century West Africa. This course seeks to reimagine Africa not as a periphery but as a center of the Islamic World. It relocates a model of Islam that looks to the Middle East, instead highlighting the diversity of practice, scholarship, and politics of Muslim societies in Africa. It explores how constructions of race inform the representation of Islam in Africa today. It also questions whether one can even speak of Islam in Africa at all, reexamining what is lost and what is gained in such a geography of African and Muslim subjects. Rather than a comprehensive overview, the course provides a solid foundation for engaging in key theoretical debates on issues of religion, race, and politics in Africa and the wider Islamic World.",,WLH 003 - William L.

2094,202401,1,"The Master and Margarita: Money, Sex, and Power in Stalin's Russia","Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita is the most popular Russian novel of the twentieth century. Its plot, which describes the Devil’s visit to Moscow in the 1930s, has no analogues in modern Russian literature: it mixes ingeniously the elements of adventure, romance, history, philosophy, fantasy, and satirical novels. Bulgakov worked on his magnum opus for twelve years, from 1928 and until his death in 1940. The novel, however, was not published until 1966, when the first section appeared in the magazine Moskva, which sold out within hours. For contemporary readers, Bulgakov’s text is a treasure trove of insight about society, culture, morality, economics, power, religion, entertainment, politics, police, and everyday life in the Stalin era. But Bulgakov also raises deep philosophical issues: the various chapters of The Master and Margarita are case studies dealing provocatively and in depth with the meaning of life and the fear of death, good and evil, love and loyalty, ethics and responsibility, and so much more. As a bonus, the final chapters offer us Bulgakov’s own recipe for happiness. During the semester, we dive into the intricacies of Bulgakov's narrative, studying not only the structure, content, and characters of the novel, but also—through some visual sources and scholarly articles—the history of Stalinist Moscow, and the textual sources that permeate the book, from the Bible, Goethe’s Faust, and Dante’s The Divine Comedy, to Gogol and Pushkin, to Bulgakov's fellow writers and philosophers.",,HQ 227 - Humanities Quadrangle 227,TTh 11:35am-12:50pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""HQ 227 - Humanities Quadrangle 227"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]],""Thursday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""HQ 227 - Humanities Quadrangle 227"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}","[""WR""]","[""Hu"",""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95016/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.8492647058823533,4.205882352941177,4.411764705882353,1,2.5625,1,4.411764705882353,1,2.5625,1,,1226,1372,,,,
2095,202401,1,The Invention of Tradition in Post-Soviet Nation States,"The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in a number of independent countries that had never been countries before, or not for several centuries. In the ensuing decades politicians, historians, and culture makers in each of these countries produced narratives that claim a separate national identity and chart its history over a long stretch of time though in many instances the country as a geopolitical unit was a Soviet fabrication. The course looks at the countries of Central Asia, Russia, and Ukraine. It discusses how each of the countries covered has generated revised accounts of the past that disaggregate ethnic, linguistic, or cultural imbrications with neighboring countries.  It also considers the after effects of empire in this process.

2140,202401,1,Sociology of Emotion,"How are personal emotions made socially? While perceived to be the most private aspect of human life, emotions are at the heart of the social world. Take ""Climate Emotions"" or ""Eco-anxiety."" How can a global problem become a deeply personal issue? How do we suffer social problems individually? Taking inspiration from this seeming paradox, this course applies a sociological lens to understand how emotions are made at the intersection of the individual and social life. In order to unpack the process, first we equip ourselves with theoretical tools, learning how different sociologists approach emotions from critical, interactionist, and cultural lenses. Then, we apply these paradigms to two related domains: political life and mental health, which helps us connect micro-level analyses to macro-dynamics. In politics, we look at populist emotions, social movements, and nostalgia. We study how nationalist emotions are built cognitively, and why political emotions can be divisive as well as bridging. With mental health, we think about therapy sociologically and question why mental health problems are on the rise. We historicize sociology’s treatment of the subject: a move from approaching treatment facilities as total institutions to seeing therapy as a tool of civil repair. We theorize the benefits of destigmatizing therapy and ask if therapy can liberate us from social problems. Within this context, we meditate on the Mindfulness Movement.",,WLH 204 - William L.

2141,202401,1,"Prison Nation, Race, Gender, Crime, and Abolition Politics","Mass incarceration is one of the most pressing social problems of the 21st century. The U.S. has one of the highest rates of incarceration of any nation in the world, despite violent crime rates declining over the past few decades while the number of individuals who have spent time behind bars has increased. This has combined with an increase in the number of prisons and rehabilitation centers that have been built across the country, and corporations associated with the punishment industry have made extreme profits from this growth in the prison industrial complex. The impact of this prison nation is broad reaching but has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. This course examines why there has been such a rapid increase in incarceration and prisons across the United States and why people have allowed for this increase over the past several decades. We interrogate how U.S. social control practices are intertwined with racialized and gendered bodies. Throughout the course we discuss efforts to transform our penal system through anti-violence movements, prison abolition, reproductive justice and grassroots organizing particularly within communities of color and LGBTQ circles.",This course is not open to students previously enrolled in SOCY 105/WGSS 106.,WTS B60 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street B60,MW 1pm-2:15pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""WTS B60 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street B60"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559919""]],""Wednesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:15"",""WTS B60 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street B60"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559919""]]}",[],"[""So""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95091/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.6363636363636367,4.7272727272727275,4.7272727272727275,1,3.090909090909091,1,4.7272727272727275,1,3.090909090909091,1,,1271,1417,,,,
2142,202401,1,Education in the Globalizing City,"Global cities are often celebrated as hubs of technological innovation, international trade and finance, extraordinary diversity, cosmopolitan culture, and economic growth. Yet, despite the idealism that surrounds them, global cities are also known to be highly unequal places where concentrations of wealth and opulence exist alongside extreme levels of poverty and disadvantage. This contradiction serves as the broader lens through which this course explores education in the North American globalizing city. We begin by examining how the global city is imagined, both as a sociological concept and an aspirational goal of policymakers and city planners. We then turn to an overview of major historical and contemporary issues in urban education. Having established these foundations, we direct our focus to selected qualitative sociological studies that explore the intersections of education policy, schooling practices and experiences, and youth culture as they play out in different globalizing urban contexts that include Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver. Specific themes include urban revitalization policies, gentrification, urban school reforms, race and ethnic relations, educational inequality, and youth cultural formations.",,LC 209 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 209,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 209 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 209"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95658/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,No regular final examination,False,False,False,1.3999999999999995,4.6,4.6,1,3.2,1,4.6,1,3.2,1,,1272,1418,,,,

Which techniques are common across disciplines? And how might a theater artist learn about creative pursuits from artists in other disciplines including music, design, and fiction as well as theater?

This class introduces students to the intersections between dance and politics in 20th/21st century United States and its migratory spheres. Students watch filmed performance and attend live shows to understand how dancers use embodiment to make arguments, enact cultural diplomacy, and shift the grounds of activism. We analyze how our society has made meaning out of dancing bodies that move across stages, dance clubs, and film screens. We use movement analysis and choreography as a lens to understand strategies of organizing and protest. Focusing mainly on new trends in Dance Studies, we center queer theory, performance theory, critical race theory, and transnational history methodologies. By the end of the semester, students are equipped to identify key moments in American concert dance and social dance history, as well as their relation to broader political moments and social movements for class equality and racial/gender/sexual liberation, develop the descriptive and analytical tools to write about movement-based performance, design and create their own work of dance ethnography.",,YK220 001 - 220 York Street 001,W 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""YK220 001 - 220 York Street 001"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563696""]]}",[],"[""Hu""]",1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95602/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,HTBA,False,False,False,1.714285714285714,4.285714285714286,4.571428571428571,1,2.857142857142857,1,4.571428571428571,1,2.857142857142857,1,,1304,1466,,,,

2215,202401,1,Directed Independent Study,"An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, THST 491, even when not undertaken by a senior.

The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period. An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser.

This Urban Lab explores the food system through its many points of interaction with city government and the built environment. Engaging locally with food policy in and around New Haven, this Urban Lab embraces the illegible aspects of cities and resists looking at the city as a fixed concept. Rather, we approach the city as a site of ongoing processes–citymaking and policymaking as iterative, contested, and multi-sectoral practices playing out over generations and across political administrations. Beyond the local food system, we also look at global trends and Federal-level policies in food policy.

2252,202401,1,What Is An Archive?,"This graduate seminar seeks to answer the question in the course’s title by looking closely at professional archival descriptive practices and broader, looser uses of the term in cultural and literary studies, art history, history, and beyond. By looking at these distinct but curiously, even suspiciously, concurrent genealogies, we seek to explain why the term ""archive"" has become so demonstrably popular, in multiple senses of the word, even as archival practice has become more professionalized and specialized. Put differently, many humanistic fields have undergone ""archival turns"" in recent decades, and many cultural and performance theorists, critics, and historians have advanced arguments about ""the archive"" as a monolithic concept, perhaps ""the archives"" as an abstract location where the work begins (e.g., ""I’ve been in the archives""), or perhaps ""my archive"" as the group of texts I interpret and cite. Meanwhile, professional archivists regularly publish tweets, articles, and blog posts asking them to stop it. This course hopes to ponder and maybe even find a way toward an answer to the question: What is up with this? We explore archives in theory and practice, as both figurative and literal, both concrete and abstract, repositories for ""primary"" inquiry into the past. We consider theories of archives from humanities fields and the archival profession (including the emerging subfield ""critical archival studies""), and we discuss how archives are made, how they are used, how they are made usable, what may be assumed or elided in the making and use of archives, and the popularity of, and tensions around, ""the archive"" as a concept. Topics and keywords include: what is primary or original? What is order or process? What is a trace, and how is it made distinct from the great mass of human traces? What does it mean to collect, to curate? What is an archival silence, and what might be comparable notions of archival noise? What does it mean to recover or discover? In addition to readings, students complete two assignments: a provenance research assignment and a descriptive project in the form of a survey of an existing collection at Yale or a subject guide to a collection or group of collections.",,HQ 225 - Humanities Quadrangle 225,M 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""HQ 225 - Humanities Quadrangle 225"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94608/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.0,4.5,4.5,1,3.5,1,4.5,1,3.5,1,,1350,1513,,,,

2261,202401,1,Black Existentialisms,"This course is an introduction to Black existential thought as it developed in the writing of African American and Afro-Caribbean authors. Existentialism was a historical movement in philosophy and culture typically associated with mid-twentieth-century European intellectuals that asked how individuals constitute themselves within and beyond the given constraints of and possibilities of their situation. But a deep tradition of Black existentialism—or what Lewis R. Gordon calls Africana philosophies of existence—is related to but distinct from the European tradition. Throughout the course we explore key existential concepts such as freedom, authenticity, responsibility, action, struggle, situation, anguish, dread, the gaze, and the Other as they have been imagined in Black diasporic expressive cultures. Some of the questions we ask include: How have Black writers developed existential ideas in novels, poetry, and drama? How does the encounter between European and Africana existentialisms animate the literature of Black freedom struggles in the US and across the colonial and postcolonial world? How does Black existentialism understand the (im)possibility of self-making within a society structured by dominance, and what might an existentialist understanding of Black collectivity look like? How can Black existential thought provide productive opportunities to reevaluate some of the seeming binaries that have shaped conversations in Black studies (in the mid-twentieth century and again today) such as hope/despair, being/nonbeing, humanism/antihumanism, and social life/social death? Why Black existentialism, and why now? Readings include work by Frantz Fanon, Richard Wright, Lorraine Hansberry, Ann Petry, William Melvin Kelley, George Lamming, Jackie Sibblies Drury, Ralph Ellison, Lewis R. Gordon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and others.

The course considers conversion, pathologies and pathways to hope, storytelling and epistemology, the miraculous as spiritual power dynamics, sermons and prayer as dialectics of hope, the paradox of spontaneity and tradition in oral worship, the mediation of identity through aesthetics, the pragmatism of public engagement, communality and leadership, and the Pentecostal vision within African religion.

After 1966, the French military detonated 193 more atomic and hydrogen bombs on the living inhabitants of the occupied Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean. Today, more than 70 percent of French energy supply is fueled by nuclear power that depends entirely on highly radioactive uranium extraction infrastructures located predominantly in African lands formerly colonized by France. The imperial radiance of France leaves an enduring toxic legacy whose impact is not yet known. Our planet is materially haunted on a cellular and atomic level by the slow violence of nuclear imperialism that nation-states train us not to perceive.

Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.",Instructor permission required.,TBA,TBA,{},[],[],1.0,,,,CANCELLED,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1374,1537,,,,
2278,202401,1,War and Everyday Life,"This course thinks together two spatiotemporal phenomena that appear opposed: war and everyday life. Why is war generally thought of as an exceptional phenomenon, a climactic event that disrupts the quotidian rhythms of the everyday? And why does everyday life so often appear parceled off from war, a placid domestic realm that soldiers depart from and return to? The study of war is often a masculine, muscular endeavor. This course's turn to the methodologies that are guided by feminist, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist critique allows us to better contemplate how militaristic logics shape everyday life and how anti-militarism might be lived at the level of daily practices. This notion of everyday militarisms is both the impetus and the frame for our engagement of the special collections at Yale Library. As an impetus, lived experience of militarism requires us to account for our specific institutional location. What has Yale's role been in war-making and empire-building? How might we analyze our own experiences at Yale and in the historical present with these flashpoints in mind? An attunement to the more quotidian aspects of militarisms also provides an alternate frame for rethinking wartime events that may at the outset seem extraordinary or exceptional. What might it mean to understand nuclear bombs, forced migrations, and environmental disasters as ordinary crises? What do people's day-to-day experience of such crises look like? To approach such questions from different angles and at different scales, we need to consult primary source materials in tandem with an array of interdisciplinary scholarship. Considered together, these course materials help us contemplate why everyday wars tend to go undetected—whether because of new kinds of weapons, war crimes that pass as governance, the time lag of slow violence, or the representational norms of popular culture. Of course, the militarization of daily life looks different depending on one’s geographical, historical, social, and disciplinary orientation. So, even though the course tries to assemble a range of materials and examples, it reflects the instructor's orientation as an Americanist scholar of twentieth-century transpacific culture and politics. But the assessment of everydayness is a matter of perception and perspective in a more general sense as well. How does militarism hide in plain sight, and for whom is it hidden? Throughout the term, the power relations embedded in discerning and analyzing everyday militarisms require us to bring an added layer of critical self-reflection to all our research endeavors.",,LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319,M 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Monday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93926/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.5,4.0625,4.5,1,3.0,1,4.5,1,3.0,1,,1375,1538,,,,

How do we as anthropologists give meanings to the world out there that is so intertwined and complex beneath what we see and hear? How do we see what seems invisible and how to listen to silence? How do we account for our own implication in the encounters through which we experience and learn, and reflect upon? How do we weave stories through writing?

The course then reviews a variety of methods that scholars may use to reconstruct ancient beliefs and rituals. The course assesses the applicability and success of these methodologies across the broad spectrum of ancient cultures representing differing degrees of sociopolitical complexity.

2346,202401,1,"Beauty, Wonder & Awe","This seminar explores the role of beauty, wonder, and awe in the design and experience of our world. For most of the 20th century, these subjects were either entirely ignored in academia, or worse, cast exclusively as nefarious mechanisms of control used only by those in power. And yet who among us has not been uplifted by a scene in a film, a piece of music, an object, a work of art or architecture—or perhaps even something as unassuming as a beautifully cascading pile of laundry? This course will work under the assumption that such positive human experiences are needed more now than ever in a world increasingly defined by pessimism, criticism, and division. As such we will work under the assumption that beauty, wonder, and awe exist, and that they are worthy of a contemporary re-assessment, especially in the context of creative practices that are interested in producing a more equitable, beautiful, and just human future. Through both philosophical and popular readings, the study of physical objects, and engaged discussion and lively debate, we will examine beauty, awe, and wonder from all possible angles- what they mean today, their history, why they are desired, how they might be produced, the motivations of those that promote them, and how they are being reconsidered not as the nefarious enemies of function or equality, but rather essential and ethically significant aspects of human experience. In order to address these subjects beyond an abstract academic setting, we will have visitors from various creative industries come to class to discuss these subjects relative to their own work and disciplines- including Jessica Diehl, the former creative director of Vanity Fair magazine, and Michael Young, a practicing architect deeply engaged with the subjects of aesthetics and representation. Students in the course will also (pending confirmation) visit New York City to explore and discuss these subjects at multiple scales, live and in person with the instructor, by viewing everything from architectural facades and urban monuments to medieval armor and Faberge eggs. This course will resist the inherited lore of academia that casts beauty, wonder, and awe only elitist or oppressive, in favor of asking how they can be better understood and incorporated into the design of a more humane world. In doing so we will explore the work of contemporary thinkers who offer nourishment to this endeavor including but not limited to Elaine Scarry, Jane Bennett, Timothy Morton, bell hooks, Nick Zangwill, Dacher Keltner, Georgio Agamben, Susan Magsamen, and others, including recent writings on aesthetics by the course instructor.

Through a term-long process of collaborative research, analysis, design, and technical documentation, student teams examine the specific relationship of the human body to its environment, the elemental concerns of inhabitation, and the physical, spatial, and technical formation of building. A series of iterative analytical exercises, conducted at a range of scales using various analytical tools and design media, address the building site, its enclosure, apertures, interior surfaces, and its fixtures and fittings, and their roles in mediating our experience of private and social space, of weather, and of climate. This collaborative process begins at the start of the term with the formation of design teams and the introduction of our Building Project partners: our clients at Columbus House of New Haven, a New Haven-based shelter and permanent supportive housing provider for the homeless, and the New Haven city officials who administer the city’s zoning, building, and life-safety laws and regulations under the auspices of New Haven’s Livable City Initiative. Over the course of the term and in conjunction with a series of lectures, field trips, and workshops, each student team develops and documents a distinct and technically detailed design proposal for a two-family house, one of which is selected at the end of the term. This work sets the stage for the second phase of the course and the subsequent work of the summer: the construction of the Jim Vlock Building Project house in New Haven’s Hill neighborhood.",,TBA,TF 2pm-6pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""14:00"",""18:00"","""",""""]],""Friday"":[[""14:00"",""18:00"","""",""""]]}",[],[],0.0,,,,ACTIVE,,"Architecture courses will be open for registration on January 15, 2024 with limited seats.

Computational machines, tools once considered only more efficient versions of paper-based media, have a demonstrated potential beyond mere imitation. This potential is revealed through design computation, the creative application of the processes and reasoning underlying all digital technology, from email to artificial intelligence. Just as geometry is fundamental to drawing, computation affords a fundamental understanding of how data works, which is essential to advance the development of BIM, performative design, and other emerging methodologies. This seminar introduces design computation as a means to enable architects to operate exempt from limitations of generalized commercial software; to devise problem-specific tools, techniques, and workflows; to control the growing complexities of contemporary architectural design; and to explore forms generated only by computation itself. Topics include data manipulation and translation, algorithms, information visualization, computational geometry, human-computer interaction, custom tooling, generative form-finding, emergent behavior, simulation, and system modeling.

2362,202401,1,Exploring New Values of Design Practice,"How do we make design a more profitable practice? Design business has traditionally positioned building as a commodity in the delivery supply chain, valued by clients like other products and services purchased at lowest first cost. Despite the fact that the building sector in its entirety operates in large capital pools where significant value is created, intense market competition, sole focus on differentiation by design quality, and lack of innovation in project delivery and business models have resulted in a profession that is grossly underpaid and marginally profitable. The profession must explore new techniques for correlating the real value of an architect’s services to clients and thereby break the downward pressure on design compensation. This seminar redesigns the value proposition of architecture practice, explores strategies used by better-compensated adjacent professions and markets, and investigates methods by which architects can deliver—and be paid for—the value they bring to the building industry.

2364,202401,1,The Architect As: Recasting the Role of the Architect in the Development Lifecycle,"An introduction to the real estate development lifecycle through the lens of the Architect. The course follows the typical chronology of a multi-family residential project starting from a developer's initial interest in a site, to a resident inhabiting the completed building; in between, it addresses feasibility, acquisitions, zoning, financing, design, construction, marketing and branding, and operations. We will employ this linear framework first to understand the underlying components of each phase, and second to evaluate: what is the role of the Architect - past versus present, real versus perceived? Where the Architect’s role has been eroded or altered over time, how can they rebuild it - leveraging their multifaceted skillset or learning new modes of analysis - to maximize agency and impact? Finally, we will ask broader questions that cut across the development lifecycle: what does an enhanced Architect mean for the other players along the value chain? What does it mean for the ability of the Architect to impact development strategy, or to frame development as a series of design challenges? How does the dynamic between form and finance, design and development change? And, what does the rebuilt Architect mean for the final product – the realized building – and the built environment? The seminar examines traditional and hybrid design practices through readings, assignments, and guest lectures.

2384,202401,1,Feral Surfaces and Multi-species Architecture: Rethinking Posthuman Territory,"This seminar examines the concepts and buildings that characterize the discourse on posthuman architecture over the past decade, asking whether architecture as a discipline has demonstrated a capacity to move away from its 500 years of anthropocentrism. A controversial term since its inception in the 1970s, the term ""posthuman"" is widely used to refer to work that embraces non-humans, from machines to multiple species. It is a term that is also criticized for its failure to acknowledge its racialized undertones within the environmental discourse. Other terms that address posthuman architectural programs include non-human, animal, multi-species, and feral: terms whose capacity to describe an inclusive and biodiverse approach to architecture we explore. The trajectory of the term is dedicated to mapping the new landscape of architecture for multiple species in projects and texts. The bulk of the seminar is devoted to describing the reality of building for multiple species and focuses on developing wall sections through LIDAR-based digital twins of case study buildings. We analyze built work that manifests the hybrid entanglement envisioned by posthumanism, but more critically, we interrogate its facture: how is the analogous habitat constructed? How is duration, maintenance, and other time-based process inscribed in building cladding? How do you represent scales that are typically too small for human consideration? The course is conceived as a workshop-style seminar in which students develop research, writing, and analysis of existing examples of multi-species architecture. The framework for this questioning will be provided by literature reviews and case studies in which students develop a familiarity with LIDAR scanning, point-cloud models, and their manipulation in Rhino and Revit. Time-based analysis integrates data from sensors. Our hypothesis is that the digital twin, and recent speculation on the digital twin city, harbors new potential for fostering biodiversity support as feral surfaces for the city. This research is envisioned within the framework of a new publication, building on my 2013 Routledge anthology Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory. In the short term, students build research skills and cultivate critical thinking, while in the long-term students establish a habit of design that seeks space for multiple species in contemporary architecture.",,RDH 322 - Rudolph Hall 322,W 9am-10:50am,"{""Wednesday"":[[""9:00"",""10:50"",""RDH 322 - Rudolph Hall 322"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559534""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95726/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Architecture courses will be open for registration on January 15, 2024 with limited seats.

Topics of discussion include the history of the castle in British architecture and landscape architecture; Italian and French influences on the seventeenth-century British garden; military landscaping; the Palladian country house and British agricultural landscape; Capability Brown’s landscape parks; theories of the picturesque and of the landscape sublime; Romanticism and the psychology of nature; the creation of the public park system; arts and crafts landscape design; and the beginnings of landscape modernism. Comparisons of historical material with contemporary landscape design, where appropriate, are made throughout the term.

2388,202401,1,Labs and Landscapes of the Green Revolution,"In 1968, the director of the US Agency for International Development, William Gaud, christened the decades-long experiments with agriculture and technology as the ""green revolution."" Juxtaposing it with the Red Revolution of the USSR and the White Revolution of the Shah of Iran, record harvests during the Cold War made the Green Revolution as much about food and hunger as it did geopolitics and diplomacy. This seminar explores the origins and development of the Green Revolution through its principal sites of experimentation: laboratories and landscapes. Whether hailed by some as a major turning point in the history of combatting hunger and food insecurity or castigated by others for perpetuating colonial and imperial asymmetries of power and environmental degradation, the legacies of the Green Revolution endure to this day. We attend to the global legacies of this color-coded revolution and how it reshaped the contours of the land, food distribution networks, settlement patterns, and cultures of eating and cooking, as well as reconfigured the habits and habitats of the human subject. Along with weekly readings and assignments that involve eating and cooking, we travel to one of the major laboratories and landscapes of the Green Revolution: India.",,RDH 706 - Rudolph Hall 706,M 11am-12:50pm,"{""Monday"":[[""11:00"",""12:50"",""RDH 706 - Rudolph Hall 706"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559534""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95730/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Architecture courses will be open for registration on January 15, 2024 with limited seats.

2389,202401,1,The (Built) Environment: environmental design and urban transformation in practice,"Over the next decade, cities and human settlements will remain a critical lever for addressing the climate crisis and ecological collapse. Contemporary urbanization differs from historical patterns of urban growth in its scale and rate of global change, touching on such dimensions as food and agriculture, land use, biodiversity, water, energy, governance, and more. Large-scale urban expansion of new and growing cities as well as continued development of established cities present opportunities for a new conceptualization of the built environment in the context of sustainability. As cities dominate the globe, the intersection between architecture and environmental action must be redefined. This course is designed for students who seek new terrain for architectural thought within the context of evolving environmental challenges. The course is run as a colloquium and workshop. Invited guests forging new work in the built environment will share not only their current research and practice but also their methods of work. Student-moderated discussions with our guests will present the opportunity for students to build the skills to critically position themselves within the discourse of urbanization, architecture, and environmental action. Concurrently, students will workshop individual or group projects operating at the intersection of the built and natural environments resulting in a project proposal of each student’s choosing. In the short-term, students will build research skills and cultivate critical thinking. In the long-term, students will build the foundations for their future professional / academic trajectory by forging new methods of practice or research in urbanization and architecture. Students from all programs are encouraged to enroll and no design work is required. Projects can be historical, analytical, speculative, policy-oriented, etc. The only requirements is for the proposed project to interrogate the intersection between the built and natural environments and open new avenues for cross-disciplinary work about built form as a critical lever for global sustainability.",,LORIA 360 - Loria Center 360,Th 11am-12:50pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""11:00"",""12:50"",""LORIA 360 - Loria Center 360"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95731/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Architecture courses will be open for registration on January 15, 2024 with limited seats.

The psychophysical dimensions of color have been continually debated, reinvented, structured, codified, mystified, and systematized. The term color space refers to a range of color mapped by a system, such as RGB or CMYK. But, long before these models were used to describe color on screen or paper, artists were utilizing systems to organize color in their work. Hue, value, saturation, and surface are all relative components artists use to structure color in specific ways. In this course we explore the space of color, from its visual and psychological qualities to its relationship to language and culture. Through assignments and critiques, students experiment with different approaches to using color in their own work.

With a sensitivity to the intrinsic and poetic ability of materials to convey meaning, students conduct individualized research with the assistance of their instructor, classmates, and visiting experts to investigate recurring challenges in their practice and develop innovations in their approach to making.

This course explores the duality of representation understood, on the one hand, as aesthetics (depiction, picturing) and, on the other, as politics (standing in, speaking for), and the constant slippage between the two in the making and interpretation of a work of art. We assume identity as an always ambivalent negotiation of sameness and difference, belonging and alienation, continuity and discontinuity between a collective sociality and a singular becoming. Against identity as a form of enclosure, a central project of the course—guided by students’ own questions, media, methods, and practices—is thus to investigate and invent other forms, and formal problems, that the desire and endeavor to ""represent"" difference can take. Texts drawn from art history and criticism, poetics, philosophy, cultural studies, psychoanalysis, and new media theory introduces alternative strategies for thinking about difference as a motor of meaning and vital intervention intrinsic to an artwork’s politics and aesthetics—or its work as and beyond representation.",,GREEN C220 - Green Hall (1156 Chapel) C220,Th 10am-1pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""10:00"",""13:00"",""GREEN C220 - Green Hall (1156 Chapel) C220"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560064""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93389/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Permission of instructor required; interested students should submit to the Instructor Permission Request Form in Yale Hub by Monday, November 27 for prime consideration.",,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1483,1662,,,,

Finally, we address artistic projects—in the form of performances, curation, and more—that constitute institutional critique as a means of thinking about shortcomings, prejudices, and the ongoing need for expanding the scope of cannon as well as the protagonists behind the shows that we encounter today.

2428,202401,1,The Artist as Curator,"This course provides an overview of artists who as ""curators"" have lent or lend to the rethinking of conventional forms of exhibition making. Their artistic investigations constitute artist practice as a field of inquiry that extends beyond the production of objects of various media to interstitial approaches that reflect the artist’s engagement with art history, philosophy, anthropology, politics, activism—the world and universe at large. The Artist as Curator addresses the meta framework for the creation and artist experience in reclaiming research and life practices that are all too often deemed peripheral as to an artist’s process as legitimate to the consideration of the art work. Since the development of curatorial studies graduate programs (M.A. Curating) in United States and international institutions in the late 1980s, the role of the curator has been professionalized as an external exhibition choreographer, conceptualizer, organizer, and interpreter of the artist’s process. This mediation has privileged this external curatorial voice and yet, it has side tracked the relationship(s) the artist has to/with a particular set of conditions and communities. that makes art possible. This course encourages students to recognize the wider set of practices they defer to in an effort to convey a picture of what is it to ""work"" and ""think"" through one’s practice that recognizes ambivalence, investigation, options, fluctuation, divergence, and the engagement of other fields of knowledge to enrich one’s perspective and vocabulary with respect to practice. The course navigates through historical and contemporary cases and contexts—to include, but not be limited to, dialogue between Duchamp and Picabia, Asger Jorn and Jacqueline de Jong (The Situationist Enclave), the early initiatives of Claes Oldenburg (Ray Gun Theatre), Jonas Mekas (Anthology Film Archive), Trisha Brown (The Judson Theatre and the Grand. Union), Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica (Tropicalia), Tucuman Arde, Vivian Brown (Where We At), David Hammons, Rene Gabri and Ayreen Anastas (16 Beaver Group), RAQs Media Collective among others—to provide an overview of artists who engage and enlarge communities and audiences in tandem with generating alternative formats for the participatory experience. The course also addresses the changing institutional conditions that, over time, have contributed to the changing ways in which artists intervene as institutional actors/curators  by looking at the projects of: Amy Silman (Re-reading the MoMA collection); Carol Bove (Harry Smith at the Whitney); and, more recently, Sohrad Mohebbi and the 58th Carnegie International.

2451,202401,1,Advanced Topics in Causal Inference Methods,"The evaluation of a public policy program designed to improve the health and well-being of a population requires the use of statistical methods for the estimation of its effects and the knowledge of causal inference tools to attribute the estimated effects to our intervention of interest. When studies are not well designed, several complications may arise. This course covers advanced topics of causal inference in complex settings, known as ""irregular designs,"" where the common assumptions required for the estimation of causal effects do not hold. Irregular designs include randomized experiments affected by non-compliance, censoring or missing outcomes, and observational studies with unmeasured confounders. We also learn how to deal with other irregular designs, including panel studies with time-invariant unmeasured confounders and regression discontinuity designs where the treatment is assigned based on a cut-off rule on test scores or poverty indexes and hence is affected by the lack of overlap. The second part of the course focuses on ways to go beyond the treatment effect and investigate all the mechanisms that come into play when the intervention is implemented: causal pathways, spillover effects, and heterogeneity. A better understanding of these mechanisms can help us improve the design of our intervention. We first learn statistical methods to disentangle causal pathways through which the intervention has an effect. We then relax the common assumption of independence between units and allow the treatment of one unit to affect the outcome of other units. We present cutting-edge statistical methods to estimate spillover or peer-influence effects in clusters of units or in social networks. The last part of the course deals with identification of heterogeneous treatment effects using standard and machine-learning approaches. Identifying subgroups of individuals for whom the effect is more beneficial can help us design optimal and cost-effective treatment strategies where the treatment is assigned to specific individuals. The course is complemented with interesting examples from the social and health sciences.","Prerequisites: S&DS 542 (or S&DS 612) and BIS 623 (or S&DS 612), or waivers for these courses; BIS 679 (or BIS 557), or a waiver for this course; and BIS 537, or exposure in other courses to fundamental concepts of causal inference.

Variability in biomarker performance and susceptibility to disease due to ageing, diet, location, and other factors is discussed, along with methods that are used to evaluate biomarker evidence in epidemiology. Lectures describe chronic noncommunicable diseases of immediate concern to public health such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease), cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and asthma. We examine seminal publications and the application of techniques that have transformed the understanding of each disease, resulting in improvements to early detection and treatment approaches for these diseases. We also delve into examples of epidemiologic studies that have been carried out on large prospective cohorts, such as the Framingham Heart Study and Nurses’ Health Study, and compare and critique methods used to identify biomarkers of disease between the cohorts.

2518,202401,1,Resonant and Non-Resonant Interaction of Light with Matter,"This course considers the interaction of light with individual molecules and collections of molecules in solutions and solids from the perspective of a classical radiation field interacting with the energy levels that arise from quantized motions. We begin with the generation of light by accelerated charges as described by Maxwell’s equations for the electric and magnetic fields. We then consider the polarization states of light, how the oscillating electric field drives the motions of electrons, and how this results in scattering when off-resonant and then evolves into shifts in level populations as the frequency approaches that of the eigenenergies between levels. Classical analogies to quantum mechanical behavior are stressed in the context of the damped-driven electron in a harmonic potential (the so-called Drude model). The kinetics of absorption and emission are discussed in the context of the Einstein treatment that leads to light amplification and laser action. Finally, we develop the ""selection rules"" that describe what transitions can occur depending on the light polarization and the character of the electronic and nuclear motions.",Prerequisite: an upper-level undergraduate physics course in electricity and magnetism or CHEM 576.,SCL 18 - Sterling Chemistry Laboratory 18,MW 11:35am-12:50pm,"{""Monday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""SCL 18 - Sterling Chemistry Laboratory 18"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559572""]],""Wednesday"":[[""11:35"",""12:50"",""SCL 18 - Sterling Chemistry Laboratory 18"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559572""]]}",[],[],0.5,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93362/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Please note, that this course is offered in the second half of the term and meets from Thurs.

The seminar explores the nature of the categories and classificatory systems that structure our understanding of the art of the ancient world. How do labels and nomenclature determine categories? How do modern categories compare to ancient ones? We seek answers to these and related questions and examine the primary categories that shape the study of the art of antiquity such as period, style, and iconography. Students gain familiarity with some modern theories of classification alongside ancient and modern modes of categorizing ancient Greek art, architecture, and material culture from the rise of the Greek polis (ca. 700 BCE) to Late Antiquity.

2634,202401,1,"Contemporary Marxist and Postcolonial Cultural Theory, 1989–Present","An introduction to a selection of key late-twentieth and twenty-first century Marxist and left postcolonial theorists and texts focusing on historical and intellectual exchanges between these critical formations. After the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1989, Marxism and Marxist theory seemed to many to have lost social relevance. Similarly, new debates on ""world literature"" were taken by some to mark the waning of an earlier more politicized ""postcolonial studies."" However, as the Western triumphalism of the post–1989 years receded in the face of multiple international challenges—notably, climate catastrophe, the 2008 financial crisis, increasingly wealth inequality and oligarchic rule, challenges to American unilateralism—Marxist and postcolonial cultural theory have not simply persisted but enjoyed wide new readerships. Focusing on questions of literature and culture in these contexts, this seminar tracks some key debates and influential lines of scholarly development in these fields in the conjuncture between 1989 and the present. Writers discussed may include Perry Anderson, Fredric Jameson, Slavov Žižek, Immanuel Wallerstein, Giovanni Arrighi, Edward Said, Franco Moretti, Pascale Casanova, Katerina Clark, Monica Popescu, Sarah Brouillette, Sianne Ngai, Hal Foster, Peter and Christina Bürger, Jasper Bernes, Peter Osborne, Julian Stallabrass, Rob Nixon, and others.",,LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93934/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,-0.125,4.3173076923076925,4.25,1,4.375,1,4.25,1,4.375,1,,1607,1888,,,,

2636,202401,1,"Taking Leave: Meditations on Art, Death, and the Afterlife from the Bible to the Twentieth Century","This seminar seeks to contextualize leave-taking within the explicitly religious and artistic contexts of Western culture. We open with readings from ancient texts from Mesopotamian, Greek, Latin, and Judaic cultures, and end with the U.S. Civil War. And in between we spend considerable time on the ways in which the advent of Christianity and, in turn, the Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and modern worlds influenced the practices and understanding of leave-taking. En route we explore how, for example, Catholicism sought to extend life into the third realm of Purgatory, why the Reformation sought to undo those imaginative excursions, and the extent to which the different faiths of figures such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and John Donne produced radically different kinds of finished—and unfinished—works. As we explore the transformative potential of the goodbye in literary and religious works, we also engage with more recent discussions from theologians, theorists, and therapists about grieving, transitions, and letting go. Our objectives are: to strive to understand the important role that leave-takings play in the history of Christianity and artistic expression, especially between 1300–1850; to probe the difference between religious faiths of early modernity with respect to rituals of saying goodbye and the afterlife; to sharpen our skills as readers, spectators, and listeners of works that engage with complex questions regarding the meaning of one's life and one's lifework; and to contextualize our readings within contemporary conversations about dying, grief, and letting go.

2637,202401,1,The Refugee Paradigm: Rethinking the Mediterranean Through Refugees,"Like most refugees, I never imagined that I would, one day, ask for asylum myself.  Growing up in Algeria, I met many exiled Palestinians, Chileans who fled from the Pinochet regime, and others. I felt compassion for them as they tried to carve out lives in a new country, but I never dreamed that I would come to live their struggle. Alas, life is fragile and unpredictable. As the Arabic proverb says, ""Today is on your side, but tomorrow can be against you."" On October 1, 1995, I was forced to leave my hometown of Algiers, fleeing terrorism, religious extremism, and dictatorship. When I arrived at Fiumicino Airport in Rome, I felt relief because I trusted article 10 of the Italian Constitution which states: ""A foreigner who, in his home country, is denied the actual exercise of the democratic freedoms guaranteed by the Italian constitution shall be entitled to the right of asylum under the conditions established by law. A foreigner may not be extradited for a political offense."" Sadly, like many refugees before and after me, I learned that one cannot always trust the law. I was detained for six days and risked deportation and torture back home. I lived the worst days of my life in hopelessness and desperation. I was very lucky to get out of the airport, apply for asylum, and, eventually, receive it. I lived in Italy as a refugee for nine years, working with other refugees as a social worker and an interpreter. This experience shaped my life as a person and as a writer. Refugees in the Mediterranean are double witnesses, on the one hand, to the experience of injustice and dictatorship in their countries of origin, and on the other hand, to the practices of illegality and populism in Italy, France, Spain, Greece, and the other EU countries. Refugees can teach us about the limitations of citizenship rights and the importance of human rights. In this course, we explore the potential to narrate the Mediterranean through what I call the ""refugee paradigm."" This paradigm posits that refugees are not mere victims, resigned to their fates; they are not people simply trying to escape the war. Refugees are not the ""refuse"" of the Mediterranean. Rather, they are central to Mediterranean’s very identity and possible futures. Refugees are brilliant strategists who rewrite the rules of the game, generating new world visions. Over the course of the semester, we investigate the refugee paradigm through the scholarly and political act of personal storytelling.",,HQ 313 - Humanities Quadrangle 313,W 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Wednesday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""HQ 313 - Humanities Quadrangle 313"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95808/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,0.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,1,3.3333333333333335,1,4.0,1,3.3333333333333335,1,,1610,1891,,,,

In this course, we discover a series of transpacific performances and events against the backdrop of Cold War cultural politics, from collaborations between Japanese modern dancers and American jazz musicians in the early 60s to immersive works of Japanese video art presented in New York in the 90s. The rare archival and print materials that form an essential component of this course are made available in English.

2643,202401,1,Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan II,"This is the second part of a year-long seminar (first part CPLT 904) to introduce students to the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses. We rigorously study key concepts of continental psychoanalytic theory that students have heard or read about before but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called ""the language of psychoanalysis,"" as well as tools for their critical practice in humanities disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, sociology, etc. Concepts studied include the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's return to it. We pay special attention to Freud's ""three"" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's ""three"" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). The corpus treated in this seminar comes from continental Europe and includes few materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the USA. During the second term and depending on the interests developed by the group in the first term, we devote five weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, fetishism, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, or to special circulations of psychoanalytic concepts across different disciplines, such as film theory or the critique of ideology. Commentators and critics of Freud and Lacan are also consulted (Michel Arrivé, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, André Green, Markos Zafiropoulos, and others). No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. We start at the beginning and the simplest questions are the most useful. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome. Taught in English.

2692,202401,1,Early Japanese Song and Poetry,"The genesis of Japanese literature is found in musical and dramatic performance traditions. Many of these began as religious rituals and cultural practices built around the telling and reenacting of myths, performances of regional folk songs, and regional and clan folk tales, eventually developing into the literary traditions that continue to define Japanese literature today. This course explores these early traditions, considering the synchronic and historical relationships of music and poetry as dynamic vernacular traditions. Over the course of the semester, we read key texts in vernacular songs from the kayō ""oral songs"" and waka, exploring the rich intersections of music, performance, literacy, orality, and ritual in the early vernacular tradition from roughly 700 to 1700. The seminar is organized by topic according to a rough chronological history from the earliest recorded songs to their reception by Kokugaku scholars in the early modern period. Each week we read selections of song and poetry from a variety of texts, in addition to secondary readings. We discuss and engage in close readings of the selections. Students have the opportunity to present and bring in their own selections throughout the semester. Students should expect to learn how to read early song collections, especially Heian period fuhon ""songbooks,"" in a literary and broadly historical context. Students also cultivate a deeper understanding of performance contexts, ritual forms, the materiality of kayō as textual productions, and their literary intersections. Many of the readings are in Japanese and this seminar is intended for students who reading proficiency in modern Japanese. The song and poetry selections are written in Classical Japanese, however, they are all available with modern translations. When these are not available, the instructor provides translations as needed.",Prerequisite: reading proficiency in Japanese.,HQ C07 - Humanities Quadrangle C07,T 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"",""HQ C07 - Humanities Quadrangle C07"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563690""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95947/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,4.6,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1664,1946,,,,

2695,202401,1,Mapping Asia: A World-History Perspective (Thirteenth–Eighteenth Centuries),"Maps and mapping processes have become multilayered and transdisciplinary objects of study and analysis. Long considered and evaluated exclusively as objective scientific tools par excellence, in recent decades they have undergone a profound reconceptualization that has accentuated their being primarily devices of cultural interpretation framed in specific contexts of political, religious, colonial, social, and economic power. This stratification makes maps and mapping operations particularly interesting objects of historical analysis that have generated interest in many fields of knowledge, conveying perspectives, knowledge, interests, and worldviews through a combination of visuality and writing. These specific ""intentionalities"" aim to make an impact on the communities and societies they address: by representing worlds, they create worlds. It is these intentionalities that the course aims to bring out, study and analyze, particularly in the context of Asia, which has been mapped very precociously and has been a very important area of investigation and exploration by foreign travelers. Asia occupies a central place in the imagined geography of cartographers, as maps have been a fundamental tool that has shaped the continent, its self-perception, and its understanding of the world. Special attention is given to early modern mapping processes and cartography, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. This period became a turning point in the way both European and Asian cartographers saw their regions and represented them, also giving rise to cartographic productions that complemented or juxtaposed their knowledge systems. The circulation of knowledge and visual cultures among cartographers from both macro-regions, with a focus on Japan and China, is a focus of the course. The analysis of the cartographic construction of Asia and its regions is integrated with a world history– research perspective, from classical to modern times, spanning the cultures of Asia, Europe and Islamic Africa, in turn examined through the maps that different cultures made of their own worlds. Students also have the opportunity to analyze a selection of historical maps in the Beinecke Library collections to discover how maps have variously embodied cultural lenses, religious beliefs, scientific discoveries, and political concerns.",,WLH 012 - William L.

Behavioral finance is a large and active field that studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and then consider a number of applications: asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns); individual trading behavior; and corporate finance (security issuance, corporate investment, and mergers).",,EVANS 4200 - Edward P Evans Hall 4200,Th 4:10pm-7:10pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""16:10"",""19:10"",""EVANS 4200 - Edward P Evans Hall 4200"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94278/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,2.271052631578947,4.85,4.85,1,2.5789473684210527,1,4.85,1,2.5789473684210527,1,,1698,1983,,,,

In its contemporary meaning, ""paresse"" or laziness tends to be evoked in relation to work and is inseparable from the question of productivity (consider recent debates regarding ""burnout""). The purpose of this seminar is to bring to light more complex issues related to laziness by returning to the origins of ""paresse"" as it is represented in France in the texts and iconography of the Early Modern period. Our goal is to recover the spiritual, ethical, and medical repercussions of laziness, as well as its philosophical, cultural, and more specifically literary implications. Was it simply conceived in opposition to work, or did it propose a more protean category for thinking about the relationship to time and space? We consider the mechanisms of subjection of the idle body (""corps libertin,"" ""corps mondain""), as well as its modalities of ""resistance,"" a notion that will prove to be somewhat different to that propounded by Foucault. Primary texts include Erasmus's Adagia, a humanist reappropriation of ancient traditions, to representations of the supposed laziness of so-called ""exotic"" peoples in travel literature, ""epic"" laziness in Ronsard's unfinished La Franciade, libertine laziness in L'Isle des hermpahrodites, lazy gallantry in Madeleine de Scudéry's ""De la Paresse,"" and, of course, Montaigne's ""nonchalance.""

2807,202401,1,Sentimentalism and its Critics,"This course explores the long history and enduring force of sentimentalism as a cultural mode, with a particular focus on its complex relationship with its critics. Perhaps the paradigmatic object of aesthetic derision, sentimentalism also has a peculiar tendency to anticipate and feed off its own critique and disavowal. Tracking the entangled careers of sentimentalism and anti-sentimentalism from the ""Pamela media event"" to recent scholarly debates over the cultural work of sentimentality, we consider its function as a limit case for theories of the aesthetic and as a charged site for thinking about the politics of culture. In the process, we reckon with both the historical specificity of sentimentalism—its distinct trajectories in British, European, and American contexts—and its striking mobility and persistence as a cultural code. How does sentimentalism challenge the period and geographical boundaries that we typically use to organize our objects of study? What opportunities does it present for criticism now? Texts may include works by Jane Austen, Claire de Duras, Olaudah Equiano, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry Mackenzie, Samuel Richardson, Charlotte Smith, Laurence Sterne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mary Wollstonecraft; and critical writings by Lauren Berlant, Julie Ellison, Saadiya Hartman, Claudia Johnson, and Eve Sedgwick, among others.",,LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319,Th 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Thursday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""LC 319 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 319"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93918/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.2000000000000002,4.714285714285714,5.0,1,3.8,1,5.0,1,3.8,1,,1769,2057,,,,

More specifically, the arc of the course branches into three major currents. The first highlights queer and trans authors whose collections are housed in the Beinecke Library, including Richard Bruce Nugent, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, and James Baldwin. The second current turns to queer and trans archives that have been digitized, including a wide range of periodicals, photographs, scrapbooks, and newsletters now available online. Finally, a third current tracks fictional and cinematic works that reimagine or incorporate the archive as an object of knowledge, including Isaac Julien’s Looking for Langston (1989) and Shola von Reinhold’s Lote (2020).",,LC 104 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 104,W 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LC 104 - Linsly-Chittenden Hall 104"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560111""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93929/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.0,4.375816993464053,4.222222222222222,1,3.2222222222222223,1,4.222222222222222,1,3.2222222222222223,1,,1772,2060,,,,
2811,202401,1,Literary Production: Prose,"This course provides students an in-depth look into contemporary literary production from all sides of the publishing process: that of the writer, the reader, and the editor. It is grounded in the idea that writing and reading are interconnected practices, as well as the belief that learning to read as an editor will help students become better writers of fiction and nonfiction. The course also teaches students about contemporary literary practices within a deeper historical context of so-called ""little magazines,"" which have shaped the trajectory of both literary and intellectual history in the United States. Under the instruction of current editors of the newly relaunched Yale Review, and housed at the Review’s offices, this course offers students invaluable hands-on experience at a state-of-the-art literary and cultural magazine from which they emerge as sharper readers and bolder writers and with an introduction to editing skills. Reading as an editor for a magazine  deepens students’ understanding of style, form, aesthetics, and genre. Course conversations and assignments burrow into the specific operations of The Yale Review at the same time that they survey a range of publications from the broader US literary landscape, introducing students to the skills and questions that go into publishing a state-of-the-art cultural magazine in the twenty-first century. They read fiction and nonfiction submissions from our queue, as well as published work by some of the submitting writers; they then discuss which pieces may merit eventual publication and why. They are introduced to the concept of assigning pieces and thinking about how and when public writing and in particular the work of little magazines can add value to an ever-more fast-paced and reactive media landscape. As we teach them about the merits of slow thinking and editing, students follow drafts of pieces as they go through the process of acceptance and editing, offering notes; they also work on a piece of public writing of their own, which they take through a draft and a serious revision process. Weekly course packets of active TYR submissions are provided to students.

2905,202401,1,Energy Justice Seminar,"The field of energy justice is evolving rapidly. Just two years ago, this course defined energy justice as ""the goal of achieving equity in the social and economic participation in the  energy system, while also remedying social, economic, and health impacts on those  disproportionately harmed by the energy system."" In late 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, capping a run of new, climate and energy related funding totalling almost $2 trillion; and 40 percent of the benefits of that funding (presumably far greater than $2 trillion) are supposed to flow to ""disadvantaged communities."" Internationally, the UN Conferences of the Parties over the last few years have also sought to institutionalize financial and policy mechanisms meant to fill an estimated $500 billion per year gap in clean energy finance to the Global South. As we enter 2024, energy justice is a burgeoning field of real-world practices driving beyond equity and remedies into major domestic and international financial instruments as well as on-the-ground energy projects of significant magnitude. Drawing on Yale’s faculty and practitioners from the field, this energy justice seminar gives students detailed insight into the latest thinking and practice and help prepare students to work in this field. The seminar is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing from multiple disciplines, including but not limited to law, sociology, anthropology, and economics. It covers topics relating to energy justice in the areas of policy and regulation, community advocacy, legal implications, health implications, and private sector innovation.",,BOWERS AUD - Bowers Hall AUD,M 10:30am-11:50am,"{""Monday"":[[""10:30"",""11:50"",""BOWERS AUD - Bowers Hall AUD"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559547""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95735/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.1875,3.4,3.0,1,1.8125,1,3.0,1,1.8125,1,,1867,2155,,,,

2922,202401,1,Engaging Landholders and Communities in Conserving and Restoring Tropical Forest Landscapes,"The design and implementation of sustainable land management strategies in tropical forest landscapes must effectively involve the people and communities who manage and govern these regions. In many cases, however, practitioners design projects that focus on technical solutions only and ignore people altogether, or base their projects upon incorrect assumptions about the people at the heart of their interventions. These trends ultimately lead to project failure and can cause a host of adverse unintended consequences that further exacerbate the problems that practitioners were trying to resolve. This pattern is particularly prevalent with recent pledges by global organizations and national governments to plant trillions of trees around the globe in an effort to address the adverse effects of climate change (The Bonn Challenge and Trillion Trees). While these initiatives are well-intended, they largely ignore the sociocultural and political complexities of the landscapes where the trees would be planted, including whether landholders already plant or protect trees and if they want to increase this practice and how; which species they want to plant or protect and how; and the effects of tree planting on land tenure systems, traditional livelihood strategies, and gender dynamics.

2929,202401,1,Fundamentals of Working with People,"Environmental scientists and environmental managers are working to transform environmental outcomes by changing institutional and human behavior. Research indicates time and time again that teams are important for tackling these important challenges. From developing research projects to building a business or NGO, teams can lead to better, more efficient output because they incorporate various perspectives and benefit from a wider range of skill sets. But developing and deploying effective teams is an art and a science, full of its own challenges. It requires a deep understanding of self, including one’s own strengths, blind spots, priorities, and needs. It also requires reflection, empathy, communication, and collaboration. This course aims to introduce students – particularly scientists and environmental managers – to the theory and practice of team management. Through a series of lectures, simulations, reflections, discussions, and exercises, students will increase their ability to: (1) Understand themselves and other individuals; (2) Form and lead diverse teams; (3) Influence the actions of the organizations within which they are working; (4) Collaborate with others affecting the resources about which they care.",,BOWERS AUD - Bowers Hall AUD,TTh 8:30am-9:50am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""8:30"",""9:50"",""BOWERS AUD - Bowers Hall AUD"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559547""]],""Thursday"":[[""8:30"",""9:50"",""BOWERS AUD - Bowers Hall AUD"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559547""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95758/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.9523809523809526,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1,2.7142857142857144,1,4.666666666666667,1,2.7142857142857144,1,,1890,2178,,,,

How is this being done—and how has it changed over time? What lessons are we learning—and what overarching issues remain problematic? Specific topics include how different players define and value wildness; selection and prioritization of conservation targets; comparisons of various species and landscape conservation approaches; and governance and decision-making in conservation, including ties between conservation and development and community-based conservation. During the term, students work in small teams to assess one of several current case studies—integrating biological, social, economic, and governance considerations—to propose an effective path forward for conservation.

To address these challenges, major nonprofit organizations have collaboratively designed a set of decision-support tools for planning field projects and programs and for monitoring their progress, summarized in the ""Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation"" (http://cmp-openstandards.org). Use of these tools has allowed organizations to more clearly articulate strategies, define priority actions, critically assess success, manage adaptively, and derive lessons—all of which help to improve effectiveness and respond to donor interests. Students in this course explore a mutually reinforcing suite of these project tools: their underlying principles are introduced, students practice the techniques, and current case studies from field conservation are examined to explore tool utility. Students synthesize use of these design tools in a final project proposal focused on a single case study of their choice.

Theories of federalism, regionalism, states’ rights, and localism are studied, as are the cases that provide a foundation in regulatory takings and the legitimate scope of land use regulation. The history of the delegation of planning and land use authority to local governments is traced, leading to an examination of local land use practices that relate to human settlement patterns, water resources, low-impact development, watershed protection, alternatives to Euclidean zoning, brownfields redevelopment, and resiliency and adaptation in response to sea-level rise and climate change. Students engage in empirical research to identify, catalog, and evaluate innovative local laws that successfully protect environmental functions and natural resources, and the manner in which towns incorporate climate change into their planning and regulations. Nearby watersheds are used as a context for the students’ understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of local planning and regulation.

2994,202401,1,Pier Paolo Pasolini and the Politics of Art History: Contaminating Tradition,"The most visible openly gay intellectual of post-fascist Italy, Pier Paolo Pasolini, thought of himself as a poet. Half a century after his tragic death, he is mostly celebrated around the world as a filmmaker. But he was also a successful novelist, a scandalous dramaturg, a radical theorist of languages and signs, an advocate for local and ancestral traditions, a cosmopolitan polemicist, a journalist, a critic, and a celebrity. One way to cross such a multifaceted, prodigious creative life as it interacted with the culture and society of its turbulent contexts is to keep in mind that Pasolini was trained as an art historian, and that the history and criticism of art remained vital in every aspect of his volcanic, contradictory work. In this interdisciplinary seminar we examine the role of visual art in his oeuvre, focusing on how Pasolini turned art history into an extension of his contemporary political reality while maintaining a deeply strained rapport with the artistic production of his own time. Pasolini’s studies under the distinguished art historian Roberto Longhi at the University of Bologna resulted in what he would deem a ""figurative epiphany"": an approach to representation anchored in painterly vision, guided by the potential ""plasticity"" of the cinematic image, further nourished by his early practice as a painter and art critic. Yet the place and power of art history in Pasolini’s work cannot be confined to his films’ renowned pictorial citations or tableaux vivants. He established deep friendships and violent antagonisms with both obscure and celebrated artists of his time, he conjured pictorial visions in his poetry, he participated in conferences and reviewed or introduced exhibitions. Our goal in this seminar is to go beyond the most famous manifestations of painterly culture in Pasolini’s cinema and read his early art criticism, his poetry about painting, and his aesthetic theories, towards an appreciation of what it meant to be a public intellectual in an age and place in which art was an integral part of ideological debates.","Reading knowledge of Italian would be helpful but is not necessary. Please note that this course is offered at the same time at New York University (by Professor Ara H. Merjian) and Yale University, with the idea that students visit each other’s campus for joint seminar meetings at various points in the semester (all Metro North travel expenses are paid for).",WLH 112 - William L.

2996,202401,1,"Italian Film Ecologies: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow","Landscape and the natural environment have never occupied ""background"" status in Italian film. Given the spectacular visual presence of its terrain—thanks to the relative proximity of mountain chains and the long seacoast—and given the pivotal importance of farming and pasturage in this traditionally agrarian economy, the synergy between the human and natural worlds has played a prominent role in Italian filmmaking since the very inception of the industry. Most recently, two developments have pushed this issue to the forefront of scholarly attention: the advent of ecocriticism, which found one of its earliest and most influential champions in Serenella Iovino, and the establishment of regional film commissions, grassroots production centers that sponsored cinematic works attuned to the specificity of ""the local."" The course includes study of films that predate our current environmental consciousness, as well as recent films that foreground it in narrative terms. In the case of the older films, which have already attracted a great deal of critical commentary over time, we work to shift our interpretive frame in an ""eco-friendly"" direction (even when the films’ characters are hardly friends of the environment). Among the films considered are Le quattro volte, Il vento fa il suo giro, L’uomo che verrà, Gomorra, L’albero degli zoccoli, Riso amaro, Red Desert, Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Il ladro di bambini.

3012,202401,1,Narrative Storytelling for Policy Makers,"Human beings are storytellers. We tell stories to impart to the chaos of our lives some order and meaning, or to generate empathy, or to convince others to understand some version of a particular reality. Research has shown that people remember information better—and are more inclined to believe that that the information is true—when it is presented in the form of a story, that is, with a beginning, middle, and end; characters and setting; and coherent cause and effect. In this class, we study how the craft of narrative storytelling can be deployed to further improve the public’s understanding of politics and/or a particular policy. Students identify a policy or political topic that holds their interest, conduct their own independent research to learn more about their topic, and write a public-facing feature length narrative intended to introduce the topic to a larger audience, shaping their research into a coherent and compelling story. To learn storytelling techniques—and how they might be applied to a policy context—students study a range of policy-focused narratives, learning how craft can help generate maximum effect. In addition to craft, we also study the ethical questions raised by storytelling: our lives do not resolve neatly into a story; a story, therefore, is an artificial construct. Therefore, all stories, even those based on a ""true"" reporting of facts, are, in a certain sense, false, capable of corrupting rather than enlightening the reader’s understanding.

3020,202401,1,Measuring Well-Being: Concepts and Application,"This course has two objectives. First, it introduces the conceptual literature on the measurement of well-being (inequality, poverty, social mobility), undertaking readings that focus more specifically on each of these three dimensions of well-being. This approach introduces contemporary measures of each of these dimensions in a way that links them to their conceptual foundations. In line with contemporary practice, discussion includes both money measures (income and expenditures) and multidimensional measures (such as education, health, and access to services). With this understanding of the measures in place, the second objective is to take students into the computer lab to make use of household survey data and the statistical package Stata to measure well-being and assess policy. The quantitative work in classes and labs focuses on South Africa. However, the course has applicability to any country with good survey data. Students are introduced to the broad range of data sets available to them at Yale and write a term paper using a non-South African data set of their choice to analyze a dimension of well-being. This is a structured exercise, starting with a proposal, moving to a draft, and then a final hand-in.","Prerequisites: Students are expected to be familiar with basic econometric/statistical methods through multivariate linear regression and to have experience with Stata.

3022,202401,1,Rebuilding Nations After Atrocity,"The transition from war to peace entails daunting challenges like demilitarization, economic reconstruction, and the renewal of the state. When conflict involved atrocities—that is, widespread and systematic attacks against civilian populations, the transition is even more fraught, with questions of transitional justice, refugee reintegration, and political reconciliation looming large. The legacies of atrocities are such that transitions require more than money for post-conflict development or ingenuity for institutional (re-)engineering. They also require a reimagination of the relationships among fellow citizens and between the citizenry and the state. In short, the task at hand following a conflict that featured atrocities involves the rebuilding of nations. This course examines many of the facets of such transitions, including all of those named above. It examines cases that reflect different experiences with nation rebuilding, inspecting the roles (and motives) of a variety of actors, both domestic and international.

Yet the potential risks also are extraordinary. How can we build AI systems that are reliable, transparent, safe, scalable, and aligned with human values? Following an introduction to AI and survey of current research challenges, the seminar focuses on seven core areas where AI and emergent technologies already pose significant security concerns: (1) lethal autonomous weapons and the nature of conflict, (2) disinformation and the future of democracy, (3) competition and conflict in U.S.-China relations, (4) AI ethics and safety, (5) AI governance, (6) nanotechnology and quantum computing, and (7) outer-space development.

3037,202401,1,Leadership,"This course is designed for students wanting to deeply reflect on what it means to be a leader, and to help them prepare for leading others in their future. Amongst the many pressures of the role, leaders affect the lives of those they lead, influence the health of the organization they oversee, and hold an important role in advancing social progress. Many learn these realities through trial and error but are rarely given the time to consider what leadership truly entails and how we, as individual leaders, will handle the challenges that lie ahead.  From heading up a small team to running a major organization, leadership is often an isolating and uncertain position, but is also full of opportunity to positively impact others, and to advance society broadly. Leadership is challenging, exciting, and sometimes terrifying; but most importantly, it is a choice to which one must recommit every day. This course is designed to offer a foundation in the practice of leadership for students who want to take on these challenges in their future. The course is divided into three main sections: historic perspectives on leadership, leadership in context, and personal reflections on leadership. Students finish the semester with a foundational understanding of leadership models throughout history, a range of case studies to refer to in the future, and most importantly, a personal framework that can be applied and expanded throughout their journey and growth as a leader. Students do not leave with all the answers they need to conquer the countless challenges that leaders face, but they instead leave with an understanding of how leaders work, every day, to improve themselves and better the lives of those they lead.",,HLH55 HORCHOW - 55 Hillhouse HORCHOW,Th 9am-10:50am,"{""Thursday"":[[""9:00"",""10:50"",""HLH55 HORCHOW - 55 Hillhouse HORCHOW"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560099""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/93972/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Application required and open until November 22 at midnight!

3038,202401,1,Disinformation in the Age of AI,"The aim of this course is to equip students with an applied understanding of the emerging threats and potential solutions to AI-powered manipulation. Grounded in historical context, the course takes an interdisciplinary lens to the evolution of manipulative media and propaganda from the Roman empire to the near future. The consumption and production of misinformation is first studied at the level of the individual producer and consumer using recent anthropological research. Students test out cutting edge techniques from psychology (inoculation theory) and behavioral economics (nudge theory) to resist the effects of manipulation and learn how these are being applied in new technologies and regulations. Subsequent classes survey the larger economic and political forces shaping the supply and demand of misinformation, including government regulatory efforts on AI and misinformation, plus the ""dark web"" of unmoderated online platforms. To understand the power of new generative AI tools firsthand, students take a hands-on approach to experiment with both generative AI creation and detection.",,WLH 209 - William L.

3040,202401,1,Global Law and Policy of AI,"For those interested in developing artificial intelligence systems and those who want to study its many implications, understanding the legal background against which AI stands is crucial. Legislation, policymaking, and case law have enabled the dominant business models for AI products and can also change as new winds prompt regulators into a reexamination of choices and incentives. Indeed, the law is not yet settled for central questions for AI. Ongoing litigation, enforcement action, and debates threaten the lawfulness of AI models that implicate privacy and data protection laws, copyright law, and anti-discrimination laws, to name a few. At the same time, new governance structures and regulatory frameworks are being proposed or taking hold. This course explores how law made AI, what challenges it poses to leading products, and which governance options are now being discussed. Students develop a foundational grasp of legal concepts and policy issues which benefit both those who see themselves as AI practitioners and those who research or critique it. Throughout the semester, students consider the geopolitics of the law and policy underpinning AI, with the dominancy of U.S. law now facing a challenger in the ""Brussels effect"" of EU regulation. Students discuss topics such as facial recognition, mis- and disinformation, workplace surveillance, privacy, and copyright. The first part of the course offers a guide of frameworks in the U.S. such as the Communications Decency Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the Copyright Act, as well as global regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. This provides a basis for the second part, an exploration of leading proposals for regulation put forward in the U.S., the EU, and in Latin America, as well as the potential and limitations of approaches for AI ethics, self-regulation, and other forms of governance. No assumptions are made about prior familiarity with AI or the legal system.",,WTS A68 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street A68,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""WTS A68 - Watson Center 60 Sachem Street A68"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559919""]]}",[],[],1.0,,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95189,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.2857142857142856,4.285714285714286,4.285714285714286,1,3.0,1,4.285714285714286,1,3.0,1,,1998,2288,,,,

3133,202401,1,Global Materiality of Color,"This seminar explores a global phenomenon wherein color makes meaning beyond sheer coloration and complements the function and meaning of artworks, inseparable from their conceptual properties. The seminar has two fundamentally different but reciprocal inquiries. The first is to study how pigments and dyes entangle with the wider world, reconstructing the history of their production and circulation along with the worldview of minerals and dyes in a given civilization. This inquiry leads to a better understanding of the history of trade, economy, science, medicine, chemistry, technology, and culture. The second inquiry, which fundamentally concerns art historians, studies how the production and circulation of pigments and dyes, as well as views on the material, permeate the conceptual property of artworks, such as paintings and murals, and colored objects, such as textiles and sculptures. Together, we explore the multivalent significance of colors—cochineal, indigo, Maya blue, malachite, azurite, lapis lazuli, and gold—across cultures.

Through a transhistorical series of case studies of the art of Mesoamerica, the Andes, and Native North America, we examine what fueled this vision of Indigenous art and how it intersects with colonialist and nationalist discourses, as well as counter-efforts for Indigenous storywork and language revitalization. By critically analyzing major works of scholarship from art history, anthropology, and Indigenous studies, we examine how different writers and thinkers approach and employ the relationship between verbal and material expression. Additionally, we apply language-based analysis as a method for the study of specific works of Indigenous art, while also thinking critically about this methodology’s particular resonances in light of regional histories of colonialism and nationalism.",,LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259,Th 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Thursday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""LORIA 259 - Loria Center 259"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560066""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95439/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,0.75,5.0,5.0,1,4.25,1,5.0,1,4.25,1,,2057,2376,,,,
3135,202401,1,Aesthetics of Collage,"This seminar considers collage (and its cognates papier collé, décollage, decoupage, photomontage, construction, assemblage, and combine) as a medium, a set of historical practices, and an aesthetic attitude, with a focus on the nineteenth century to the present, and on the European and American traditions. Arguably ""the single most important medium to be developed in the twentieth century,"" as one writer has put it, it is at the same time a multi-medium, an inter-medium, and an anti-medium, a ""border art"" situated in the interstices between painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, and drawing but occupying none of those categories fully. Defined by its impurity, its ""tactile reality"" and its multifarious materialities and described by most writers on the subject as radically heterogeneous and fundamentally hybrid in character—a matter of juxtapositions, dislocations, and discordances, of plurality, polysemy, and parataxis—it also opens onto a critique of essentialist categories and reductivisit aesthetics, celebrating relationality in their stead and proposing a redefinition of the concept of ""medium"" as an environment, if not an ecology. Topics to be considered include: nineteeth century Victorian scrapbooking; cubist collage and Greenbergian medium-specificity; futurist, dada and surrealist collage practices; the photogram, photomontage and film montage; collage as an urban form, a collecting and recycling of urban detritus; assemblage and the ""flatbed picture plane""; globalization and ""diasporic collage""; collage as a Black feminist practice; and collage as an ecosystem. Texts to be read might include: Dawn Ades, Photomontage; Dawn Ades and Daniel F.

3136,202401,1,Medieval Art Travel Seminar,"This advanced graduate seminar explores issues pertaining to the art and architecture of medieval Europe that can only be fully investigated on site. Readings, discussions, and short presentations by students in class meetings lay the theoretical and historical groundwork for a trip to Europe at the end of the term, typically lasting for twelve to fourteen days. Final papers of approximately twenty to twenty-five pages, which are begun prior to the trip but build on experiences at the sites, are due within a month after our return. The theme for spring 2024 is Boundaries, Borders, and Passages in Late Medieval Art and Architecture. The topic is two-pronged: it covers both empirical and historiographical content. On the empirical side, we consider the ways Gothic buildings themselves call attention to boundaries and passages—both internally and externally, horizontally and vertically—through their spires, stairways, screens, portals, and ephemeral embellishments such as winged altarpieces, textiles, and portable objects; both churches and castles, moreover, blur the boundaries between the secular and sacred domains that they purportedly distinguish. Late medieval paintings, too, often display a play with frames and boundaries that attests to a sensitivity to these architectural and spatial configurations. On the historiographical side, we see that the vast majority of late medieval buildings and their arts do not fall neatly into the geographical, chronological, and medial categories to which scholarship likes to assign things. The national boundaries we recognize today were not fixed in the Middle Ages, and the people who commissioned, fabricated, used, and wrote about architecture then did not distinguish period styles the way we do. Exciting things may happen when we art historians cross the boundaries that typically hold works of late medieval art apart and think about the passages that link them through time, place, and medium. The travel portion of the seminar charts an unconventional trajectory from Frankfurt, in the fifteenth century as now a wealthy trading center in the Middle Rhine region, through a series of sites in eastern and central France, to Barcelona, another mercantile and political hotspot. Along the way we visit important sites (buildings and museums) in Strasbourg, Dijon, Conques, Albi, Carcassonne, and Vic—always thinking of the changing environments we move through, and the responsiveness of the buildings to their own distinctive places and histories even as reverberate with each other.","This class is limited to eight students.

Scholars of religion often describe this encounter as ""cynical"" or a form of ""bad-faith"", claiming that right-wing movements ""use"" religious doctrines to justify their positions to win over the pious and faithful. In contrast, this seminar analyzes the various ways in which religious ideas and beliefs have played an integral role in the shaping of right-wing platforms and challenging secular, liberal, and cosmopolitan values. The seminar examines primary works penned by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating various movements and parties associated with the Right in America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The course is divided into three sections, Nationalism, Traditionalism, and Conservatism. It covers movements and ideologies ranging from Christian Nationalism, to Identitarianism, to Hindutva, to National Conservativism, to Eurasianism. Primary and secondary readings include, among others, texts written by Marcel Gauchet, Norberto Bobbio, Roger Scruton, Katherine Stewart, Marlene Laurelle, Joseph De Maistre, René Guènon, Julius Evola, Vinayak Damodar Savakar, Bat-Yeor, René Girard, Alexander Dugin, Phyliss Schlafly, Yoram Hazony, Alain de Benoist, and Peter Thiel. The seminar is restricted to graduate students.

3211,202401,1,"History of Medieval Christianity: Learning, Faith, and Conflict","The Middle Ages have been defined by European culture as the period between 500 CE and 1500 CE. It is a period that witnesses the transformation of European Christianity into a Latin-speaking religious community under the Pope. It became increasingly separate from the developments in the Near East and Asia. All too long this epoch has served in legitimating discourses of confessions, nations and ethnic groups, such as in the nationalistic construction of the Germanic tribes. The course aims to draw a new image of these thousand years in terms of time, geography, ethnicity, gender, and culture. Medieval Christianity offers multiple possibilities for understanding both the perils and development of Christianity in an age of rapid change. On the one hand, the course examines processes of establishing power by exclusion, mainly of Jewish and Muslim believers, and of building strong hierarchies almost exclusively male. On the other hand, we find fascinating debates within Scholasticism about how to combine philosophical reason with Christian faith. Further, we explore the evolving of deep, inner spiritual practices among mystics, with special regard to female nuns, who were prolific writers. From this perspective we see how medieval Christianity is part of what we now experience as global Christianity, making a distinctive contribution to the emergence of a widely shared faith.",,SDQ NIEBUHR - Sterling Divinity Quadrangle NIEBUHR,MW 9:30am-10:20am,"{""Monday"":[[""9:30"",""10:20"",""SDQ NIEBUHR - Sterling Divinity Quadrangle NIEBUHR"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560096""]],""Wednesday"":[[""9:30"",""10:20"",""SDQ NIEBUHR - Sterling Divinity Quadrangle NIEBUHR"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560096""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94849/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,4.294871794871795,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2130,2450,,,,

Depending on enrollment, the instructor assigns passages of appropriate length (e.g., material for one or two sessions or more) from the students’ proposed texts.

3251,202401,1,The Firm in the Social World,"""Many classes in business school examine the market determinants of interactions between firms and between firms and consumers. In this class, we will study how social identities and interactions shape and respond to the behavior of market participants. For example, managers’ biases may affect the hiring, evaluation, and promotion of gender, racial, or religious minorities, which in turn may in turn affect the viability of the firm in the long run. Similarly, peer interactions within the firm and incentives for collaboration with or competition between team members may affect employees’ productivity and job satisfaction. To succeed, managers must navigate the social environment of the firm just as they do the market environment. This class offers a research-driven perspective on the economics of the firm in the social world. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures and student presentations of existing research. Assessment will be based on class participation, in-class presentations, two assignments, and a final project. Students should expect to read, discuss, and present research papers, and to debate firm and public policy choices. The course material draws primarily on contemporary work in labor and personnel economics. The first half of the course focuses on race and gender in the labor market. We will consider present and past differences in career and well-being outcomes by race and gender, and how deliberate discrimination and profit maximizing behavior can contribute to or mitigate these gaps. We will discuss specific management practices related to hiring, evaluation, promotion, and task structure that mediate cross-group differences, as well as how firms and workers respond to policy interventions in these processes, such as board quotas and restrictions on the information that can be used in hiring. Our goal is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the economics of cross-group differences in labor market outcomes, and to highlight the limitations of existing approaches where applicable. The second half of the course focuses on teamwork, competition, and social networks in the labor market. We first consider topics related to team production, such as how managers build productive teams in settings where individual workers compete for promotions, and how inequality and pay transparency within the firm affect job satisfaction and productivity. We then turn to the analysis of networks in the context of hiring and on-the-job performance, with the goal of understanding when, why, and how network ties are valuable for firms and workers. We will combine the theory of personnel economics with applications ranging from pay equity at factories in rural India to mutual fund managers with educational ties to members of corporate boards.""",,EVANS 4400 - Edward P Evans Hall 4400,MW 1pm-2:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:00"",""14:20"",""EVANS 4400 - Edward P Evans Hall 4400"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]],""Wednesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:20"",""EVANS 4400 - Edward P Evans Hall 4400"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94577/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2158,2487,,,,

The subject matter will embrace and integrate such broad key dimensions of strategic change as economic context, shifting markets, emerging technologies, corporate life stage, company culture, and corporate governance together with the character, skill-set, and life stages of individual leaders. The course mission involves three equally important goals. The first is to help students anticipate the multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary aspects of successful planned change from strategic systems to group dynamics and individual psychology. A second is to appreciate the consequences of the unintended effects of strategic change initiatives on work communities and societies at-large. The last is to provide students with an overview of the contemporary industry-specific challenges in an effort to highlight the varied leadership values and skills that are not always apparent as corporations make acquisitions or managers select careers. The course materials used to fulfill this mission require students to be comfortable with a wide variety of learning tools including: research articles; case studies; current industry periodicals; spirited class discussion; role playing; video; and frequent prominent industry leaders as class visitors. Following an overview that builds an analytic framework for the course, the key dimensions of strategic change will be examined through a sequence of industry-by-industry settings including: professional services; financial services; retail; e-commerce; communications and media; recreation and travel; government and nonprofit; industrial and consumer products.

This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions).

3281,202401,1,Data-Driven Value Creation in Healthcare and Life Sciences,"Data has become critical to driving value and innovation in the healthcare and life sciences sectors. The explosion in data processing capabilities and wide adoption of data collection during routine care processes have created opportunities to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, speed therapeutic development, improve care, and, ultimately, better patients' lives. However, along with the opportunities, the explosion also created hidden risks for data-powered businesses. This course will equip students with the knowledge and skills to build sustainable data-driven businesses within the healthcare and life sciences sectors. We will begin by surveying the healthcare data ecosystem and turn to how the data generated by the system can create business value. Along the way, we will become familiar with the foundational concepts of healthcare informatics and the sub-discipline of clinical research informatics, which provide essential frameworks for understanding how to generate, manage, and use healthcare data. We will then look more broadly at models for treating data as an asset and consider how those models apply to healthcare data. We will wrap up by exploring how to assess the business value of healthcare data and how to build processes that enhance that value. In this course, students will shift between two informative perspectives: that of a healthcare data analyst charged with assessing and recommending a healthcare data strategy and an entrepreneur assessing new opportunities in the space. As we work through identifying opportunities and challenges, we will practice asking essential questions and gain first-hand experience in research and business-process-analysis methods used to answer them.

3285,202401,1,Narratives in Health,"""Trust in science among the public is at a recent-historic low, and there are powerful forces working to keep it that way. If experts do not actively engage in the information landscape, their work risks being undone or lost. If they interact in the wrong ways, they could end up only contributing more to the chaos and division that currently characterize the information landscape. Opting out is not an option; we all have public faces now, and the question is how best to develop and utilize them. Given the state of division and distrust that threaten science, it should likely be among the aspirations of every graduate with an interest in healthcare management, science, medicine, and/or public health to have some part in shaping narratives that promote health and fact-based discourse over angry, divisive stagnation. This course invites students to study ways in which it can be done, and to reflect on their own potential, and to try out different techniques and different platforms—to begin to find their public voice. To see what works for some messages and some communicators, and what fails, and why. The course will introduce and study the increasingly broad array of tools to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to influence the lives of many. It is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and to affect the world, but only exacerbate distrust and claims of elitism. Rather science can only exist as an active process of communication between researchers and the public. This is how trust is built and the learning process is most effective, as a mutual, shared endeavor. This is a widely held conception of science, and yet the actual methods of such engagement are overlooked or ignored by many in the health sciences. This course is not prescriptive, but is meant to engage critically with modes of communication and shaping discourse. The course will equip students to critically analyze emerging methods of health-oriented communication. It will offer a survey of many approaches wherein students will develop an understanding of the canonical paths to writing for large audiences (op-eds, long-form journalism)—as well as explore how narratives emerge over time in much smaller and more personal scales. We will study the role that experts play in creating media on their own platforms and by working with media outlets as either sources or contributors, consultants or editors or publishers. It is critical that not all experts communicate in the same styles and on the same platforms. Writing an op-ed in The New York Times is valuable, for example, but the ability to do that is just one tool in what needs to be an arsenal of ways of reaching people across cultural, socioeconomic, ideological, intellectual, and educational backgrounds.""""""",,EVANS 4410 - Edward P Evans Hall 4410,W 4:10pm-7:10pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""16:10"",""19:10"",""EVANS 4410 - Edward P Evans Hall 4410"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94579/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2177,2508,,,,

The course will not use class time to teach valuation or financial analysis. While it is not a prerequisite, a basic understanding of valuation and financial analysis is helpful. If you need additional help with valuation or financial analysis, please see the TAs and Instructor for support which can be provided outside of class. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to explore rollups, consolidations and serial acquisitions as a growth and value creation strategy in an entrepreneurial context. Consolidations have been pursued in manufacturing and services businesses since the mid 1800s when oil and railroad trusts existed. More recently, consolidations have existed in death care services, uniform rental services, manufacturing, food services and financial services. The focus will be on the nature of serial acquisitions as compared to episodic, transformational transactions. This course will explore why this strategy is so compelling to managers and investors. The course instructor completed 38 acquisitions in the records management industry as the CEO of ArchivesOne and 22 acquisitions in the bottleless water industry as the CEO of Onesource Water.

3301,202401,G1,Global Virtual Teams,"The primary goal of this course is to furnish students with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively lead, manage, and function within teams that are both global and virtual in nature. The pandemic has instigated a significant shift in the way we work, changes that are likely to persist. Despite the potential advantages virtual work offers, managing virtual teams presents unique challenges. These challenges are even more pronounced in global virtual teams (GVTs) where cultural differences, time zone variations, and a multitude of other issues can arise, thereby hindering team effectiveness. This course builds upon the foundations of managing organizations, groups, and teams by adopting an action learning approach—providing opportunities to apply knowledge and skills in practice. You’ll participate in a series of exercises that simulate the issues faced by global virtual teams – sometimes emphasizing the ""global"" aspect, sometimes the ""virtual"", and often both. The course is structured into three modules: • MODULE 1 | GVT Class Sessions | 16:10-18:10, Mondays and Wednesdays, January 22, 24, 29, 31, and February 5, 2024 | Building on the concepts and frameworks introduced earlier in the curriculum, these exercise/simulation-based sessions aim to help you extend your knowledge on building, managing, and leading effective teams in global and virtual settings. • MODULE 2 | GVT Negotiation Exercise | February 2 – February 28, 2024 | Jointly run with 10+ GNAM partner schools, this module places you into an GVT, comprising students from different schools around the world. You will complete an interactive learning exercise involving team-building, coordination, decision-making, and cross-team analysis. This assignment offers real-time, hands-on practice in implementing the lessons from Module 1 of this course. • MODULE 3 | GVT Debrief Workshop | 16:10-18:10, Monday, March 4, 2024 | We will reconvene one final time to share your experiences and learnings from the GVT Negotiation Exercise.",,EVANS 2410 - Edward P Evans Hall 2410,MW 4:10pm-6:10pm,"{""Monday"":[[""16:10"",""18:10"",""EVANS 2410 - Edward P Evans Hall 2410"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]],""Wednesday"":[[""16:10"",""18:10"",""EVANS 2410 - Edward P Evans Hall 2410"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94646/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,3388,3822,,,,

3312,202401,1,Leading and Managing Organizations,"Surveys are a critical means of obtaining information about entities of interest, such as customers, employees, voters, students, donors, or research subjects in an experiment. Yale graduates hired by consulting, marketing or non-profit firms, hired by local or federal governments, or starting their own companies are often required to design, evaluate, and/or implement surveys to obtain information about these entities of interest. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the main principles of survey design and analytics in order to obtain the best quality data: surveys whose answers capture the desired information, are implemented with the correct sampling methodology, and that yield low non-response rates. To this end, the course has three parts: (1) How to write good questions and design an effective survey. We cover, among other topics, when to use open-ended versus closed-ended questions; which types of scales to use (for example, unipolar versus bipolar); the optimal number of items on a scale; the best font and visual display for questions; and how to sequence questions optimally. (2) How to pre-test and how to field surveys to boost response rates. We cover, among other topics, the primary ways to pre-test a survey (expert reviews, focus groups, cognitive interviewing and field pre-tests); in which situations is each method most appropriate; how to craft persuasive messaging to increase response rates; and the optimal number of contacts and types of rewards that maximize response rates. (3) How to assess the appropriateness of each of the four commonly used sampling schemes—simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, stratified random sampling, and clustered random sampling—and how to compute quantities of interest, their margins of error, and their confidence intervals under each of these schemes. We will learn the course concepts with a mixture of lectures and hands-on examples, some of which will use STATA. Assignments, readings, in-class handouts, and lecture notes will be posted on the course website. The course will cover many examples of real-world surveys. These include surveys by market research firms to assess preferences towards products, by human resources managers to study employees, by merging firms to assess the suitability of the mergers, by local governments to research on attitudes on social issues and willingness to pay for services, by political polling firms on voting intentions, and by educational organizations to assess student preferences. Requirements: Basic knowledge of Probability or of Statistics. The course is open to all Yale School of Management students and to all those students that have taken an introductory course in either Probability or Statistics.

We cover, among other topics, when to use open-ended versus closed-ended questions; which types of scales to use (for example, unipolar versus bipolar); the optimal number of items on a scale; the best font and visual display for questions; and how to sequence questions optimally. (2) How to pre-test and how to field surveys to boost response rates. We cover, among other topics, the primary ways to pre-test a survey (expert reviews, focus groups, cognitive interviewing and field pre-tests); in which situations is each method most appropriate; how to craft persuasive messaging to increase response rates; and the optimal number of contacts and types of rewards that maximize response rates. (3) How to assess the appropriateness of each of the four commonly used sampling schemes—simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, stratified random sampling, and clustered random sampling—and how to compute quantities of interest, their margins of error, and their confidence intervals under each of these schemes. We will learn the course concepts with a mixture of lectures and hands-on examples, some of which will use STATA. Assignments, readings, in-class handouts, and lecture notes will be posted on the course website. The course will cover many examples of real-world surveys. These include surveys by market research firms to assess preferences towards products, by human resources managers to study employees, by merging firms to assess the suitability of the mergers, by local governments to research on attitudes on social issues and willingness to pay for services, by political polling firms on voting intentions, and by educational organizations to assess student preferences. Requirements: Basic knowledge of Probability or of Statistics. The course is open to all Yale School of Management students and to all those students that have taken an introductory course in either Probability or Statistics. Course Objectives: The goal of the course is to introduce you to the main principles of survey design and analytics in sufficient depth for you to apply these tools during your post-Yale career.",,EVANS 4220 - Edward P Evans Hall 4220,MW 1pm-2:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""13:00"",""14:20"",""EVANS 4220 - Edward P Evans Hall 4220"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]],""Wednesday"":[[""13:00"",""14:20"",""EVANS 4220 - Edward P Evans Hall 4220"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2195,2526,,,,

3321,202401,1,Financing Green Technologies,"""Is Green the new Gold? At least in renewable energy, the last 35 years have seen booms followed by spectacular busts. While the recent collapse of several renewable energy companies--including the much publicized Solyndra--may suggest that this cycle is not much different than the last, many entrepreneurs are still forming green companies. In addition, the ranks of climate change skeptics grows ever thinner in spite of the increase in political partisanship around climate change and renewable energy. This course will explore how investing in renewable energy is different than in investing in more prosaic sectors. These differences include capital intensity, commodity markets, mature industry structure, local and federal regulation, and market imperfections. The course will also review the differences in policy support given to renewable energy in other countries. While the emphasis is on renewable energy, many of the same issues obtain in considering other green technologies—from water to new packaging. The course will rely on real-life case studies to illustrate themes and to expose students to different end markets and to companies along the maturity cycle from early stage ventures to projects using mature technology. In so doing, the course will give some insights as to specialized participants --VC, Private Equity, and Project Finance—fit together in funding a company. Students should expect to leave the class better prepared to address major issues and seize new opportunities in clean energy finance. While the course will use the lens of an investor, most of the issues are the same from the standpoint of a business owner seeking to finance renewable energy activities and a policy maker seeking to encourage capital formation in the sector.

3335,202401,1,Race&MoneyinAmerica,"""Business leaders today face more questions than ever about their companies’ stances on diversity and inclusion and their role in improving it. Black and white professionals alike are re-assessing the habits and rituals in their companies that hold them back from making inclusive products and creating inclusive workplaces. Companies are reckoning with, and in many cases apologizing for, their roles in past injustices. Business leaders are pondering whether they speak out about social issues like voting rights and re-evaluating their marketing of products. Entrepreneurs are finding new opportunities to serve Black, Latino and other underserved populations in some industries. Venture capitalists are increasing the amounts they dedicate to minority-owned businesses. And amidst all this, policymakers are questioning assumptions in government policies that contribute to inequities and taking actions -- like changing laws around race - that will affect decision-making at companies. This course explores the history of race and money in America, dating to the mid-1800s with a focus on Black Americans. The course ties past events to the present and challenges people to explore solutions that would move the needle in creating a more equitable society. The course will be relevant to managers in many industries including insurance, banking, media, technology, education, real estate and more. In viewing the throughline of this history through today’s business lens, there will be many revelations along the way for both people who haven’t studied much history and for those who specialized in Black history. By the end of the course, students will have a clear picture of the economic gap that exists today between white Americans and people of color in many key areas like home ownership, debt, employment and education.""",,EVANS 4430 - Edward P Evans Hall 4430,M 4:10pm-7:10pm,"{""Monday"":[[""16:10"",""19:10"",""EVANS 4430 - Edward P Evans Hall 4430"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94799/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2209,2540,,,,

3339,202401,1,Global Social Entrepreneurship: GSE: Kenya,"The spring 2022 Global Social Entrepreneurship (GSE) course will be likely working with organizations in Kenya. Like the GSE India course (MGT 529), Spring GSE links teams of Yale students with local social enterprises, channeling the skills of Yale students to assist the organizations to expand their reach and impact on ""base of the pyramid"" communities. Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specific management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the semester. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course is taught by Tony Sheldon, Lecturer in the Practice of Management and Executive Director of SOM’s Program on Social Enterprise. The course meets on Tuesday evenings 4:10 – 7:10 during Spring semester. Given the uncertainties around international travel, trip planning for March 2022 (the first week of spring break) is of course tentative at this point in time. As with the International Experience and the Global Network Immersion Week, students would be responsible for covering the costs of their round-trip airfare and related expenses (such as visa and immunizations). Students’ available GSA funds can be utilized to off-set in-country travel, hotel and related costs. The Jackson Institute and the School of the Environment also have funds available to off-set in-country travel related costs for their students. Enrollment is by application only. Students accepted and enrolled in GSE will allocate spring course bidding points towards the course (100 points). Just a reminder that applications for Spring GSE (working with organizations in Kenya) are due by this Sunday, October 24, at midnight. You can also apply for next Fall/Winter’s GSE India course.

3344,202401,1,Patterns in Entrepreneurship,"This course will require active participation in class. Please be prepared and committed to engage in class. If you do not enjoy contributing in class, this might not be the right course for you. Using the Socratic case method, this course will explore several of the many ways to be an entrepreneur. MBA students frequently express interest in doing something entrepreneurial after completing their graduate degree program. Most MBA students with an interest in entrepreneurship consider only a narrow range of potential business opportunities. This course will highlight the multiple ways to become an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship, using HBS Professor Howard Stevenson’s definition of ""pursuing an opportunity beyond the resources controlled,"" is a big tent. Although Silicon Valley technology ventures and flashy consumer products startups receive most of the attention in the media and on campus, there are other ways to jump into the entrepreneurial arena. This course explores six distinct patterns in entrepreneurship (and there might be many more), some of which fly under the radar of many MBA students. This course will not advocate any single pattern of entrepreneurship over the others; rather, the course will encourage students to discover the best potential path for themselves using a ten-step framework for analysis. There is no right or wrong pattern in entrepreneurship – aspiring entrepreneurs owe it to themselves to learn about and contemplate a variety of options. Then, with better information and a higher degree of confidence, they can rigorously evaluate which entrepreneurial path best suits their specific interests, needs, and goals. Additionally, aspiring entrepreneurs should factor risk and lifestyle into their decision-making process. Which form of entrepreneurship has the highest probability of success, however you define it? And which one will best accommodate the lifestyle you envision for yourself? Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted.

Are things going too far? What does it mean for our everyday marketing, operations, HRM, and strategy? Should we now be strategizing, organizing, and leading businesses, differently, and, if so, how?

3356,202401,1,Introduction to Financial Crisis Communications,"""Financial crises do not occur often, but when they do occur, they can have devastating impact on the financial system and economy. The dynamics of financial crises share dynamics with other types of crises but also entail unique characteristics. And government agencies are key participants as well private companies. Repeatedly policymakers and media have lamented that the government could have done a better job communicating during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 (GFC). However, the traditional literature of crisis communication says little about preparing for or managing a financial crisis. In this course you will learn the basic theories of crisis communications and the various communication frameworks and techniques used to respond to crises. With this knowledge, we will then look closely at communications during industry crises and then financial emergencies and crises (and in particular the GFC) to discern what are appropriate communications frameworks for preparing for and addressing a systemic financial crisis.""""""",,EVANS 4230 - Edward P Evans Hall 4230,TTh 10:10am-11:30am,"{""Tuesday"":[[""10:10"",""11:30"",""EVANS 4230 - Edward P Evans Hall 4230"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]],""Thursday"":[[""10:10"",""11:30"",""EVANS 4230 - Edward P Evans Hall 4230"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560094""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94533/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2224,2555,,,,

The class meets on Thursdays, 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. in classroom 2210 beginning on January 27. This course is open to all Yale graduate students as well as Yale College seniors. In order to take this course you must attend the first class meeting on January 27 in its entirety. Also, please note that there is a homework assignment due before the first class. Course description: This course will be co-taught by Jeffrey E. Garten and Robert D. Hormats, whose combined experience spans the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations, as well as decades on Wall Street. The course is based on the premise that America’s role and policies in the global economy are undergoing a profound change that will outlast the current administration in Washington. It will examine the major forces in the U.S. and abroad that will be determining America’s future in the global economy and the likely policies it will follow for the next decade. These will include changes in the country’s industrial and financial structures, new social pressures, new demographic patterns, and evolving political alignments. Typical of the kinds of questions to be examined will be: How will the changing labor force affect America’s interest in the global arena? How will changing technology affect these interests? What about changes in energy and the environment? What will trade policy, policy toward foreign investment and immigration policy look like? How should we think about the changing roles of Wall Street, Corporate America, and Silicon Valley? Regarding developments abroad, we will ask questions such as these: How will China’s evolving interests, or new directions for the European Union, or the changing position of big emerging markets, or new pressures in global finance influence American policy, and with what effect? If the U.S. attempts to reduce its international involvement, who will write and try to enforce the ""rules of the game?""

3378,202401,1,Theory and Praxis of Material Histories,"This year-long workshop focuses on the concepts, debates, methodologies, theories, and real-world constraints of the material histories of the human record across a range of formats and media. Organized around six rubrics—Collecting, Describing, Displaying, Embodying, Disembodying, and Representing—we aim to cut across long-standing divides between collections, archives and libraries, on the hand, and scholarly/artistic spaces of the academic world; between preservation and consumption; between privacy and publicity; between the social sciences and the humanities. Through critical readings that engage with diverse geographic and temporal subjects; the close analysis and physical handling of rare books, maps, manuscripts, images, objects, and textiles; and an orientation to cultural heritage and library professional practices and procedures, students learn the critical interventions of the history of the book and the archival turn in the humanities; the key concepts and genealogies of archives and library special collections; and the generative collaborations currently underway between faculty and librarians to jointly address legacies of racism and white privilege, advance intellectual freedom and parity, and define the ethical stewardship of the material histories of the human record today. This workshop takes the form of a half-credit course in each semester that meets six times a term (every other week). This course must be taken before or after MHHR 700 to earn 1 full credit. We welcome all curious students to the first class, but permission of the instructors is subsequently required for enrollment/registration.",,TBA,M 3:30pm-5:20pm,"{""Monday"":[[""15:30"",""17:20"","""",""""]]}",[],[],0.5,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95385/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,"Class meets 1/22, 1/29, 2/12, 2/26, 3/25, 4/8, and 4/15.",,False,False,False,0.0,4.730769230769231,5.0,1,5.0,1,5.0,1,5.0,1,,2242,2573,,,,

In this seminar we join with students at Princeton University who are taking the same course, to learn about these ancient cities and their social and religious history. Cultural heritage is also addressed. Yale students travel once to Princeton, and Princeton students travel once to New Haven, to learn about the collections that each of our universities has due to early twentieth-century participation in excavations. There, and in our respective universities, we engage in new research into historical reconstructions of Antioch and Dura, focusing on the topic of religion and power, and using literary and material evidence.",,YK220 003 - 220 York Street 003,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""YK220 003 - 220 York Street 003"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563696""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94782/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,1.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1,3.0,1,4.666666666666667,1,3.0,1,,2243,2574,,,,

This seminar proposes for intellectual inquiry the rich traditions that worship, music, and the visual arts have created and continue to offer in the face of death. The focus in this seminar is on the Christian tradition. Given the breadth of the subject matter, the course attends to a broad spectrum of themes quite selectively. Readings of historical sources themselves (textual and nontextual), scholarly research into the past, and analysis of contemporary materials form the core materials. The course is shaped by three foci of inquiry: ritual, music, and art as they relate to (1) those who have died, (2) those who are dying, i.e., facing imminent death, and (3) the confrontation with one’s own dying. The Christian tradition holds rich resources and insights for all three of these subject matters.

3493,202401,1,"Text, Form, and Narrative in Instrumental Music","4 credits, NP. Group A or B. This course surveys major instrumental genres in Western European notated traditions, from the early seventeenth century to the present, in search of sensitive and flexible approaches to the relationship between notated instrumental music and the programmatic titles, texts, and implied narratives that accompanied it, both on the score and in the minds of receptive listeners. Beginning with the earliest published sonatas and proceeding through detailed score study of examples from both small- and large-scale genres (sonata, suite, concerto, symphony, string quartet, concert overture, keyboard miniature, and symphonic poem), the course addresses a wide range of repertoire via historically grounded case studies and occasional forays into contemporary narrative theory. The goal is a fluid and stylistically sensitive approach to musical storytelling through harmony, affect, and form. Composers addressed include Marini, Froberger, Biber, Kuhnau, Corelli, Vivaldi, Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Berlioz, Liszt, Hensel, Brahms, Rimsky-Korsakov, Strauss, Dukas, Dvorák, Debussy, Schoenberg, Still, Messiaen, Gubaidulina, Takemitsu, and Léon.

3495,202401,1,The Ballets Russes,"4 credits. NP. Group B. This course follows the evolution of the Ballets Russes, from its origins at the turn of the twentieth century as part of the Parisian ""World of Art"" exhibitions, in which Sergei Diaghilev imported contemporary art and experimental opera and dance productions from Russia, through its prime years (1909 to 1929) as an established ballet company, and ending in the company’s eventual breaking apart into groups settling in the United States and Monte Carlo. We further examine the subsequent impact of that splitting apart on the contemporary dance, music, and art scenes in the United States. The 1909 to 1929 years are the primary focus of the course, with an emphasis on the musical masterworks that were born of Diaghilev’s vision: works by Debussy, Milhaud, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Ravel, Satie, Respighi, Strauss, and of course, Stravinsky, among many others. We examine how Diaghilev brought together many of the most influential artists of the time, such as Braque, Picasso, Chanel, Matisse, Derain, Miró, de Chirico, Dali, and Cocteau, to collaborate with these composers. Students are given a brief primer on ballet and become familiar with the work of the important choreographers associated with the Ballets Russes, such as Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinksy (as both dancer and choreographer), Léonide Massine, and George Balanchine. Course requirements include a midterm, a final exam, and a paper.",,HEN 314 - Hendrie Hall 314,W 4pm-5:50pm,"{""Wednesday"":[[""16:00"",""17:50"",""HEN 314 - Hendrie Hall 314"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/563676""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/96363/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2273,2667,,,,

3498,202401,1,The Songs and Symphonies of Gustav Mahler,"4 credits. NP. Group A or B. This course surveys the career-spanning creative output of Gustav Mahler (1860–1911), balancing close analytical investigations of individual works with wide-ranging considerations of their historical, philosophical, and critical contexts. Front and center is the music itself: its bold and idiosyncratic use of harmony and orchestral color; its daring, even radical eclecticism; its spiraling contrapuntal sophistication; and above all its rich and multidimensional narrative complexity. All reward close study. But around the music swirls a constellation of long-contested issues: the relevance of Mahler’s own programs and paratexts; the relation of art to lived experience; the capacity of instrumental music to tell stories or ""narrate""; and the symphonies’ stance toward tradition at the dawn of musical modernism. So in grappling with each work, we also have to contend with reception traditions that are varied, complex, and at times irreconcilable. And yet each illuminates some vital aspect of a corpus that is as perplexing and self-contradictory as the man behind it, the absolute-music partisan whose symphonies were programmatic through and through. Course requirements include weekly listening, reading, and analytical work, three brief response papers (1–4 pages), occasional oral presentations, and a final oral examination on topics chosen by the student.",,LEIGH PARK - Leigh Hall (435 College) PARK,MW 10:30am-11:45am,"{""Monday"":[[""10:30"",""11:45"",""LEIGH PARK - Leigh Hall (435 College) PARK"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559539""]],""Wednesday"":[[""10:30"",""11:45"",""LEIGH PARK - Leigh Hall (435 College) PARK"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559539""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/96366/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2276,2670,,,,

Class sessions will be highly interactive, centered on singing, playing, and creating music. Students will be expected to engage in class activities using their voices and primary/secondary instruments—no keyboard experience necessary. Outside of class, students will work on practice-based activities, which will be performed live in class and during individual sessions with the instructor. They will also devise a final project that connects musicianship skills to relevant repertoire; in-class presentations will occur during the final weeks of the semester.

The diverse styles of the instrumental and vocal music composed during this period elicit widely differing responses from instrumentalists and singers attuned to pre-Classical and Romantic performance practices. In this course, which is centered on both performance and discussion, we take in the many possibilities available to the performer of music composed in this period. The topics we explore include Baroque sound, rhetoric, ornamentation and improvisation, vibrato, text-music relationships, tempo and meter, rhythmic alteration, dynamics, pitch, temperament, editions, and basso continuo.

3571,202401,1,Musical Amateurs,"What does a musical amateur sound like? With etymological roots in the Latin amare, amateurism initially referred favorably to someone pursuing an activity for love rather than financial gain. Today, musical amateurs are often understood as those who perform outside of professional settings, receiving little or no compensation for their labor. In other contexts, ""amateur"" has become a pejorative term for those without substantial skill or talent—as George Bernard Shaw famously put it, ""hell is full of musical amateurs."" These definitions, however, barely scratch the surface of amateurism’s complex meanings across musical practices and communities. In this course, we interrogate the shifting role and reputation of the musical amateur, exploring the fluid boundaries between amateur and professional. We also question the relevance of this distinction entirely, considering other ways to understand humans’ motivations for making music—and the standards by which that music is evaluated. Engaging with scholarship across and beyond the music disciplines, we consider how amateurs have provoked conversations around music’s relationship with capitalism, with expertise, with formal education, with pleasure, and with failure.",,STOECK 211 - Stoeckel Hall (renovated) 211,F 9:25am-11:15am,"{""Friday"":[[""9:25"",""11:15"",""STOECK 211 - Stoeckel Hall (renovated) 211"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559930""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/95881/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,4.642857142857143,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2307,2701,,,,

The understanding of such texts without knowledge of versions written in normal orthography is often hampered. The syllabic spellings of Sumerian words in such texts invite comparisons to paratextual remarks such as pronunciation glosses added to literary and lexical texts. A second vantage point is the rich liturgical literature (e.g., lamentations), which is composed in the so-called Emesal register. Apart from Sumerian love songs, the course mainly draws from the corpus of the lamentation singer.

Policy, politics, and process occur in organizational, state, tribal, and federal spaces. In this era of sweeping health reform, it is imperative that students understand the players, the interactions, and the routes to change. The class discusses contemporary policy changes and debates. Students examine a policy relevant to their own work.

3735,202401,1,The Cognitive Significance of Small Experience,"We explore, in detail, the philosophical importance of ""small experiences"": experiences of some feature of the world that we would normally think of as the backdrop to real experience. Attention to the nature of small experience involves heightened attunement to a feature of our surroundings, bringing the significance of this feature into sharper relief. Attending to small experiences disrupts one’s typical modes of perception. It can give one a fresh ability to attend to details, to appreciate the new, but also to notice absences and to apprehend the texture of those absences. The precise nature of each element or detail is noticed, assessed, and perhaps even celebrated. Importantly, this can change one’s cognitive orientation. Accompanying this change in cognitive orientation is a change in temporal consciousness: short events can seem longer. Time can be experienced differently. To implement this idea, we undertake a case study in Japanese aesthetics: the construction of temple gardens. We are particularly interested in studying the type of balance, contrast, and change exhibited by relationships between plants, objects, and the layout and structure of temple gardens that is on display at change of season. We use this case study to explore a range of philosophical ideas involving the nature of consciousness, aesthetic revelation, and the cognitive import of perceptual experience. Assessment is based on class participation, an in-class presentation, and a final paper.",,PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207,T 1:30pm-3:20pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""13:30"",""15:20"",""PH 207 - Phelps Hall 207"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559570""]]}",[],[],1.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94693/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,0.9761904761904767,4.071428571428571,4.142857142857143,1,3.1666666666666665,1,4.142857142857143,1,3.1666666666666665,1,,2441,2859,,,,

We review basic facts concerning global immigration patterns and focus on explaining individual-level attitudes toward immigrants by uncovering mechanisms of anti-immigrant bias and testing different ways to reduce such bias. We ask how we should conceive of membership in a democratic society. Going beyond the question of acquiring a formal legal status (e.g. citizenship) that entitles members to a set of rights, we ask whether citizenship implies the sharing of a common identity. What determines that identity in countries with ethnic vs. civic concepts of nationalism and can immigrants acquire it? Is there a set of norms or behaviors that are expected of citizens—native and immigrants alike—and will adherence with those norms be effective in reducing anti-immigrant bias? The course considers challenges of integrating immigrants in native society and reviews empirical studies that test ways to address such challenges. Students become familiar with all prevalent theoretical perspectives on immigration in political science.

To this end, we review various papers on IPE and IR that make an exemplary use of the various tools of causal inference with strong theoretical foundations.

3861,202401,1,Pauline Theology,"This seminar provides an introduction to the central theological, Christological, soteriological, ecclesiological, eschatological, and ethical themes across Paul's corpus based on select Pauline texts and secondary literature. Paul developed these themes in letters to churches and individuals, so the course focuses on Paul's ""pastoral theology"" rather than ""systematic theology"" (Romans being the closest to the latter). Paul's themes took shape in response to other theologies in early Christianity and ancient Judaism, so the course attempts to draw out the similarities and differences between Paul's and these other strands of tradition. Paul's thought has also animated contemporary conversations among philosophers, ethicists, and theologians, illustrating the enduring significance of his literary output and providing opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Students are expected to explore two topics in Paul's letters in-depth and present the results of their research for discussion and critique to the seminar before submitting a research paper at the mid-point and the end-point of the course. Particularly controversial topics addressed in the course include the role of the Jewish Law, ""the works of the Law,"" the inclusion of the gentiles, justification by faith, faith/faithfulness of Christ, the divine identity of Christ, atonement, resurrection, unity and diversity in the body of Christ, spiritual gifts, universalism, sacramental theology, and apocalyptic theology.

The task of thinking inside these practices brings us to doctrines that have formed at the sites of these practices and which in turn help to shape the practices.

In addition to lectures, each week we discuss the respective texts, interrogating them with respect to the distribution of power, questions arising from colonialism, and issues relevant to the formation of the global Anglican Communion. We ask the questions: What does it mean to be Christian in the Anglican Way, and how do we do Anglican theology? How do we approach the study of the Anglican story in light of the dialectic between the Catholic and contextual, secular and Church, universal and particular, the global and the local? To what extent is the Anglican Way an exercise in depolarization?

3877,202401,1,Natural Theology and the New Animism,"This seminar explores the question and status of natural theology in contemporary theology. We engage the question of a natural theology in relation to recent reflections on animism. Two questions guide our exploration. First, what is the relation between visions of animacy and concepts of revelation? Second, how is knowing (God and self) constituted within and/or formed in resistance to visions of an animate and communicative world? With these questions we are seeking to examine the relationship between the idea of a living communicative God and a living communicative world, and the various effects of how one articulates that relationship.

This course explores the diverse ways that women related to ritual authority in medieval European Christian traditions. Students study abbesses, mystics, reformers, and saints and the ritual authority exerted by these women, both within and outside of hierarchical norms: preaching, performing, reforming liturgical texts, creating new liturgies, teaching, and shaping ritual communities. The close readings of primary texts by and about women—including figures like Heloise, Hildegard, Gertrude the Great, Margery Kempe, Umiltà of Faenza—are complemented by readings in ritual, liturgical, and historical studies. Throughout the semester, students explore the many ways that medieval Christian women related to power, agency, and authority in worship as well as how contemporary Christians and scholars have shaped the story of medieval women.

3888,202401,1,Early Christian Spirituality,"How did early Christians encounter God? How did their understanding of the relationship between the divine and the human shape their lives? What importance did they give to personal religious experience? How did they relate the personal to the teaching they had inherited, the authority of the Church, or shared worship? How do we understand the relationship between spirituality and mysticism, theology, liturgy, or ""the faith""? This course explores how Christian spirituality seeks to make meaning of the divine-human relationship at the intersections of the individual and the collective, tradition and experience, formal and informal religiosity. We also explore the very varied ways in which Christians between the first and fifth centuries thought about spirituality: through receiving the Spirit or reading the scriptures; embracing the world or denying it; by seeing, not seeing, or learning to see differently; by imitating Christ or reflecting on their own lives; in solitude or in shared worship.

In particular, we explore and begin to formulate perspectives on the purpose, function, contexts, and methods of religious education. The course is guided by two essential questions posed by religious educator Mary Boys: What does it mean to be religious? What does it mean to educate in faith, to educate persons to the religious dimensions of life? Boys’s guiding questions push us to think about how our understandings of religion and religious education are historically situated and how these understandings reflect specific theological and pedagogical commitments. Answering these questions also requires us to explore the perceived and real challenges to living and growing as persons of faith in our U.S. and global communities. For example, in this course we explore how persons and communities of faith educate in ways that foster theological reflection and constructive responses to myriad challenges such as racism, sexism, heterosexism, poverty, and social class disparities, among others. This course is primarily oriented toward the practices of religious communities and institutions, such as churches and para-church organizations.

What difference does attending to the lived experiences and perspectives of women make as we theorize about knowledge, education, religions, theology, and Christian practices? This course attempts to explore these questions through works that take seriously the voices and practices of women as they relate to knowledge construction, education, and faith development within religious communities, particularly Christian communities. The course has three interconnected foci: feminist, womanist, and postcolonial epistemologies; exemplars of women’s involvement in education as practices of freedom; and women’s development in religious communities. The first two areas attempt to broaden the conversation about what counts as knowledge (and who gets to decide) and to explore ways that women have participated in liberation struggles in academic and public arenas. In the last area, students explore some of the ways that women’s development has not been taken seriously in religious communities.

3900,202401,1,Preaching on the Gospel of Mark,"Since the earliest decades of the Christian movement, the dramatic Gospel of Mark has been cherished as an authoritative witness to the purposes of God in Jesus of Nazareth. Mark offers much of value for the preacher’s consideration: narratives of the hiddenness and disclosure of Jesus as the Son of God and the Holy One of God; storytelling that underscores the urgency of discipleship and its grounding in compassion for the Other; rhetoric about healings and exorcisms as boundary-crossing acts that defy and defeat cosmic forces of oppression; and misunderstanding, conflict, and fear as inevitable dimensions of following Christ. In this course, students engage rich exegetical and literary studies of Mark by New Testament scholars and learn from expert preachers who bring fresh angles from homiletical theory to their engagements with Mark. Students design and preach sermons and micro-homilies that explore the power of the Gospel of Mark for Christian communities of conviction.

With weekly pairings of ancient and contemporary Caribbean texts, the course studies expressions of sorrow therein in their aesthetic and historical specificity. The first and third units of the course pair portions of ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman epic poetry with contemporary Caribbean poetry and novels. Special attention is given to how expressions of sorrow are shaped by epic poetry’s features, such as heroic deeds, divine interventions, descents into the world of the dead, and prophetic visions. The second, middle unit of the course pairs biblical wisdom literature and Greek tragedy with Caribbean plays and memoirs to consider how expressions of sorrow are formed by the philosophical inquiries they dramatize. In short, this course asks how expressions of sorrow relate to broader themes that are as relevant today as always—empire, mortality, and political violence; gender and family relations; and remembrance of the dead and the divine.

""World Christianity"" signifies the re-thinking of the nature of Christianity, the church, and its theology in a post-Western world. The course starts from the geographic and demographic scope of Christianity across the globe today and considers why the proprietorial control of the field by northern churches continues in theology, history, and theological education. Readings begin with the theories of translation of Lamin Sanneh and Andrew Walls that shaped the field in the 1980s and proceed through a variety of approaches centered around history, migration, mission, and public and Pentecostal theologies. There are no separate ""regional"" studies of particular areas of the world church, but the final two weeks of the course are set aside for presentations, when students are invited to construct a project applying the readings to an area of the world church they know well.

3906,202401,1,Continuing Bonds with the Dead through Art,"From the ""lynching memorial"" to memorial tattoos, art seeks to remember the dead. But does it do more? Does art enable the living to maintain an ongoing relationship with those who have died, and if so, how? What happens when we ""encounter"" the dead in and through a work of art? Does the work function differently for those who knew them personally versus those who are ""meeting"" them for the first time? How do such works complicate our understanding of the dead's absence or presence? Through an examination of primarily contemporary works of art, this course explores these questions through the lens of the ""continuing bonds"" model of bereavement, using methods of ""slow looking"" to carefully observe both artistic form and function. We traverse a wide array of visual, literary, liturgical, performative, and digital artistic practices in order to explore both the potential and limitations of art to maintain connections with the dead. As we proceed, our exploration considers the various religious and philosophical frameworks that underlie our understandings of death and the continuing ""existence"" of the dead, and thus influence our reception and interpretation of what these works do. Area V.",,SDQ BUSH-S100 - Sterling Divinity Quadrangle BUSH-S100,T 6pm-8pm,"{""Tuesday"":[[""18:00"",""20:00"",""SDQ BUSH-S100 - Sterling Divinity Quadrangle BUSH-S100"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/560096""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94945/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2600,3022,,,,

In what ways does that tradition see itself as a means for spiritual, social, political, and economic liberation, seeking the establishment of just, merciful, and compassionate societies? How do contemporary Muslim theologians, thinkers, scholars, and jurists interrogate and engage the classical tradition at these ""intersections""? How are Muslims asserting their faith through the expression of these often overlapping identities? These are the key lines of inquiry this course pursues. It is designed as a survey course—comprehensive, not exhaustive. We engage with Islam as a living tradition, a vibrant faith that is constantly and dynamically being developed, challenged, practiced, and lived. The course also provides thoughtful insights into current theological debates and discussions and seeks to center the work of those who are often marginalized by ""dominant"" discourses and theological formulations.

What ethical debates inform church communities’ adoption or rejection of contemporary worship music practices? This interdisciplinary graduate seminar interrogates the relationship between commerce, style, and ethics in contemporary worship music. We address case studies from early twenty-first-century North America, Oceania, and the United Kingdom from a transnational framework that highlights the asymmetrical circulation of musico-religious ideas, practices, capital, and people in the global-political economy. Drawing on literature from music studies and liturgical studies, this course aims to understand this subgenre of global popular music from both historical and ethnographic perspectives. The first part of the course historicizes contemporary worship music and introduces critical themes. The second part of the course focuses on influential contemporary worship groups including Hillsong, Passion, Bethel, and Maverick City. We consider the roles that competing definitions of ""the good,"" sacred and secular constructs, race and ethnicity, imperialism, commerce, and aesthetics play in power-inflected processes of self-making and community-building in late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century global Christianity.

3910,202401,1,Style and Religious Writing and Speech,"When we talk about the ""style"" of an author, speaker, text, or genre, what do we mean? How do we identify, define, and analyze elements that make up a style? How does exploring aspects of style and stylistic choice help us appreciate the nature, function, and intention of religious text and speech? These are questions that are explored in this course. The focus is on providing students with a number of frameworks from language study and linguistics that can be used to analyze, interpret, and discuss choices and strategies in speech and writing in a religious context. Focusing on English and text/speech in Christian traditions, the course covers (among many other topics) how metaphors clarify religious messages and create community, how variation and repetition in word choice create structure but also subvert expectation in religious poetry, and how formulations of speech and writing (e.g., phrases such as ""I believe"" or ""I promise"") accomplish religious acts with real-world consequences. Texts and speech from a number of different genres and periods feature in discussions, hands-on exercises, and creative experimentations, including religious poems and literary works, prayers, sermons, church websites, and creeds. The smaller assignments in the class give students training in exploring aspects of style, and the final project, which can take a number of different shapes, can be adapted to the student's particular commitments, whether religious/congregational, non-profit, educational, creative, literary, linguistic, or others.

All were born Jewish and had their lives defined by the Second World War. All were deeply affected by the teachings of Christ (only Stein actually converted). All died young, two in the same concentration camp. All lived intense and idiosyncratic spiritual lives and forged forms of writing that expressed these.

3912,202401,1,An Introduction to African Diaspora Religions,"This course is an introduction to the field of African diaspora religions (ADR) through a survey of select ethnographic, archival, literary, and cinematographic materials from the late nineteenth century to the present. While organized in chronological order, the course pairs older materials with more recent ones to explore how the field of ADR has formed in response to various disciplinary forces animated by the politics of religion, race, gender, and sexuality in colonial, postcolonial, and post-emancipation contexts. Therefore, the aim of this course is not only to introduce students to the field of ADR but also to cultivate critical reading and writing skills with which to analyze the politics of race, gender, and sexuality in the study of religion. The questions that guide course lectures and discussions are: What frameworks have been used to construct the study of African diaspora religions? What are the racial, gendered, and sexual politics of these frameworks? How have these frameworks transformed over time, and what may be the significance of those transformations for study today?

Utilizing the work of Du Bois, Zorah Neale Hurston, Bernice Johnson Reagon, and others as springboards for analysis, this course explores the full range of music and worship traditions, from their African foundations through slavery to freedom and the contemporary moment. Special attention is paid to the role of music as a source for theology, social teaching, critical theory, and social transformation, to the importance of music within preaching traditions, and to the interactions between these sacred traditions and commercialized popular culture in a capitalist society. The organizational infrastructures for sacred music is explored as specialized platforms for voices excluded from preaching although actively and symbiotically exploited, most particularly women’s and LGBTQ voices.  Area V.",,"PR406 203 - 406 Prospect St., Miller Hall 203",Th 9:30am-11:20am,"{""Thursday"":[[""9:30"",""11:20"",""PR406 203 - 406 Prospect St., Miller Hall 203"",""https:\/\/map.yale.edu\/?id=1910#!m\/559978""]]}",[],[],0.0,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/97015/assignments/syllabus,,,ACTIVE,,,,False,False,False,,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2607,3029,,,,

3918,202401,1,Religion and Neoliberalism,"Neoliberalism is studied by scholars as a political economic ideology that enlists states to engage in the deregulation of capitalist enterprises, the retraction of social welfare initiatives, and the privatization of government functions. As a social logic, neoliberalism is associated with the extension of market rationalities into non-economic spheres of social life. Consequently, neoliberalism is associated with reconfigurations of government, changed social landscapes, and emerging markets and market ideologies. Yet, how have the changes instituted by neoliberalism given shape to conceptualizations and institutionalizations of the ""religious,"" ""spiritual,"" and the ""ethical/moral""? What alignments and conflicts has it generated between reckonings of ""public"" and ""private"" spheres, the sacred and the secular? And, what constellations of knowledge/power, hierarchy, and counter-discourse are produced by entanglements of religion and neoliberalism? This seminar on religion and neoliberalism seeks to answer such questions by: reviewing historical and conceptual materials about neoliberalism, in particular its socio-cultural formations; examining social scientific and humanities texts that present case studies of the religious, spiritual, ethical, and moral manifestations of neoliberalism; distilling theory and studies of neoliberalism to discuss its relevance as an explanatory framework for Covid-19 governmental response and/or to generate speculative ideas about modes of reform, resistance, and alternative political economic rationalities.

Grounded in health equity, this course illuminates how the reproductive oppression of minorities and vulnerable populations of the past are still pervasive today. The course material pushes students to examine how various determinants of health such as race and socioeconomic status affect access and utilization of SRH services, education, and technologies, which ultimately leads to reproductive health disparities and injustice. Although having a foundational understanding of current SRH challenges is important, this course is also solutions and asset focused.

Students consider social and ecological influences on sexual and gender minority health, including migration, community, and neighborhood influences. Social institutions, including religion, school, family, and close relationships, are examined as sources of both stress and support. Given the relevance of individual and collective identity and stress as mechanisms through which stigma impacts sexual and gender minority health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by intersectionality theory, critical postmodern work on identity fluidity and multiplicity across the life course, and minority stress conceptualizations of health.

3966,202401,1,Qualitative Research Methods,"The goal of this course is to introduce graduate students in the social sciences to qualitative research methods. The course is designed to walk students through the process of conducting qualitative research, from the initial steps of deciding on a topic and developing research questions to collecting and analyzing data. To learn how qualitative researchers write books and articles, we examine the relationship between theory, method, and data in four award-winning books based on dissertations and journal articles published in top journals. Throughout the term, students also gain practical experience with typical qualitative methods, learning how to do observations, content analysis, and open-ended interviews. All students do the same observation exercise (going to a grocery store), whereas content analysis and interviews are shaped by each student’s research interests. The course culminates in a final paper, which can either be an analysis of the student’s qualitative data or a proposal for a qualitative research project.",Permission of the instructor is required for all students.

A ""structure"" emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision-making, social revolutions, organizational merges, global finance and trade markets, delinquent youth behaviors, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on. As a methodological approach, SNA refers to a catalog of techniques steeped in mathematical graph theory and now extending to statistical simulation and algebraic models.

With these three epochs came new migrant populations, the rise and fall of state institutions, and a shifting urban landscape where the maligned urban planning of the welfare state was superseded by the luxury architecture of the free market. With a number of thematic seminars and London’s unparalleled archives and galleries to search for evidence, Collecting Postwar London attempts to look for the people, places, and practices that define half a century of national history by looking at the specific and the marginal.

3993,202402,1,Law and Legal History,"Course cancelled. Online Course. This course will introduce students to how to use and make sense of legal sources: statutes, judicial opinions, legislative actions, legal studies, administrative rulings, and legal history, among others. This course is intended for undergraduates who are interested in incorporating law and legal research into their scholarship, from final papers to senior theses. The course will be divided into two ""units,"" the first of which will absorb the first third of the course, and second of which will absorb the final two-thirds of the semester. The first unit will work with statutory and common law, and will instruct students on how to think with and interpret these sources, especially as legal thought has distinct and often very rigid approaches to statutory and judicial sources. The second unit will explore legal history— both the origins of U.S. American legal thought and structures— but we will also delve into legal history itself, focusing on three case studies: the laws and court structures that codified slavery; the laws and legal structures that enacted and justified settler colonialism, settler land claims, the development of the federal administrative structure that controls Native lands, and tribal courts; and the laws and delegation of powers that structure (and continue to structure) immigration. These case studies are in no way meant to offer a comprehensive account of U.S. American legal history, or to offer a totalizing or full account of slavery, immigration, or settler colonialism. Rather, they are an opportunity for students to get direct experience with reading and interpreting the law; with legal research and the distinct architecture of sources for performing that research (HeinOnline); and with scholarship in legal history and legal studies. Throughout the course, we will also reflect more broadly on what legal sources and legal history is good for, and what it might simultaneously occlude. Finally, we will also explore the form and function of the law itself: what it does, what it cannot do, and how those who sought or seek to change it have strategically approached the promises and disappointments of legal reform and intervention. 1 Credit.

3995,202402,1,Drama in Diaspora: South Asian American Theater and Performance,"Online Course. South Asian Americans have appeared on U.S. stages since the late nineteenth century, yet performances created by South Asian American artists have only just begun, in the last thirty years, to successfully dismantle dominant representations of South Asian and South Asian American communities and to imagine new ways of belonging. This seminar introduces you to contemporary works of performance (plays, stand-up sets, multimedia events) written and created by U.S.-based artists of South Asian descent as well as artists of the South Asian diaspora whose works have had an impact on U.S. audiences. With awareness that the South Asian American diaspora comprises multiple, contested, and contingent identities, we investigate how artists have worked to manifest complex representations of South Asian Americans onstage, challenge institutional and professional norms, and navigate the perils and pleasures of becoming visible. 1 Credit.

3996,202402,1,Digital Platforms and Cultural Production,"Online Course. This seminar explores the phenomenon of digital platforms – intermediary infrastructures that connect end-users and complementors. These platforms have emerged in diverse socio-economic contexts, including social media (e.g., Instagram), video streaming (e.g., Twitch), digital labor (e.g., Uber), and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon). The course offers a multidisciplinary perspective on studying these platforms, viewed as an amalgamation of firms and multi-sided markets, each with their own distinctive history, governance, and infrastructures. Throughout this course, we will delve into the transformative role of these platforms in areas such as culture, labor, creativity, and democracy. Our discussions will draw upon comparative cases from the United States and abroad. In addition, the seminar aims to facilitate an in-depth dialogue on contemporary capitalism and the process of cultural production. We will engage with pertinent topics like inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics in the digital age. Students are invited to contribute to these discussions by bringing examples and case studies from their personal experiences. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.

Enrollment subject to the permission of the instructors and satisfactory completion of all required preparatory course work.) This intensive five-week summer workshop takes place in Rome and is designed to provide a broad overview of that city’s major architectural sites, topography, and systems of urban organization. Examples from antiquity to the present day are studied as part of the context of an ever-changing city with its sequence of layered accretions. The seminar examines historical continuity and change as well as the ways in which and the reasons why some elements and approaches were maintained over time and others abandoned. Hand drawing is used as a primary tool of discovery during explorations of buildings, landscapes, and gardens, both within and outside the city. Students devote the final week to an intensive independent analysis of a building or place. M.Arch. I students are eligible to enroll in this course after completing at least three terms.

4028,202402,1,Building Project II,"(Required of first-year M.Arch. I students, early summer.) This course examines the materialization of a building, whereby students are required to physically participate in the construction of a structure that they have designed. By engaging in the act of making, students are exposed to the material, procedural, and technical demands that shape architecture. Construction documents are generated and subsequently put to the test in the field. Students engage in collaboration with each other, and with a client, as they reconcile budgetary, scheduling, and labor constraints, and negotiate myriad regulatory, political, and community agencies. The course seeks to demonstrate the multiplicity of forces that come to influence the execution of an architectural intention, all the while fostering an architecture of social responsibility, providing structures for an underserved and marginalized segment of the community.

4033,202402,1,Globalization and Architecture in and through China,"Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This course delves into the complexities and ambiguities of globalization through architecture. From nineteenth-century treaty ports to Special Economic Zones, from the Silk Road to the Belt and Road Initiative, we will investigate how the built environment and global networks mutually condition each other. As knowledge, money, and materials circulate globally, they transform how architecture interacts with its surroundings. Architecture serves as a medium through which supranational institutions and corporations thrive and expand. Using China as its entry point, this course enriches the understanding of modern architecture by revealing how styles, environments, and technologies travel beyond their places of origin. 


Capitalizing on infrastructural investments and architectural construction in Africa, South Africa, South East Asia, and Europe, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) activates a new mode of globalization based on old geographical affinities that have been dormant for decades, if not centuries. This course contextualizes the BRI through four historical episodes: 1910s-1940s, 1950s-1960s, 1970s-1990s, and 2013 until now. Each period corresponds with a different world conception, which this course will show through a series of architectural projects. China as a site and an actor is important because holes in the global network are as constructive as the network itself. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

4099,202402,1,Writing About Cities,"Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Big cities present a unique set of opportunities and challenges. They are hubs of art and culture, media and entertainment, business and finance, and food. They serve as canvases for architects and urban planners with visions for the future. They represent the greatest potential for diverse populations to intersect and thrive. At the same time, cities are often sites of injustice, economic inequality, violence, and social division. Cities constantly challenge us to forge communities on a large scale and to learn how to live harmoniously with each other. 


In this course, we will explore city life through reading and writing about cities in several non-fiction modes. Major assignments will include a literary personal essay, a reported journalistic feature (which can be a profile), a film review about a city film, and a policy memo/proposal about a change to city infrastructure. We will supplement our course readings in these four genres with short readings in other genres, as well as with other kinds of ""texts"" (images, films, recorded talks). We will also look for opportunities to use New Haven, the city around us, as a source and a test case for our ideas. Through our study and practice of non-fiction writing for a range of audiences, we will seek to join an ongoing (written) conversation about the past, present, and future of the modern city.

4114,202402,1,"Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Asian Perspectives","In-person Course. While most social scientists have come to embrace the terms race, ethnicity and migration as everyday concepts for their research, they also comprise some of the most contentious topics in contemporary society. Adding to their complexity is that these terms can take on very different meanings for individuals, organizations and governments from different social contexts. This seminar course offers a context-sensitive reflection on the concepts of race, ethnicity and migration by incorporating voices from migrant and minority groups within and from Asia. While the majority of material focuses on social issues in East Asia, the course will also devote considerable time on case studies from Southeast Asia and South Asia, as well as many transnational studies that span over national and regional boundaries. This course does not seek to provide a definitive answer on how we should understand race, ethnicity and migration. Instead, it is designed to help students understand that different historical and geographical contexts can give rise to different interpretations of the same concepts. 1 Credit.

This course will explore U.S.-Mexican borderlands literature and culture as sites of cultural politics.  The borderlands here is defined by several scholars who have theorized the term as a form of resistance to white supremacy (Americo Paredes), a unique literary formation (Sonia Saldívar), and to name a third space of queerness (Gloria Anzaldúa). Borderlands is always in relation to the political project of Chicana/o/x Studies. This course will introduce you to key works in borderlands literature from the mid-twentieth century to our contemporary moment. The novels chosen will be read in relation to visual and sonic productions that extend themes of the writing. Our goal is to explore how creative writing not only reflects the structural positionalities of people of Mexican descent living within the United States but that also form unique narrative forms, queer racialized subjectivities, and third space languages. The goal of this course is to introduce you to key authors, learn theoretical concepts related to the chosen novels and to reconsider their fictional narratives through musical sound and visual cultures that form a political arena in a given historical, political, and cultural context. 1 Credit.

4120,202402,1,Radical Cinemas in the Global Sixties,"In-person Course. This course explores the ""long"" and ""global"" sixties as a period of political uprising, social transformation, and cultural revolution. Radical change took place on a global scale: the ""Third World"" emerged as a political project in the hope of overcoming a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, war, slavery, patriarchy, exploitation. Another revolution took place in cinema: in the context of global uprisings, filmmakers sought to not only show reality, but to change it. Slogans like ""the camera as a gun"" linked the filmmaker to a guerrilla fighter. Their subjects were militant mothers, revolutionary poets, rebellious students, combative peasants and workers. They experimented with alternative strategies of storytelling and capturing reality: nonlinear narrative, montage, mobile cameras, music, dance, documentary, testimony. The sixties challenge our conception of the audiovisual medium. We will study this exceptional period in global cinema through examples from Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, France, India, Senegal, the US, and elsewhere. Students will learn to incorporate formal film analysis into an analysis of ideology, production, circulation, and consumption; broaden their film historical knowledge; and develop skills to construct compelling arguments about the politics of images.

4121,202402,1,Peak Television,"Online Course. Spurred on by rapid technological and cultural change, television content and business forms have evolved dramatically in the past twenty years. Digital media has absorbed television into a broader category of serialized content that is now intermediated by all manners of consumptive platforms and delivery systems.

4135,202402,1,What Didn't Make it into the Bible,"Online Course. Over two billion people alive today consider the New Testament to be sacred scripture. But how did the books that made it into the bible get there in the first place? Who decided what was to be part of the bible and what wasn't? How did these decisions affect the structure of nascent Christian communities, their relationship to surrounding Greco-Roman and Jewish society, and the subsequent development of Christian churches?  How would the history of the world's largest organized religion look differently if a given book didn't make the final cut and another one did? Hundreds of ancient Christian texts are not included in the New Testament. ""What Didn't Make It into the Bible"" focuses on these excluded writings and uses them to help reconstruct the earliest Christian communities. We will explore Gnostic gospels, hear of a five-year-old Jesus throwing temper tantrums while killing (and later resurrecting) his classmates, peruse ancient Christian romance novels, tour heaven and hell, read the garden of Eden story told from the perspective of the snake, and learn how the world will end. 1 Credit.

4136,202402,1,Early Modern Travel Narratives of the Americas,"Online Course. The early modern travel narrative provided the primary source of knowledge about the Americas to the European public. The information and perspectives presented within these narratives offer historians insight into both empirical observations and historical perceptions of the New World. The European imagination often shaped what the travel narrator paid attention to, expected to see, and documented in the text. We will read with and against the grain to attend to silences, tropes, and caricatures within the documents. We will learn from scholars of race and ethnicity, Indigenous studies, Black diaspora, women, gender, and sexuality studies, and borderlands studies to provide them the tools, vocabulary, and theories to articulate their own ideas. Furthermore, the course will engage literary theories to examine the travel narrative as a historical literary genre, and we will consider paratextual information including annotations, errors, in-line edits, illustrations, and captions in order to piece together their interpretations. The goal of this course is twofold: to introduce you to the history of early modern Atlantic empires and, subsequently, to provide you with the skills and informative scholarship to interrogate the power dynamics of the historical archive. You will emerge from the course better understanding the early modern European state of knowledge on the Americas and the skills to grapple with the costs and consequences of colonialism and imperialism both historically and in the present-day.

We will examine the social, political, legislative, and regulatory histories of the welfare state during the twentieth century, ultimately considering how these histories shaped the contemporary health and welfare apparatus and our current moment. Students will critically consider the meanings of ""sickness,"" ""health,"" and ""poverty"" in this course. Further, the seminar will acquaint students with federalism and theories of ""the state,"" as well as provide them an understanding of the mechanics of the US welfare system; the ways it shaped and was shaped by constructions of gender, race, disability, and class; and how it has overlapped with the carceral state. Readings throughout the course will urge students to consider how poverty and health are measured, who they are measured by, and what it has meant to be poor and/or unhealthy in the United States during the twentieth century. This is a reading-intensive course designed for undergraduate students who have an interest in US history. While a prior introduction to US history is helpful, no prerequisite is required. Any student excited about the topic and willing to sharpen their analytical, investigative, and reading skills is welcome. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

4138,202402,1,The Global Right: From the French Revolution to the American Insurrection,"Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the questions: what constitutes the right? What are the central principles and values of those groups associated with this designation? And what are the defining features of what is commonly referred to as the ""global right?"" It will do so by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating various movements and ideologies associated with the Right in America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus will be on mapping the intellectual similarities and differences between various right-wing ideologies. The ""Right"" emerged alongside its counterpoint, the ""left,"" as early as 1692 to describe the congregation patterns surrounding the French Monarch, but it was not until the Revolution of 1789 when it gained its current political meaning. As the French Chamber of Deputies debated the rights of man and royal veto powers it was suggested that opponents to these measures sit du côté droit, while supporters place themselves du côté gauche. The division, many complained, was too absolute and left no room for nuance or political idiosyncrasies. Yet the arrangement held, the terms stuck, and by mid-century the right had begun to be a catchall for a host of political groups, including conservatives, traditionalists, authoritarians, royalists, nationalists and papists. By the twentieth century the term would be stretched to include movements ranging from Fascism to Populism and would be used to describe the political position of political parties in the Middle East and Asia. Though primarily associated with European and parliamentary politics, increasingly the designation of the right has been applied to Evangelical and Judeo-Christian groups in the United States. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

4140,202402,1,Global Warming - The Historical Context of Climate Change,"In-person Course. The course will examine what and how we know about past climate change and what role these changes played in historical societal adaptations. We will explore the deep history of Earth's climate system and how a wide variety of human societies have understood and responded to sudden and longer term changes, why this matters for understanding current climate change, and how historical experience might inform policies and adaptations in the future. The reasons for the rise and fall of human civilizations have been debated in the West since Edward Gibbon published the first installment of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in 1776. As great as Gibbon’s work is, it was actually the 14th century Islamic historian Ibn Khaldun who first theorized the basic ideas of why and how states rise and fall. From Gibbon onward there has been considerable work in several fields, among them History, Archaeology, Economics, Sociology and Political Science, addressing the basic question: Are some societies more durable than others? Why was the Roman Empire enduring while the empires of the ancient Near East experienced cycles of rise and decline? The idea that history moved in ""cycles"" or ""waves"" was first made popular by Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (1918-22), although the cyclical idea of history goes back to the ancient Greeks. It has come roaring back into fashion in recent historical work and in popular discourse as well. It was made especially popular by Malcolm Gladwell in his The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. This kind of thinking can explain much, but not everything, about patterns in human history and behavior. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

4159,202402,1,Trust–and Mistrust,"Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one's trust in someone, some group or some thing – or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, ""truth decay,"" and even the idea of ""a post-truth culture."" In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions? Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28.

Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student’s performance in it.  The report must include the grade (P/F). These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student’s residential college dean. Students are expected to work well in advance to prepare their project description and secure the required approvals, all of which must be submitted to summer.session@yale.edu by no later than the relevant application deadline, listed at summer.yale.edu.

4176,202402,1,Introduction to Linguistics,"Online Course. This is a course about language as a window into the human mind and language as glue in human society. Nature, nurture, or both? Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underly all human languages, and what makes language special. We study language sounds, how words are formed, how humans compute meaning, as well as language in society, language change, and linguistic diversity. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28.

4177,202402,1,"Bilingual Imaginaries: Thinking, Writing, and Living across Languages","Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This course examines what it means to exist in more than one language. For some, another language might be natively known, or laboriously acquired to the point of fluency in adult years; others may live with a second language that has been partially lost, suppressed, or broken (and perhaps later revived and reclaimed). We will read poems, plays, short stories, and novels in which various proficiencies in another language are met with restlessness, exuberance, anxiety, humor, and ingenuity. Thinking about how language and identity are bound together in vital and surprisingly elastic ways, we will consider how knowledge of a second language can impress itself on the imagination, on literature—even on one’s very sense of self. 1 Credit.

4257,202402,1,Philosophy and Technology,"In-person Course. The last few years have witnessed significant improvements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies. Within our lifetimes, it may become possible to spend time in extremely realistic computer simulated worlds, populated by artificially intelligent agents. This prospect forces us to grapple with a host of important questions, including: whether artificially intelligent agents will ever achieve consciousness and moral status; whether we could survive ‘uploading’ our minds into a virtual reality; whether or not this would be good for us; and whether we can know if we are already living inside a simulation. In this class we will discuss all of those questions, as well as several ethical dilemmas posed by present-day technologies like dating apps and self-driving cars. (Is it immoral to ‘swipe left’ on potential romantic partners based on physical appearance? How should self-driving cars handle ethical trade-offs?) The class will not presume any background in philosophy or technology studies, and will use technological developments as a springboard into philosophy. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

Protesting has been normalized as a type of political participation, but mass protests appear to have lost momentum. Under what conditions does a protest start? Do protests succeed? Can repression kill protest movements? Focusing on recent protest movements worldwide, this seminar will address these and other questions to understand protests’ potential impact better. 1 Credit.

4284,202402,1,Introduction to Indian Philosophy,"Course cancelled. In-person Course. Philosophy in India has a venerable history: analytically demanding and conceptually innovative; rigorous, daring, theoretically innovative and potentially transformative—its ongoing story involves some of the oldest traditions of thought in the world while somehow still remaining cutting edge: Is their consciousness in deep sleep? Do humans admit of distinctions of natural kinds (as some have maintained with caste or race)? Are absences a true part of the furniture of the world and can we see them? Are we nothing but bodies? Can it be possibly true that ultimately nothing exists? By exploring questions such as these, this course introduces students to some of the practices, concepts, and arguments necessary to take up further study in this exciting subject. No background knowledge is presupposed, though the virtues of curiosity and delight in puzzling out problems are invaluable. At the end of the course, students will also get to use a philosophy textbook prepared for premodern students in a premodern Indian Buddhist university. Students at the end of this course will gain access to concepts and practices that will enable them to pursue further work in this area or other relevant areas of contemporary philosophical debate. 1 Credit.

4311,202402,1,Reading Sexuality,"Course cancelled. Online Course. This course investigates the literary archive of queer and trans desire in America since World War I. Drawing on aesthetic and theoretical texts, we will examine the way sexuality articulates within economic, racial, and political formations. Our historical survey begins with the queer poets of the Harlem Renaissance, and Saidiya Hartman’s speculative Black feminist history of alternative sexualities in the early 20th century. From there we turn to post-World War II visions of sexual difference, from Frank O’Hara and Andy Warhol’s camp cosmopolitanism to Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde’s radical feminist intimacies. The course concludes with two interrelated conversations. First, an interrogation of the enmeshment of race, class, and desire in neoliberal America, as explored in Samuel Delaney’s experimental memoir Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, AIDS elegies by Essex Hemphill and John Keene, and philosophical readings by theorists such as Cathy Cohen and Jasbir Puar. Secondly, a comparison of the way Queer Studies and Trans Studies approach questions of embodiment, agency, and the erotics of politics. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Tuition: $5070.
